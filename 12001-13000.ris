AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are serious psychiatric disorders with substantial health risks. Asenapine is a new second-generation antipsychotic, available as a sublingual tablet, approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe manic episodes in adults, and in US for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in adults and adolescents. In this review, we searched the available literature to appreciate the role of asenapine in the management of psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorders and schizophrenia and describe its mechanism of action, efficacy and tolerability. Asenapine has demonstrated efficacy in the management of bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, while a possible role in the management of borderline personality disorder and agitation needs further research. Asenapine has favourable side effects profile and combining with other pharmacological treatment in post-traumatic stress disorder has shown promising results. Asenapine fulfils important requirements of efficacy and tolerability as an anti-psychotic. These findings should support psychiatrists and pharmacists in the care of their patients while on asenapine.

AB  - PurposeThis review aims to summarise the evidence on the impact of news media and social media reports of severe mental illness (SMI) on stigma, and interventions that aim to mitigate any adverse impact.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases was conducted in December 2017 to identify studies that report on the impact of media coverage or media interventions on stigma related to schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mental illness in general. Data were synthesised narratively.Results12 studies met inclusion criteria; seven explored the impact of news media on stigma towards SMI or general mental illness, two explored the impact of social media, while three evaluated interventions that aimed to mitigate this impact. These studies showed that positive news reports and social media posts are likely to lead to reductions in stigmatizing attitudes and negative reports and social media posts are likely to increase stigmatizing attitudes. There were a limited number of interventions aiming to mitigate the negative impact of news reports of mental illness on stigma; however, these were ineffective. Interventions with media professionals appear to be successful at reducing their stigmatizing attitudes, but can also act to increase both positive and negative reports in the media.ConclusionsGiven the limited research evidence on the impact of news and social media on stigma towards SMI, and on the effectiveness of interventions aiming to mitigate this impact, further studies of higher quality are needed in this area. Due to mixed findings, interventions with media professionals are also an area of research priority.

AB  - Objectives Fatigue, a common complaint in workers, has been related to sickness absence (SA). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the prospective association between fatigue and SA in the working population.
   Methods An electronic literature search was conducted in five databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Psyc-INFO and Cochrane CENTRAL. Longitudinal studies were selected that focused on fatigue and future SA in workers. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted and pooled estimates [95% confidence intervals (CI)] were obtained for the association between fatigue and risk of long-term SA in total and by sex. Heterogeneity was assessed by I-2 statistics.
   Results Of the 16 included studies in the review; 14 provided supportive evidence for an association between fatigue and SA. The meta-analysis of 9 studies (provided 15 estimates) that were mostly of high quality showed that baseline fatigue increased the risk of long-term SA by 35% (95% CI 1.23-1.47) in workers. Heterogeneity was low-moderate (I-2=40%). The pooled estimates for an increased risk for long-term SA were 35% (95% CI 1.18-1.54) in fatigued men and 22% (95% CI 0.93-1.60) in fatigued women however this relationship was not statistically significant.
   Conclusion There is conclusive evidence for the prospective association between worker fatigue and long-term SA. Whereas most studies in the review measured chronic fatigue and long-term SA, there was insufficient data for the meta-analysis to draw conclusions on fatigue type. Future research is needed in this area as well as greater exploration of fatigue and long-term SA in women.

TI  - National Policies and Older People's Healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review
KW  - INTEGRATING MENTAL-HEALTH
AB  - Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is undergoing a rapid demographic change, with more people reaching old age. There is, however, little information available about healthcare policies with regards to this age group in this region of the world.
   Objectives: This scoping review aims to map the healthcare policies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after the 2002 United Nations Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA) with an eye towards to identifying strategies for promoting older people's access to health care, integration of older people's diseases into primary health care and the level of training and research in geriatrics and gerontology in SSA.
   Methods: This review adopted Arskey and O'Malley's five-step methodology for scoping review and used the guide by Levac et al to operationalize the steps. Potentially relevant literature in English published between January 2003 and December 2017 was identified through PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, and manual search. Articles that related to ageing in SSA in line with the aims of the review were included. The identified articles were independently assessed by the authors and the decision on the articles to be included was reached by a consensus.
   Findings: A total of 363 articles were identified through the databases and manual search of which only 4.7% (17/363) of the articles were included in the review. The findings showed that many SSA countries have formulated policies on healthy ageing and a few have policies to promote access to health care for the older people. The integration of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) management into primary health care (PHC) is encouraging but mental health appears to have been completely neglected. Training and research in gerontology and geriatrics are hardly supported by governments in SSA.
   Conclusions: Significant progress has been made by the SSA countries in policy formulation with regards to older persons but not much has been achieved with the implementation of the policies.

AB  - Multiple epidemiologic studies demonstrate a disparity in suicide risk between sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual) and heterosexual populations; however, both exposure (sexual minority status) and outcome (suicide attempts) may be affected by information bias related to errors in self-reporting. We therefore applied a Bayesian misclassification correction method to account for possible information biases. A systematic literature search identified studies of lifetime suicide attempts in sexual minority and heterosexual adults, and frequentist meta-analysis was used to generate unadjusted estimates of relative risk. A Bayesian model accounting for prior information about sensitivity and specificity of exposure and outcome measures was used to adjust for misclassification biases. In unadjusted frequentist analysis, the relative risk of lifetime suicide attempt comparing sexual minority with heterosexual groups was 3.38 (95% confidence interval: 2.65, 4.32). In Bayesian reanalysis, the estimated prevalence was slightly reduced in heterosexual adults and increased in sexual minority adults, yielding a relative risk of 4.67 (95% credible interval: 3.94, 5.73). The disparity in lifetime suicide attempts between sexual minority and heterosexual adults is greater than previously estimated, when accounting for multiple forms of information bias. Additional research on the impact of information bias in studies of sexual minority health should be pursued.

AB  - Objectives The widespread application of nano-enabled products and the increasing likelihood for workplace exposures make understanding engineered nanomaterial (ENM) effects in exposed workers a public and occupational health priority. The aim of this study was to report on the current state of knowledge on possible adverse effects induced by ENM in humans to determine the toxicological profile of each type of ENM and potential biomarkers for early detection of such effects in workers.
   Methods A systematic review of human studies and epidemiological investigations of exposed workers relative to the possible adverse effects for the most widely used ENM was performed through searches of major scientific databases including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed.
   Results Twenty-seven studies were identified. Most of the epidemiological investigations were cross-sectional. The review found limited evidence of adverse effects in workers exposed to the most commonly used ENM. However, some biological alterations are suggestive for possible adverse impacts. The primary targets of some ENM exposures were the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Changes in biomarker levels compared with controls were also observed; however, limited exposure data and the relatively short period since the first exposure may have influenced the incidence of adverse effects found in epidemiological studies.
   Conclusions There is a need for longitudinal epidemiologic investigations with clear exposure characterizations for various ENM to discover potential adverse health effects and identify possible indicators of early biological alterations. In this state of uncertainty, precautionary controls for each ENM are warranted while further study of potential health effects continues.

AB  - Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common, accelerate the conversion to dementia, and are associated with increased caregiver burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Objective: The aim of this study is to identify potential associations between the core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid/tau) and NPS in AD/MCI.
   Methods: For this systematic review, four databases, PubMed (1946-2018), Cochrane (2005-2018), EMBASE (1947-2018), and PsycINFO (1806-2018) were searched for relevant observational studies using an extensive list of keywords. English studies were selected for critical appraisal based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were defined as 1) at least one AD CSF biomarker has been measured; 2) at least one NPS has been assessed; and 3) analysis has been done to examine the association between core AD CSF biomarker and NPS (main outcome) Animal, postmortem, and review studies were excluded.
   Results: In total, 21 studies qualified for the systematic review. The overall picture regarding the association between NPS and AD CSF biomarkers is conflicting. However, agitation/aggression was significantly and consistently related to core AD CSF biomarkers. Moreover, depression was the only NPS to occasionally be associated with lower core AD CSF pathology.
   Conclusion: Our study has revealed agitation/aggression as the most consistent NPS related to core AD CSF biomarkers. Future studies are required to focus on other neglected NPS domains such as disinhibition. Moreover, why depression was the only NPS inversely associated with core AD CSF pathology remains to be elucidated. Our study also revealed a great degree of heterogeneity, hence calling for a more standardized "objective" approach for the evaluation of NPS.

AB  - Ionizing radiation (IR) produces multiple types of damage to nucleic acids, proteins and other crucial cellular components. Nevertheless, various microorganisms from phylogenetically distant taxa (bacteria, archaea, fungi) can resist IR levels many orders of magnitude above natural background. This intriguing phenomenon of radioresistance probably arose independently many times throughout evolution as a byproduct of selective pressures from other stresses (e.g. desiccation, UV radiation, chemical oxidants). Most of the literature on microbial radioresistance is based on acute gamma-irradiation experiments performed in the laboratory, typically involving pure cultures grown under near-optimal conditions. There is much less information about the upper limits of radioresistance in the field, such as in radioactively-contaminated areas, where several radiation types (e.g. alpha and beta, as well as gamma) and other stressors (e.g. non-optimal temperature and nutrient levels, toxic chemicals, interspecific competition) act over multiple generations. Here we discuss several examples of radioresistant microbes isolated from extremely radioactive locations (e.g. Chernobyl and Mayak nuclear plant sites) and estimate the radiation dose rates they were able to tolerate. Some of these organisms (e.g. the fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides, the cyanobacterium Geitlerinema cunphibium) are widely-distributed and colonize a variety of habitats. These examples suggest that resistance to chronic IR and chemical contamination is not limited to rare specialized strains from extreme environments, but can occur among common microbial taxa, perhaps due to overlap between mechanisms of resistance to IR and other stressors.

AB  - Background: Ensuring the strength of the physician workforce is essential to optimizing patient care. Challenges that undermine the profession include inequities in advancement, high levels of burnout, reduced career duration, and elevated risk for mental health problems, including suicide. This narrative review explores whether physicians within four subpopulations represented in the workforce at levels lower than predicted from their numbers in the general population-women, racial and ethnic minorities in medicine, sexual and gender minorities, and people with disabilities-are at elevated risk for these problems, and if present, how these problems might be addressed to support patient care. In essence, the underlying question this narrative review explores is as follows: Do physician workforce disparities affect patient care? While numerous articles and high-profile reports have examined the relationship between workforce diversity and patient care, to our knowledge, this is the first review to examine the important relationship between diversity-related workforce disparities and patient care. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO Discovery Service) were searched by a librarian. Additional resources were included by authors, as deemed relevant to the investigation. Results: The initial database searches identified 440 potentially relevant articles. Articles were categorized according to subtopics, including (1) underrepresented physicians and support for vulnerable patient populations; (2) factors that could exacerbate the projected physician deficit; (3) methods of addressing disparities among underrepresented physicians to support patient care; or (4) excluded (n=155). The authors identified another 220 potentially relevant articles. Of 505 potentially relevant articles, 199 (39.4%) were included in this review. Conclusions: This report demonstrates an important gap in the literature regarding the impact of physician workforce disparities and their effect on patient care. This is a critical public health issue and should be urgently addressed in future research and considered in clinical practice and policy decision-making.

AB  - The aim of the present article is to provide an update on recent research on stress, fatigue and wellbeing and discuss the implications for naval personnel. There is now considerable information on these topics in onshore civilian populations and some research on seafarers and other military personnel. This generic information can now be used to address these issues in naval personnel. In order to do this there is a need to consider specific naval contexts and to collect data to confirm the applicability of established methods and models to the navy.

AB  - We report an arrangement on the effect of anthropogenic litter on marine and estuarine reptiles, checking for evidence about different types of impact (ingestion vs. entanglement) and pressure (three size-based categories). From 1976 to 2018, we obtained a blacklist of 11 species impacted by marine litter (about 13% of 85 species of marine and estuarine reptiles), belonging to three orders (Testudines, Squamata, and Crocodilia). We obtained only occasional evidence of an impact for Squamata (Hidrophis elegans, Disteira major) and Crocodilia (Crocodylus porosus). Regarding the different types of pressure, the highest number of evidence has been obtained for macro-litter (10 species) and the lowest for micro-litter (4 species, all Chelonidae). Among Testudines, Lepidochelys kempii and Natator depressus evidenced a lack of data for micro-plastic. In Squamata, information is lacking for micro-plastic with only occasional references for meso-plastic (in Hydrophis elegans) and macro-plastic (Disteira major and Crocodylus porosus). We obtained a direct correlation between the research effort and the number of citations regarding different types of pressure and impact of marine litter: therefore, our blacklist of impacted species could be increased, carrying out further research focused on other poorly studied marine and estuarine reptiles. We suggest the use of a standardized nomenclature to reduce the amount of lost information.

AB  - The authors aimed to characterize the current evidence base regarding musicians' musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS), in order to identify gaps for future research. A systematic search was conducted to identify peer-review studies published in English in 2007-2016 that investigated musicians' MSS. Narrative reviews, case reports, protocols, and questionnaire or program development papers were excluded. Data were synthesized descriptively in order to identify gaps in the current evidence base. Five systematic reviews and 153 primary studies (133 unique) were included in this review. The majority (71%) of studies investigated professional musicians and/or university music students, with orchestral musicians being the most commonly investigated group. The majority of studies investigated the extent of the problem (68%) and/or associated factors (54%). Eight studies compared the prevalence of MSS outcomes with other populations. A range of risk factors were investigated; however, few studies used longitudinal designs. A total of 16 intervention studies were identified (3 clinical, 13 public health), with 12 investigating education or exercise programs. There is a need for research into musicians beyond classical university music students and professional orchestral musicians, and these musical sub-groups should be compared to determine the most at risk groups of musicians. Studies looking at potential risk factors should move towards longitudinal designs so that the temporal relationship of these factors and MSS could be established, where cross-sectional designs have indicated that an association exists. Intervention studies should be based upon the risk factors identified, and extend beyond education and exercise programs.

AB  - Background
   Depression is considered to have the highest disability burden of all conditions. Although treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a key contributor to that burden, there is little understanding of the best treatment approaches for it and specifically the effectiveness of available augmentation approaches.
   Aims
   We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to search and quantify the evidence of psychological and pharmacological augmentation interventions for TRD.
   Method
   Participants with TRD (defined as insufficient response to at least two antidepressants) were randomised to at least one augmentation treatment in the trial. Pre-post analysis assessed treatment effectiveness, providing an effect size (ES) independent of comparator interventions.
   Results
   Of 28 trials, 3 investigated psychological treatments and 25 examined pharmacological interventions. Pre-post analyses demonstrated N-methyl-D-aspartate-targeting drugs to have the highest ES (ES = 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.71). Other than aripiprazole (four studies, ES = 1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.44) and lithium (three studies, ES = 1.00, 95% CI 0.81-1.20), treatments were each investigated in less than three studies. Overall, pharmacological (ES = 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.30) and psychological (ES = 1.43, 95% CI 0.50-2.36) therapies yielded higher ESs than pill placebo (ES = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91) and psychological control (ES = 0.94, 95% CI 0.36-1.52).
   Conclusions
   Despite being used widely in clinical practice, the evidence for augmentation treatments in TRD is sparse. Although pre-post meta-analyses are limited by the absence of direct comparison, this work finds promising evidence across treatment modalities.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases are still the most common cause of death from natural causes among seafarers. The aim of the study was to determine which of the cardiovascular risk factors listed in the current recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology occur among seafarers.
   Materials and methods: The paper is a review of literature from PubMed Database.
   Results: Based on conducted analysis of over 31 papers high prevalence of classic and other cardiovascular risk factors among seafarers was proven. The most common risk factors among off-shore workers are overweight and obesity (over 64%); moreover, these factors occur more often among seafarers than in the general population. Also hypertension, smoking, type 2 diabetes and unfavourable lipid profile were present more often in this occupational group. In the analysed studies attention was also paid to factors often overlooked in risk assessment such as mental and inflammatory illnesses, unfavourable working conditions and psychological burden.
   Conclusions: Seafarers have a higher cardiovascular risk because, among other things, the prevalence of "old and new" risk factors among them is higher than in general population.

AB  - Background: Affective symptoms are considered a risk factor or prodromal symptom for dementia. Recent reviews indicate that depressive symptoms predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, but results need to be further explored.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of depressive symptoms on the development of dementia in people with MCI, and explore potential sources of between-study variability, including study setting by a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: Databases were searched for prospective studies defining people with MCI at baseline, investigating dementia at follow-up and giving information about depressive symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies and rated the methodological quality. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect models to yield pooled risk ratios (RR). Meta-regression analyses tested differences between clinical and community-based studies and other sources of heterogeneity.
   Results: Thirty-five studies, representing 14,158 individuals with MCI, were included in the meta-analysis. Depressive symptoms in MCI predicted dementia in 15 community-based studies (RR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.49-1.93, I-2 = 0.0%), but not in 20 clinical studies (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.14, I-2 = 73.0%). Further investigation of this effect showed that the mean age of community-based studies was significantly higher than of clinical studies but neither this nor other study characteristics explained variability in study outcomes.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with an increased risk of conversion from MCI to dementia in community-based studies. In contrast, evidence in clinical populations was insufficient with high heterogeneity.

AB  - The effects of health inequities on transgender (or trans) and gender diverse populations have been well documented internationally. Studies that compared the mental health of trans and gender diverse populations to cisgender populations found significant inequities for mental health problems. There has been very little research on this topic, however, from Aotearoa/New Zealand. We conducted database search in the PsycINFO, as well as manual searches for published grey literature in Aotearoa/New Zealand to identify theoretical and empirical literature on social determinants of health and related frameworks to explain the effects of social environments on health inequities experienced by trans and gender diverse people. We also complement international studies by considering Maori and Pacific trans and gender diverse identities and the ramifications of colonisation on the mental health and wellbeing of these populations.

AB  - Homeostatic regulation of class II programmed cell death/autophagy for the degradation and elimination of substandard organelles and defective proteins is decisive for the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), one of the most highly dedicated self-sacrificing events, is accountable for the partial elimination of redundant soluble cytoplasmic proteins in Parkinson's disease (PD). CMA is characterized by the selective delivery of superfluous protein containing lysine-phenylalanine-glutamate-arginine-glutamine (KFERQ)/KFERQ-like motif to the lysosome through molecular chaperones, such as heat shock cognate-70 (Hsc-70). KFERQ/KFERQ-like motif present in the poor quality cytoplasmic substrate protein and Hsc-70 complex is recognized by a janitor protein, which is referred to as the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2A (LAMP-2A). This protein is known to facilitate an entry of substrate-chaperone complex in the lumen for hydrolytic cleavage of substrate and elimination of end-products. Impaired CMA is repeatedly blamed for an accumulation of surplus soluble proteins. However, it is still an enigma if CMA is a bonus or curse for PD. Case-control studies and cellular and animal models have deciphered the contribution of impaired CMA in PD. Current article updates the role of CMA in toxicant models and recapitulates the evidences that have highlighted a link between impaired CMA and PD. Although PD is an irreversible happening and CMA is a dual edging phenomenon, it is anticipated that fine-tuning of the latter encounters the former to a certain extent. Besides, the truth, embellishment, and propaganda regarding the issue are also emphasized in the final segment of the article.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the depletion of striatal dopamine and the presence of Lewy aggregates containing alpha-synuclein. Clinically, there are motor impairments involving cardinal movement symptoms, bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and postural abnormalities, along with non-motor symptoms such as sleep, behavior and mood disorders. The current treatment for PD focuses on restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa), which loses therapeutic efficacy and induces disabling abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) after several years. Evidence indicates that the pathophysiology of both PD and LID disorders is also associated with the dysfunctional activity of the serotonergic (5-HT) neurons that may be responsible for motor and non-motor disturbances. The main population of 5-HT neurons is located in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN), which provides extensive innervation to almost the entire neuroaxis and controls multiple functions in the brain. The degeneration of DRN 5-HT neurons occurs in early PD. These neurons can also take exogenous levodopa to transform it into dopamine, which may disturb neuron activity. This review will provide an overview of the underlying mechanisms responsible for 5-HT dysfunction and its clinical relevance in PD and dyskinesia.

AB  - Multivariate pattern analysis and data-driven approaches to understand how the human brain encodes sensory information and higher level conceptual knowledge have become increasingly dominant in visual and cognitive neuroscience; however, it is only in recent years that these methods have been applied to the domain of social information processing. This review examines recent research in the field of social cognitive neuroscience focusing on how multivariate pattern analysis (e.g., pattern classification, representational similarity analysis) and data-driven methods (e.g., reverse correlation, intersubject correlation) have been used to decode and characterize high-level information about the self, other persons, and social groups. We begin with a review of what is known about how self-referential processing and person perception are represented in the medial prefrontal cortex based on conventional activation-based neuroimaging approaches. This is followed by a nontechnical overview of current multivariate pattern-based and data-driven neuroimaging methods designed to characterize and/or decode neural representations. The remainder of the review focuses on examining how these methods have been applied to the topic of self, person perception, and the perception of social groups. In this review, we highlight recent trends (e.g., analysis of social networks, decoding race and social groups, and the use of naturalistic stimuli) and discuss several theoretical challenges that arise from the application of these new methods to the question of how the brain represents knowledge about the self and others.

AB  - Background: Thought records are a core component of Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Over time, thought records have been modified to suit various needs or preferences. A diversity of thought records have been developed, which include differing components and cognitive change strategies. Yet, due to a lack of specificity in the literature and field, different thought records are often treated as though they are interchangeable. Limited extant literature suggests that differing thought records may have unique clinical effects. However, meta-analyzing the comparable or differing effects of the distinct extant thought records is impeded by the lack of a coding system for thought records.
   Objective: The current study sought to prepare a way for further understanding the differential utility and effectiveness of different iterations of thought records by creating a coding system, which is described in detail. This coding system will be used to guide future research into which thought records work best for which problems.
   Method: Thought records were gathered from seminal texts and solicited from the certified members of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy and the American Board of Behavioral and Cognitive Psychology.
   Results: In total, 110 non-identical thought records were gathered and coded into 55 unique combinations. These results demonstrate that the variability of thought records used by qualified therapists extends well beyond those found in seminal CBT texts.
   Conclusion: This broad diversity justifies the need for a coding system to inform future lines of research.

AB  - On the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, investigating the evolution of disaster science is worthwhile and can be used to improve the future execution of disaster risk management. Based on more than 55,786 articles on the relative topic of Disaster derived from the Web of Science Core Collection from 1999-2017, this study employs CiteSpace and Google Earth to identify and visualize the spatial distribution of publications, bursts of keywords and categories, highly cited references, and interdisciplinary levels and then identify the emerging trends of disaster research over the past 20 years. The results show that the earthquake indeed jumpstarted a massive wave of disaster research around the world and increased international cooperation over the last decade. However, in terms of both the quantity and quality of publications in disaster research fields, China is lagging behind the U.S. and European countries. Moreover, although designing disaster prevention and mitigation strategies is a new popular field of disaster science, geological environment changes and geologic hazards triggered by earthquakes are more popular research topics than disaster emergency and recovery. In addition, the transdisciplinary level of disaster science increased after the earthquake. This interdisciplinary characteristic of disaster science gradually increased in popularity, which demonstrates that people can learn from catastrophes. These emerging trends could serve as a scientific basis to clearly understand disaster science progress over the last 20 years and provide a reference for rapidly identifying frontier issues in disaster science.

Although giftedness is typically associated with schooling, gifted individuals exist across academic and nonacademic domains. In this review, we begin by acknowledging some of the larger debates in the field of gifted education and provide brief summaries of major conceptual frameworks applied to gifted education, dividing them into three categories: frameworks focused on ability, frameworks focused on talent development, and integrative frameworks. We then discuss common practices used to identify gifted students, giving specific attention to the identification of those in underrepresented groups, followed by brief overviews of the numbers of students who are classified as gifted, programming options for gifted students, and social and emotional issues associated with being gifted. We conclude with a discussion of several unresolved issues in the field.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world. Unfortunately, most of the currently used clinical therapies against PD are symptomatic and there is still no remedy can stop disease progression. Collective evidence shows that various kinds of exercise may reduce the risk of PD and do have positive impacts on both motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. Additionally, exercise can also ameliorate the side effects such as wearing-off and dyskinesia induced by anti-PD therapeutics. In parallel with its benefits in ameliorating clinical symptoms, exercise modulates a range of supporting systems for brain maintenance and plasticity including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, enhanced metabolism and angiogenesis. Exercise provides all these broad benefits on PD through inhibiting oxidative stress, repairing mitochondrial damage, and promoting the production of growth factors. Moreover, exercise reduces risk of other geriatric diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which may also contribute to PD pathogenesis. In summary, exercise is increasingly considered to be a complementary strategy to PD medications. In this chapter, we summarize the recent research progress on the beneficial effects of exercise on PD, discuss the underlying mechanisms, and highlight the promising prospects of exercise for antiparkinsonian therapy.

AB  - Background: Magnesium (Mg2+), an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has received increased attention recently because of its role in the pathophysiology of and treatment response in depression. However, whether Mg2+ level is decreased in depression is not firmly established. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to help making consensus for the association between Mg2+ levels and depression.Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the electronic database resources PubMed and Embase. After a careful selection of relevant studies, a meta-analysis using the random effects model was conducted in each measuring source, such as serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Results: A total of 18 studies were included in this study. Among 11 studies that measured Mg2+ in the serum, Mg2+ level was lower in patients with depression than in controls (weighted mean difference=-.088, 95% confidence interval=-.164 to -.012). In the sensitivity analysis by removing studies one by one, 2 out of the 11 studies obliterated such significant differences. There were no significant differences in the Mg2+ levels in the studies for plasma and CSF.Conclusions: Despite some evidence supporting an association between decreased Mg2+ levels and depression from studies with serum, the results of our meta-analysis urge to use caution when associating Mg2+ levels and depression. Future studies are needed to establish a consensus for the role of low Mg2+ levels in depression.

AB  - Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) degrades epoxides of fatty acids including epoxyeicosatrienoic acid isomers (EETs), which are produced as metabolites of the cytochrome P450 branch of the arachidonic acid pathway. EETs exert a variety of largely beneficial effects in the context of inflammation and vascular regulation. sEH inhibition is shown to be therapeutic in several cardiovascular and renal disorders, as well as in peripheral analgesia, via the increased availability of anti-inflammatory EETs. The success of sEH inhibitors in peripheral systems suggests their potential in targeting inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Here, we describe the current roles of sEH in the pathology and treatment of CNS disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, dementia and depression. In view of the robust anti-inflammatory effects of stem cells, we also outlined the potency of stem cell treatment and sEH inhibitors as a combination therapy for these CNS disorders. This review highlights the gaps in current knowledge about the pathologic and therapeutic roles of sEH in CNS disorders, which should guide future basic science research towards translational and clinical applications of sEH inhibitors for treatment of neurological diseases.

   Methods MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Thomson Reuters's Web of Science were searched for clinical trials published between 2010 and 2018. We included all prospective experimental studies including randomized controlled trials (RCT) and other clinical trials with more than 10 patients.
   Results Only 11 articles met the inclusion criteria, including 4 RCT, 3 open clinical trials and 5 comparative clinical trials. RCT demonstrated efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in only one of two trials. Neither pindolol nor d-fenfluramine were effective in blocking flumazenil-induced panic attacks. Augmentation with quetiapine was not superior to placebo. Open trials indicated that escitalopram, vortioxetine and TMS may be effective. Comparative trials did not demonstrate superiority from any drug, but confirmed tranylcypromine, paroxetine, clonazepam and alprazolam as effective options.
   Conclusion The current study confirmed the efficacy of tranylcypromine, paroxetine, clonazepam, alprazolam and escitalopram. Vortioxetine and TMS, with duration of 4 or more weeks, also seems to be effective. Quetiapine, pindolol and d-fenfluramine were not considered effective compounds.

AB  - BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal disease that threatens the quality of life of an aging population at a global scale. Various hypotheses on the etiology of AD have been developed over the years to guide efforts in search of therapeutic strategies.Main bodyIn this review, we focus on four AD hypotheses currently relevant to AD onset: the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, the well-recognized tau hypothesis, the increasingly popular pathogen (viral infection) hypothesis, and the infection-related antimicrobial protection hypothesis. In briefly reviewing the main evidence supporting each hypothesis and discussing the questions that need to be addressed, we hope to gain a better understanding of the complicated multi-layered interactions in potential causal and/or risk factors in AD pathogenesis. As a defining feature of AD, the existence of amyloid deposits is likely fundamental to AD onset but is insufficient to wholly reproduce many complexities of the disorder. A similar belief is currently also applied to hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates within neurons, where tau has been postulated to drive neurodegeneration in the presence of pre-existing A plaques in the brain. Although infection of the central nerve system by pathogens such as viruses may increase AD risk, it is yet to be determined whether this phenomenon is applicable to all cases of sporadic AD and whether it is a primary trigger for AD onset. Lastly, the antimicrobial protection hypothesis provides insight into a potential physiological role for A peptides, but how A/microbial interactions affect AD pathogenesis during aging awaits further validation. Nevertheless, this hypothesis cautions potential adverse effects in A-targeting therapies by hindering potential roles for A in anti-viral protection.ConclusionAD is a multi-factor complex disorder, which likely requires a combinatorial therapeutic approach to successfully slow or reduce symptomatic memory decline. A better understanding of how various causal and/or risk factors affecting disease onset and progression will enhance the likelihood of conceiving effective treatment paradigms, which may involve personalized treatment strategies for individual patients at varying stages of disease progression.

AB  - The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) has become one of the most widely-used protocols for inducing moderate psychosocial stress in laboratory settings. Observational coding has been used to measure a range of behavioral responses to the TSST including performance, reactions to the task, and markers of stress induced by the task, with clear advantages given increased objectivity of observational measurement over self-report measures. The current review systematically examined all TSST and TSST-related studies with children and adolescents published since the original work of Kirschbaum et al. (1993) to identify behavioral observation coding approaches for the TSST. The search resulted in 29 published articles, dissertations, and master's theses with a wide range of coding approaches used. The take-home finding from the current review is that there is no standard way to code the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C), which appears to stem from the uniqueness of investigators' research questions and sample demographics. This lack of standardization prohibits conclusive comparisons between studies and samples. We discuss relevant implications and offer suggestions for future research.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consists of acute and long-term pathophysiological sequelae that ultimately lead to cognitive and motor function deficits, with age being a critical risk factor for poorer prognosis. TBI has been recently linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases later in life including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis. The accumulation of iron in the brain has been documented in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and also in normal aging, and can contribute to neurotoxicity through a variety of mechanisms including the production of free radicals leading to oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and by promoting inflammatory reactions. A growing body of evidence similarly supports a deleterious role of iron in the pathogenesis of TBI. Iron deposition in the injured brain can occur via hemorrhage/microhemorrhages (heme-bound iron) or independently as labile iron (non-heme bound), which is considered to be more damaging to the brain. This review focusses on the role of iron in potentiating neurodegeneration in TBI, with insight into the intersection with neurodegenerative conditions. An important implication of this work is the potential for therapeutic approaches that target iron to attenuate the neuropathology/phenotype related to TBI and to also reduce the associated risk of developing neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Background: Neuropsychological assessment is central to identifying and determining the extent of Alcohol-Related Cognitive Impairment (ARCI). The present systematic review aimed to synthesize and discuss the evidence appraising the neuropsychological tests used to assess ARCI in order to support clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate tests for use with this population.
   Methods: We searched for studies investigating the psychometric, diagnostic and practical values of tools used in the screening, diagnosis, and assessment of Korsakoff's Syndrome (KS), Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), and those with a specific diagnosis of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The following databases were searched in March 2016 and again in August 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych-INFO, ProQuest Psychology, and Science Direct. Study quality was assessed using a checklist designed by the authors to evaluate the specific factors contributing to robust and clearly reported studies in this area. A total of 43 studies were included following the screening of 3646 studies by title and abstract and 360 at full-text. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in the tests and ARCI samples investigated in the studies reviewed. Instead, review findings were narratively synthesized and divided according to five domains of assessment: cognitive screening, memory, executive function, intelligence and test batteries, and premorbid ability. Effect sizes (d) were calculated to supplement findings.
   Results: Overall, several measures demonstrated sensitivity to the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcoholism and an ability to differentiate between gradations of impairment. However, findings relating to the other psychometric qualities of the tests, including those important for the accurate assessment and monitoring of ARCI (e.g., test-retest reliability), were entirely absent or limited. Additionally, the synthesis of neuropsychological outcomes presented here supports the recent impetus for a move away from discrete diagnoses (e.g., KS, ARD) and the distinctions between them toward more broad and inclusive diagnostic conceptualizations of ARCI, thereby recognizing the heterogeneity in presentation.
   Conclusions: Based on the evidence reviewed, provisional recommendations for appropriate tests in each domain of assessment are presented, though further validation of most tests is warranted. Review findings can support efficient and evidenced-based test-selection and guide future research in this area.

AB  - Background: There is rapidly emerging interest in music interventions in healthcare. Music interventions are widely applicable, inexpensive, without side effects, and easy to use. It is not precisely known how they exert positive effects on health outcomes. Experimental studies in animal models might reveal more about the pathophysiological mechanisms of music interventions.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of experimental research in rodents. The electronic databases EMBASE, Medline(ovidSP), Web-Of-Science, PsycINFO, Cinahl, PubMed publisher, Cochrane, and Google scholar were searched for publications between January 1st 1960 and April 22nd 2017. Eligible were English-written, full-text publications on experimental research in rodents comparing music vs. a control situation. Outcomes were categorized in four domains brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology. Additionally, an overview was generated representing the effects of various types of music on outcomes. Bias in studies was assessed with the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneous outcomes and lack of original outcome data.
   Results: Forty-two studies were included. Music-exposed rodents showed statistically significant increases in neuro-chemistry, such as higher BDNF levels, as well as an enhanced propensity for neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Furthermore, music exposure was linked with statistically significantly improved spatial and auditory learning, reduced anxiety-related behavior, and increased immune responses. Various statistically significant changes occurred in physiological parameters such as blood pressure and ( para) sympathetic nerve activity following music interventions. The majority of studies investigated classical music interventions, but other types of music exerted positive effects on outcomes as well. The SYRCLE risk of bias assessment revealed unclear risk of bias in all studies.
   Conclusions: Music interventions seem to improve brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology in rodents. Further research is necessary to explore and optimize the effect of music interventions, and to evaluate its effects in humans.

AB  - Gender roles are formed in early childhood and continue to influence behavior through adolescence and adulthood, including the choice of academic majors and careers. In many countries, men are underrepresented in communal roles in health care, elementary education, and domestic functions (HEED fields, Croft et al., 2015), whereas women are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) fields (Beede et al., 2011) and top leadership positions (Leopold et al., 2016). Theories focusing on the development of gender roles suggest that across the lifespan people perceive certain roles to be more or less appropriate for their gender (e.g., Gender Schema Theory, Martin and Halverson, 1981; Social Role Theory, Eagly and Wood, 2011). Specifically, researchers have postulated that observing same-sex role models triggers learning processes whereby observers internalize gender-stereotypical knowledge of roles and act accordingly, which results in gender-congruent aspirations and behavior. It seems reasonable that if observing men and women in gender congruent roles fosters gender-congruent aspirations and behavior, then frequently observing gender-incongruent role models (e.g., male kindergarten teachers or female scientists and leaders) should reduce gender stereotyping and promote gender-counterstereotypical aspirations and behavior. In many countries, governments and societal decision-makers have formed initiatives based on the idea that exposure to gender-counterstereotypical role models influences aspirations and career choices among children, adolescents, and young adults. The present review gives an overview of research-based interventions involving observing or interacting with counterstereotypical role models, particularly focusing on outcomes for girls and women. Extending earlier reviews, we summarize laboratory-based and field-based studies and then critically discuss and integrate the findings in order to provide an overall picture of how counterstereotypical role models shape observers' occupational aspirations and academic choices in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. We conclude by outlining suggestions for future research and briefly discussing implications for future interventions.

AB  - BackgroundIn Europe and elsewhere there is rising concern about inequality in health and increased prevalence of mental ill-health. Structural determinants such as welfare state arrangements may impact on levels of mental health and social inequalities. This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence on whether structural determinants are associated with inequalities in mental health outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies published between 1996 and 2017 based on search results from the following databases Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts and Eric. Studies were included if they focused on inequalities (measured by socio-economic position and gender), structural determinants (i.e. public policies affecting the whole population) and showed a change or comparison in mental health status in one (or more) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. All studies were assessed for inclusion and study quality by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted and synthesised using narrative analysis.ResultsTwenty-one articles (17 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous with regards to methodology, mental health outcomes and policy settings. More comprehensive and gender inclusive welfare states (e.g. Nordic welfare states) had better mental health outcomes, especially for women, and less gender-related inequality. Nordic welfare regimes may also decrease inequalities between lone and couple mothers. A strong welfare state does not buffer against socio-economic inequalities in mental health outcomes. Austerity measures tended to worsen mental health and increase inequalities. Area-based initiatives and educational policy are understudied.ConclusionAlthough the literature on structural determinants and inequalities in mental health is limited, our review shows some evidence supporting the causal effects of structural determinants on mental health inequalities. The lack of evidence should not be interpreted as lack of effect. Future studies should apply innovative methods to overcome the inherent methodological challenges in this area, as structural determinants potentially affect both levels of mental health and social inequalities.

AB  - Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) during pregnancy is a serious public health concern globally. Within Sub-Saharan Africa nearly 40% of women reported abuse by their intimate partners. In Ethiopia, study findings regarding prevalence and associated factors of IPV among pregnant women have been inconsistently reported and highly variable. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled prevalence of IPV and associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
   Methods: International databases (i.e., PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched during the period of January 1 to February 13, 2018. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence of IPV and associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia were considered. Two authors (AA and CT) independently extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format. Extracted quantitative data were analyzed using STATA Version 13. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed through the Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test. Finally, a random effects meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of IPV. Associations between factors and IPV were also examined using a random effects model.
   Results: After reviewing 605 studies, eight studies involving 2691 pregnant women fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The findings of these eight studies revealed that a 26.1% (95% CI: 20, 32.3) overall prevalence of IPV among pregnant women in Ethiopia. The subgroup analysis of this study further revealed the highest observed prevalence was in Oromia region (35%), followed by Amhara region (29%). Motherseducational status (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7), intimate partners' educational status (OR: 3.5, 95%CI: 1.4, 8.5), and intimate partners' alcohol use (OR: 11.4, 95%CI: 2.3, 56.6) were significantly associated with IPV among pregnant women.
   Conclusion: This study found that the prevalence of IPV among pregnant women in Ethiopia was quite common; with slightly more than 1 in 4, pregnant women experienced IPV during pregnancy. Mothers' educational status, intimate partners' educational status, and intimate partners' alcohol use were factors significantly associated with IPV among pregnant women.

AB  - Studies on the association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and levels of catecholamines have yielded inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether concentrations of the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are associated with PTSD. This study searched relevant articles in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc-ARTICLES. Each database was searched from its inception to September, 2018. Data related to catecholamine concentrations were extracted for patients with PTSD and the controls to calculate standardized mean differences and to evaluate effect sizes. A meta-analysis was then performed to compare the concentration of each catecholamine between the two groups in blood and/or urine samples. Heterogeneity was quantified using I-2 and its significance was tested using the Q statistics. Subgroup analyses of the types of controls, PTSD assessment tools, and assayed methods used in the studies were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity among studies. Random-effects models were used to combine results from selected studies. A total of 1,388 articles were identified, of which 27 were included in the final analysis. Heterogeneity was high; hence random-effects models were used to combine results of selected studies. Results revealed significantly higher norepinephrine levels in people with PTSD than in the controls [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13 to 0.57, p = 0.002]. No difference was found in dopamine and epinephrine concentrations between the two groups. Elevated norepinephrine levels may be an important indicator for PTSD.

AB  - Objective: To integrate high-quality evidence of the efficacy of antidepressants across different subtypes of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs).
   Methods: The Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Chinese local database were searched up to October 1, 2017. Keywords included all subtypes of FGIDs, antidepressants, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs with low to moderate risks of bias in comparing antidepressants with placebos as the only intervention in treating adult patients with FGIDs (PROSPERO ID: CRD42015030123). Language was restricted to English or Chinese. Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors, following the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews.
   Results: Of 2,460 records identified, 31 studies reporting on 2,340 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Antidepressants were more effective than placebos in terms of the rate of responder [RR = 1.35 (95% Cl 1.12 to 1.63)], and the reduction of target gastrointestinal symptoms [SMD = -0.94 (95% Cl -1.33 to -0.54)], and disability severity (moderate effect sizes). Those effects partly remained both at the presence and absence of comorbid depression, and among different subtypes of FGIDs. Subgroup analyses confirmed the benefit of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and trazodone. Efficacy of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), low doses of antidepressants, and antidepressants in intermediate to long term treatment was inconclusive due to the scarcity of eligible evidence. Compared to placebo, patients on antidepressants reported more adverse events [RR = 1.91(95% Cl 1.23 to 2.96)] and more frequent withdrawal. On average one in 7.4 (95% Cl 5.4 to 11.9) patients treated with antidepressants responded, while one in 4.8 (95% Cl 3.7 to 6.8) experienced certain adverse effects.
   Conclusions: Antidepressants were inferior to placebo in terms of tolerability and partly superior regarding efficacy. Before prescribing antidepressants, the benefits and side effects should be carefully evaluated.

AB  - Background Compulsory community treatment (CCT) aims to reduce hospital readmissions among people with mental illness. However, research examining the usefulness of CCT is inconclusive. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of CCT in reducing readmission and length of stay in hospital and increasing community service use and treatment adherence.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched three databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Embase) for quantitative studies on CCT published in English between Jan 1, 1806, and Jan 4, 2018. We included both randomised and non-randomised designs that compared CCT with no CCT, and pre-post designs that compared patients before and after CCT. Studies were eligible if they had been peer-reviewed, if 50% or more of patients had severe mental illness, and if CCT was the intervention. Trials in which CCT was used in response to a criminal offence were excluded. We extracted data on study characteristics and length of follow-up, patient-level data on diagnosis, age, sex, race, and admission history, and outcomes of interest (readmission to hospital, inpatient beddays, community service use, and treatment adherence) for meta-analysis, for which we extracted summary estimates. We used a random-effects model to compare disparate outcome measures and convert effect size statistics into standardised mean differences. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018086232.
   Findings Of 1931 studies identified, 41 (2%) met inclusion criteria and had sufficient data for analysis. Before and after CCT comparisons showed significant large effects on readmission to hospital (standardised mean difference 0 . 80, 95% CI 0 . 53-1 . 08; I-2 = 94 . 74), use of community services (0 . 83, 0 . 46-1 . 21; I-2 = 87 . 26), and treatment adherence (2 . 12, 1 . 69-2 . 55; I-2 = 0), and a medium effect on inpatient bed-days (0 . 66, 0 . 46-0 . 85; I-2 = 94 . 12). Contemporaneous controlled comparison studies (randomised and non-randomised) showed no significant effect on readmission, inpatient bed-days, or treatment adherence, but a moderate effect on use of community services (0 . 38, 0 . 19-0 . 58; I (2) = 96 . 92). A high degree of variability in study quality was found, with observational study ratings ranging from three to nine. Bias most frequently centred on poor comparability between CCT and control participants.
   Interpretation We found no consistent evidence that CCT reduces readmission or length of inpatient stay, although it might have some benefit in enforcing use of outpatient treatment or increasing service provision, or both. Future research should focus on why some people do not engage with treatment offered and on enhancing quality of the community care available. Shortcomings of this study include high levels of variability between studies and variation in study quality.Copyright (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Elderly suicide is a rising concern. Despite the advent of mobile technology, there remained a gap in the evidence base as to whether smartphone applications could be used for mindfulness intervention for suicidality in Asian older adults. This paper aimed to review recent research relevant to smartphone applications that could be used in providing mindfulness interventions for suicidality to Asian older adults. The inclusion criteria for this review were papers published in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2018 with the usage of specific search terms, namely, smartphone application', mobile application', and mindfulness', assessed against the inclusion criteria and screened by an experienced Asian clinician to be of clinical utility for mindfulness intervention for suicidality with Asian older adults. Initial search on databases yielded 236 results. A total of 35 full text papers that fit the inclusion criteria were assessed for eligibility and 10 papers were included in the current review. This review highlighted the paucity of rigorous empirically validated research into effective smartphone applications that can be used for mindfulness interventions for suicidality with Asian older adults.

AB  - A deficient serotonergic system is associated with psychopathological behaviors in various species, among which, feather pecking (FP) in chickens. Deficiency in the serotonergic system can predispose birds to develop FP, while the serotonergic system is affected in birds that feather peck. Serotonin (5-HT) can further influence dopamine (DA) activity. Lines with high FP tendency generally have low central 5-HT and DA turnovers at a young age, but high turnovers at an adult age in brain areas involved in somato-motor regulation and goal directed behavior. Agonizing 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors increases FP, while antagonizing D2 receptor reduces FP. Genetic associations exist between FP, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor functioning and metabolism of 5 HT and DA. Birds with deficient functioning of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor and 5-HT metabolism appear predisposed to develop FP. Birds which feather peck often eat feathers, have low whole-blood 5-HT, different gut-microbiota composition and immune competence compared to non-peckers. FP and feather eating likely affect the interaction between gut microbiota, immune system and serotonergic system, but this needs further investigation.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review of the available literature to (1) examine the association between death anxiety and hypochondriasis and (2) examine the association between death anxiety and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS).
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase, PsycINFO, Pubmed and Ovid databases and reference lists of selected articles. Articles were included when the research population concerned people with hypochondriasis and/or MUS in who death anxiety was assessed by a validated research method. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted relevant characteristics and data. The data were descriptively analysed.
   Results: Of the 1087 references identified in the search, six studies on the association between death anxiety and hypochondriasis and three studies on the association between death anxiety and MUS met inclusion criteria. All studies found a positive association of death anxiety with hypochondriasis and/or MUS. The design of all studies was cross-sectional and the overall quality of the studies was low. The influence of age or sex on these associations was not analysed in any of the studies. Given the diversity in setting, population, study design, and methods used, a meta-analysis was not possible.
   Conclusion: All studies found a positive association of death anxiety with hypochondriasis and/or MUS. Acknowledging that death anxiety may play a prominent role in hypochondriasis/MUS populations, future research should address (potentially modifiable) determinants of death anxiety in these populations.

In this review, three clock-related diseases, namely cancer, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and depression, are discussed. Evidence-based mechanisms of action of active compounds, namely epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, and melatonin, from three medicinal plants, Camellia sinensis K., Curcuma longa L., and Hypericum perforatum L., respectively, as potential therapies against cancer, AD, and depression, respectively, have been explained. Feedback loops of basic inputs and application outputs of various studies will lead to the development of chronobiology for applications in time-keeping, disease prevention, and control, and future agricultural practices.

AB  - Background Occupational heat strain (ie, the effect of environmental heat stress on the body) directly threatens workers' ability to live healthy and productive lives. We estimated the effects of occupational heat strain on workers' health and productivity outcomes.
   Methods Following PRISMA guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase from database inception to Feb 5, 2018, for relevant studies in any labour environment and at any level of occupational heat strain. No restrictions on language, workers' health status, or study design were applied. Occupational heat strain was defined using international health and safety guidelines and standards. We excluded studies that calculated effects using simulations or statistical models instead of actual measurements, and any grey literature. Risk of bias, data extraction, and sensitivity analysis were performed by two independent investigators. Six random-effects meta-analyses estimated the prevalence of occupational heat strain, kidney disease or acute kidney injury, productivity loss, core temperature, change in urine specific gravity, and odds of occupational heat strain occurring during or at the end of a work shift in heat stress conditions. The review protocol is available on PROSPERO, registration number CRD42017083271.
   Findings Of 958 reports identified through our systematic search, 111 studies done in 30 countries, including 447 million workers from more than 40 different occupations, were eligible for analysis. Our meta-analyses showed that individuals working a single work shift under heat stress (defined as wet-bulb globe temperature beyond 22.0 or 24.8 degrees C depending on work intensity) were 4.01 times (95% CI 2.45-6.58; nine studies with 11 582 workers) more likely to experience occupational heat strain than an individual working in thermoneutral conditions, while their core temperature was increased by 0.7 degrees C (0.4-1.0; 17 studies with 1090 workers) and their urine specific gravity was increased by 14.5% (0.0031, 0.0014-0.0048; 14 studies with 691 workers). During or at the end of a work shift under heat stress, 35% (31-39; 33 studies with 13 088 workers) of workers experienced occupational heat strain, while 30% (21-39; 11 studies with 8076 workers) reported productivity losses. Finally, 15% (11-19; ten studies with 21 721 workers) of individuals who typically or frequently worked under heat stress (minimum of 6 h per day, 5 days per week, for 2 months of the year) experienced kidney disease or acute kidney injury. Overall, this analysis include a variety of populations, exposures, and occupations to comply with a wider adoption of evidence synthesis, but resulted in large heterogeneity in our meta-analyses. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation analysis revealed moderate confidence for most results and very low confidence in two cases (average core temperature and change in urine specific gravity) due to studies being funded by industry.
   Interpretation Occupational heat strain has important health and productivity outcomes and should be recognised as a public health problem. Concerted international action is needed to mitigate its effects in light of climate change and the anticipated rise in heat stress. Copyright (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It features prominently in all social behavior, is essential for maintaining relationships, and shows pronounced individual differences. Here we review new approaches to study the underlying psychological mechanisms and discuss how they could best be investigated using modern tools from social neuroscience. We list key desiderata for the field, such as validity, specificity, and reproducibility, and link them to specific recommendations for the future. We also discuss new computational modeling approaches, and the application to psychopathology.

AB  - While many consider empathy an exclusively human trait, non-human animals are capable of simple forms of empathy, such as emotional contagion, as well as consolation and helping behavior. Rodent models are particularly useful for describing the neuronal background of these phenomena. They offer the possibility of employing single-cell resolution mapping of the neuronal activity as well as novel techniques for manipulation of in vivo activity, which are currently unavailable in human studies. Here, we review recent developments in the field of rodent empathy research with special emphasis on behavioral paradigms and data on neuronal correlates of emotional contagion. We hope that the use of rodent models will enhance our understanding of social deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized with empathy impairments and the evolutionary continuity of the empathic trait.

AB  - Action is a key channel for interacting with the outer world. As such, the ability to monitor actions and their consequences - regardless as to whether they are self-generated or other-generated - is of crucial importance for adaptive behavior. The medial frontal cortex (MFC) has long been studied as a critical node for performance monitoring in nonsocial contexts. Accumulating evidence suggests that the MFC is involved in a wide range of functions necessary for one's own performance monitoring, including error detection, and monitoring and resolving response conflicts. Recent studies, however, have also pointed to the importance of the MFC in performance monitoring under social conditions, ranging from monitoring and understanding others' actions to reading others' mental states, such as their beliefs and intentions (i.e., mentalizing). Here we review the functional roles of the MFC and related neural networks in performance monitoring in both nonsocial and social contexts, with an emphasis on the emerging field of a social systems neuroscience approach using macaque monkeys as a model system. Future work should determine the way in which the MFC exerts its monitoring function via interactions with other brain regions, such as the superior temporal sulcus in the mentalizing system and the ventral premotor cortex in the mirror system.

AB  - Aim: Epidemiological data have provided evidence that psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) can occur in the general population, not necessarily accompanied by the impairment and suffering observed in formal psychiatric diagnoses. According to the psychosis continuum hypothesis, PLEs would be subject to the same risk factors as frank psychosis. The aim of this review was to summarize observational studies that evaluated cannabis use as a risk factor for PLEs as determined by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences in non-clinical samples. The instrument composed of 3 dimensions-positive, negative and depressive-is a scale specifically designed to assess the occurrence, frequency and impact of PLEs in non-clinical population.
   Methods: We searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and PsycInfo electronic databases for indexed peer-reviewed studies published until September 2017.
   Results: We initially identified 100 articles. The PRISMA model for systematic reviews was used and 19 full-text articles were analysed. In general, the findings suggested that the higher the cannabis use and the younger the participants, the higher the reports of PLEs, although associations were more consistent for the positive dimension.
   Conclusions: More attention should be paid to the understanding of the risk factors of PLEs in the general population, since these experiences are themselves a risk for psychotic disorders.

AB  - The aim of this theoretical study is to learn which cognitive, emotional, attitudinal, and behavioural variables involved in relationships are related to sexist attitudes by adolescents and how they relate to one another. After searching scientific articles published between 2005 and 2018 on PsycINFO, Psicodoc, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, 1,170 studies were obtained. After conducting the selection process, 20 were included in the review. The results of these studies show that adolescents who display attitudes that are more sexist have a more positive attitude towards intimate partner violence, greater sexual risk behaviours, greater attraction to sexist partners, greater support for the myth of idealized love and myth of love-abuse link, greater emotional dependence on the partner, and poorer quality in relationships, revealing gender-based differences in some of the mentioned variables. It is concluded that sexist attitudes are related to harmful forms of intimate interaction among teenagers.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWe review evidence linking PTSD to physical health symptoms and specific disorders, highlighting areas with multiple studies and objective measures of disease states when available. We also examine evidence for biological, behavioral, and psychosocial mechanisms underlying these associations and discuss the clinical implications of recent research.Recent FindingsRecent meta-analyses have found that evidence is particularly strong for increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal disorders among patients with PTSD. Numerous studies have found alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic nervous system, inflammation, and health behaviors that could increase risk of illness, but few studies have simultaneously incorporated measures of mechanisms and disease outcomes.SummaryFuture research should focus on expanding the diversity of populations studied, particularly with respect to underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Longitudinal studies that incorporate repeated measures of PTSD, pathogenic mechanisms of disease, and physical health outcomes and the addition of physical health outcomes to PTSD treatment trials will be most informative for the field.

AB  - A systematic search was carried out in the databases of Pubmed, Indmed and Mausam for articles on the effect of ambient temperature on health. Relevant data were extracted using a standard data abstraction form by two authors independently. The overall effects of ambient air temperature are reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on mortality. Of 812 records identified, only seven were included in the final review as per pre-defined criteria. An increase in the all-cause mortality rate of 41% are reported during a heat wave in India. Risk ratios for all-cause mortality was in the range of 1.7-2.1. The dose-response relationship of ambient temperature and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases are been reported. Current evidence on the effect of ambient temperature and health is sufficient to initiate an integrated response from policy makers, climate scientists and public health practitioners in India. Continued advocacy and generation of more robust evidence is needed.

AB  - The proven effectiveness of neuromodulation and stimulation techniques for the management of psychiatric disorders has brought strongly needed innovation in psychiatry, given the high prevalence and high costs of treatment resistance. Although evidence-based guidelines in neuromodulation have been implemented to improve the clinical efficacy, safety, and research procedures, practical suggestions on how to design a psychiatric neuromodulation unit (PNU) are not available in the scientific literature. In this contribution, we have combined the results of a literature search with the suggestions of clinical psychiatrists, managers, and bioethicists who have had firsthand experience in building a PNU. Eleven key issues concerning the implementation and management of a PNU were identified: general context, team composition, environment, basic technical equipment, clinical versus research activities, target clinical population, education and training, interdisciplinarity, ethical aspects, regulatory and reimbursement issues, fund-raising, and partnership development. Moreover, a business plan comprising pragmatic solutions and recommendations for designing an efficient PNU was laid out.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate effects of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) and OXTR genotype on resting state functional connectivity in the human brain.
   Methods: We searched research databases for peer-reviewed empirical studies. Of 71 unique citations, 18 articles (13 IN-OT, five OXTR) met full inclusion criteria.
   Results: Two studies examined effects on large-scale networks; most examined acute effects on amygdala connectivity with other social and affective regions. OXTR studies identified three polymorphisms (rs2254298, rs2268498, rs53576) having allele- and sex-dependent effects on prefrontal functional connectivity, and additive effects of OXTR risk alleles on reward circuitry. Age, sex, early life stress, and psychopathology emerged as potential moderators of both IN-OT and OXTR effects.
   Discussion: IN-OT appears to modulate resting state functional connectivity in a manner similar to its effects on task fMRI, consistent with hypothesized models of IN-OT. However, conclusions are limited by the narrow range of neuroanatomical seed regions, and methodological and experimental design heterogeneity. Future studies should take into account individual differences. Findings may provide insight into mechanisms through which IN-OT impacts human behavior.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, can acquire various cell phenotypes based on their location and current role. This level of plasticity is required to fulfil the vast variety of functions that microglia perform. Adequate microglial functions are crucial for a healthy brain. However, microglial activation can also contribute to both degenerative/traumatic and proliferative diseases. We review current evidence supporting roles for caspases, a family of proteases, in the overall control of microglia, from the regulation of their activation, their biological functions, to their death. Further, we discuss possible roles for these microglial caspase-dependent signaling pathways in brain diseases.

AB  - Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) is reportedly associated with high mortality from mostly cardiovascular causes in patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Lifestyle interventions augment effectivemanagement of MS in patients with SMD. The present meta-analysis aims at updating the recent evidence on the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention for MS in patients with SMD.
   Method: A literature search for English Language publications of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 2001 to 2016 comparing lifestyle modification (LM) with treatment as usual (TAU) in the management of MS were identified. Using PRISMA guidelines, 19 RCTs reporting data on 1688 SMD and MS patients and providing data on change in Body Weight, BodyMass Index (BMI) andwaist circumference (WC) were included. Using random effects model, standardizedmean difference between LM and TAU for the mean baseline-to-endpoint change in body weight, BMI andWC was calculated with a 95% confidence limit, on RevMan 5.3. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016046847).
   Results: LM had significantly superior efficacy in the reducing weight (-0.64, 95% CI -0.89, -0.39, Z = 5.03, overall effect p b 0.00001), BMI (-0.68, 95% CI -1.01, -0.35, Z = 4.05, overall effect p b 0.0001), and WC (-0.60, 95% CI -1.17, -0.03, Z = 2.06; overall effect p = 0.04), compared to TAU. LM was significantly more effective than TAU even in short duration (p = 0.0001) and irrespective of the treatment setting.
   Conclusion: Interventions targeting LM in persons with SMD and MS are effective in reducing body weight, BMI andWC. It must be routinely recommended to all patientswith SMD, ideally during commencement stage of second generation antipsychotic treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geneticists use olfactory conditioning in Drosophila to identify learning genes; however, little is known about how these genes are integrated into short-term memory (STM) pathways. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the STM evidence base is weak. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the field. Using metrics to quantify variation between discovery articles and follow-up studies, we found that seven genes were both highly replicated, and highly reproducible. However, similar to 80% of STM genes have never been replicated. While only a few studies investigated interactions, the reviewed genes could account for > 1000% memory. This large summed effect size could indicate irreproducibility, many shared pathways, or that current assay protocols lack the specificity needed to identify core plasticity genes. Mechanistic theories of memory will require the convergence of evidence from system, circuit, cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments; systematic data synthesis is an essential tool for integrated neuroscience.

AB  - Background
   Personality disorder is a severe health issue. However, the epidemiology of personality disorders is insufficiently described and surveys report very heterogeneous rates.
   Aims
   We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on the prevalence of personality disorders in adult populations and examine potential moderators that affect heterogeneity.
   Method
   We searched PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and Medline for studies that used standardised diagnostics (DSM-IV/-5, ICD-10) to report prevalence rates of personality disorders in community populations in Western countries. Prevalence rates were extracted and aggregated by random-effects models. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were performed and publication bias was assessed.
   Results
   The final sample comprised ten studies, with a total of 113 998 individuals. Prevalence rates were fairly high for any personality disorder (12.16%; 95% CI, 8.01-17.02%) and similarly high for DSM Clusters A, B and C, between 5.53 (95% CI, 3.20-8.43%) and 7.23% (95% CI, 2.37-14.42%). Prevalence was highest for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (4.32%; 95% CI, 2.16-7.16%) and lowest for dependent personality disorder (0.78%; 95% CI, 0.37-1.32%). A low prevalence was significantly associated with expert-rated assessment (versus self-rated) and reporting of descriptive statistics for antisocial personality disorder.
   Conclusions
   Epidemiological studies on personality disorders in community samples are rare, whereas prevalence rates are fairly high and vary substantially depending on samples and methods. Future studies investigating the epidemiology of personality disorders based on the DSM-5 and ICD-11 and models of personality functioning and traits are needed, and efficient treatment should be a priority for healthcare systems to reduce disease burden.

AB  - When consolidated long-term memories are reactivated they can destabilize, rendering the memory labile and vulnerable to modification. This period of lability is followed by reconsolidation, a process that restabilizes the memory trace. Reactivation-induced memory destabilization is the gateway process to reconsolidation, but research in this area has focused primarily on the mechanisms underlying post-reactivation restabilization. As a result, our understanding of processes subserving destabilization have lagged behind those responsible for reconsolidation. Here we review the literature investigating the neural basis of reactivation-induced memory destabilization. We begin by reviewing memory destabilization broadly and the boundary conditions that influence the likelihood of reactivated memories to destabilize. We then discuss the fact that boundary conditions can be overcome in the presence of novelty, providing evidence for the theory that reconsolidation is a mechanism for memory updating. From here, we delve into a detailed review of the role of classical neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine, in re consolidation, with a focus on their involvement in destabilization. Many of these neurotransmitters appear capable of promoting memory destabilization, and research investigating the cellular pathways through which they influence destabilization is a growing area. However, gaps remain in our understanding of how these neurotransmitters work in conjunction with one another to support destabilization across different types of memory and in different brain regions. Advances in the coming years within this research field should greatly contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that influence the dynamic process of long-term memory storage and modification, information crucial to the development of potential treatments for disorders characterized by strong, maladaptive memories.

AB  - Background Loneliness and social isolation are being increasingly recognized as influencing both physical and mental health. There is limited research carried out with military veterans and, to date, there is no review of existing evidence.
   Aims To synthesize and examine the evidence exploring aspects of social isolation and loneliness of military veterans, using a systematic narrative review strategy.
   Methods A database search was carried out utilizing relevant search criterion. Seven databases were searched for publications with no date restrictions. Articles were included if they involved veterans and either social isolation or loneliness. The initial search returned 484 papers, after exclusions, removal of duplications, and a reference/citation search, 17 papers remained and were included in this review.
   Results The retrieved papers examined four areas of loneliness and social isolation: prevalence of loneliness in the veteran population, experiences related to military service as impacting loneliness or social isolation, the relationship between mental health and loneliness or social isolation, and interventions to combat loneliness and social isolation. Differences between the experiences of younger and older veterans were also highlighted.
   Conclusions It is evident that military veterans present unique experiences of loneliness and social isolation, especially older veterans. This requires specific attention outside of campaigns targeted at the non-military population.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewTo explore the most recent developments in the effective diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Recent FindingsThe clinical diagnosis of NPS in AD is facilitated by the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). CT and MRI scans can be useful for detecting structural changes indicating AD. Other promising diagnostic methodologies that are less frequently used in the clinical setting include positron emission tomography (PET) scans for detecting amyloid and blood tests for detecting serum biomarkers. Numerous pharmaceutical agents have been studied for their use in managing NPS, with antipsychotics being popular for managing agitation but also having significant side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as reminiscence therapy and the Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate (DICE) approach may be able to provide treatment without such adverse effects.SummaryDiagnosing AD and the comorbid NPS remains primarily a clinical endeavor with CT and MRI scans sometimes used, but evidence is amassing for the use of other imaging modalities and different lab tests for convenient and empiric diagnosis of AD to distinguish it from other psychiatric illnesses. The number of pharmacologic treatments for NPS that are safe as well as efficacious remains limited, yet non-pharmacologic interventions have clear clinical utility. In addition to searching for more successful pharmacological treatments, further research should focus on novel diagnostic tests and non-pharmacologic therapies.

AB  - Context: Attention deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed in psychiatric outpatient clinics, is the most common psychiatric disorder among schoolchildren. The purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis on subscales related to ADHD examined on schoolchildren. Moreover, it is tried to evaluate meta-analysis of ADHD and its subscales in primary school students in Iran.
   Evidence Acquisition: Searching through the databases of Magiran, SID, Google Scholar, etc. a total of 16 articles were collected and weighted based on the number of cases and prevalence in binomial distribution. By using a random effects model meta-analysis (I2 = 96.5%), data were analyzed by the use of R and STATA software (version 11.2).
   Results: In this analysis, 27 articles published between the years of 2001 and 2016 were used. The total sample size was 15124 students whose ages ranged from six to 14 years old. The prevalence of ADHD based on parents and teachers' consensus was 12% (CI 95%: 9.0 -15), from parents' perspective 15.6% (CI 95%: 9.8 -21.5), and from teachers' perspective 17.2% (CI 95%: 12.7 -21.8). The subgroups' prevalence rates based on parents and teachers' consensus were as follows: Attention deficit (AD) = 4.2%, hyperactive impulsive (HI) = 4.1%, and combined type (CT) = 3.5%. ADHD was more prevalent in boys than girls (7.9% versus 5.5%).
   Conclusions: The results indicated that the prevalence of ADHD among schoolchildren is moderate; therefore, considering the importance of students' mental health, the needs for identification, prevention, and treatment of high-risk groups by responsible institutions become obvious.

AB  - The perception that anthropogenic stressors cause jellyfish blooms is widespread within the scientific literature and media but robust evidence in support of these claims appears scarce. We used a citation analysis of papers published on "jellyfish blooms" to assess the extent to which such claims are made and the robustness of the evidence cited to support claims. Our search of the Web of Science returned 365 papers on "jellyfish blooms." Each paper was searched for statements linking jellyfish blooms to specific anthropogenic stressors. For each statement we recorded the affirmation afforded to the claim, identified the stressors purported to cause blooms, the sources cited to support the statement, the type of study cited and the species studied in the cited source. Almost half the papers contained statements claiming that blooms were facilitated by anthropogenic stressors but most (70%) afforded a low degree of affirmation to the claim. We identified three major limitations in the evidence cited to support claims: (1) it was dominated by studies of two wide-spread and highly invasive taxa (Aurelia aurita and Mnemiopsis leidyi) that may not represent the responses of jellyfishes more generally; (2) the empirical evidence cited was dominated by correlative studies which, whilst useful for generating hypotheses, cannot attribute causation; and (3) the reviews most commonly-cited as evidence mostly cited circumstantial evidence and other reviews and provided conceptual models of how stressors could influence blooms, rather than robust evidence. We conclude that, although anthropogenic stressors could enhance jellyfish blooms, robust evidence is limited. Claims that strongly affirm anthropogenic stressors as causes of jellyfish blooms appear to be amplifying the evidence beyond that available. As a community we need to qualify the statements we make about jellyfish to strike a better balance between perpetuating perception and accurately portraying the state of knowledge.

After an initial selection of 515 articles, 32 full-text articles were subjected to in-depth analysis leading to the final selection of 18 articles. We used the AAID framework definition of intellectual disability to analyze the dimensions explored by the selected studies and found that the majority of studies focused on the use of technology as supports to instrumental activities of daily life. The ISO classification of assistive products allowed us to identify that many e-health products are aimed at providing psychological or medical treatment. In summary, this review suggests that there is a very small number of studies focusing on the use of technology by older persons with intellectual disabilities. The studies present substantial limitations regarding generalization and replication and pay little attention to the maintenance of cognitive abilities in this population. These aspects, together with premature aging generally associated with many conditions that lead to intellectual disability, underscore the need to pay more attention to and develop e-health interventions for cognitive stimulation for this group.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this methodology paper is to draw on the procedural decisions of a study that used Q-methodology to study older community dwellers facing the largest single urban redevelopment project in Hong Kong, one that involves complex issues and multiple stakeholders.Methodology/approach: This is a methodology paper that is supported by the literature. Q-methodology was a part of the mixed methods study and was followed by focus groups.Result: Findings provided existential understanding of the older community dwellers and the knowledge base for subsequent studies.Discussion: This paper discusses and argues the use of Q-methodology in a community study with older residents. The theoretical and philosophical positions and the methodological implications are outlined. The results can also be transformed into concrete, useful information to inform policymaking.Implications: The application of Q-methodology in a large-scale urban redevelopment project among older community dwellers has been scant. The research, social and practice implication of this paper is to highlight the distinguishing characteristics of the Q-methodology by providing a contextual background and discussing the methodological considerations of the study. The advantages of using Q-methodology in the fieldwork and older adults are identified.Originality/value: Responding to trends in aging and urbanization, two historically significant demographic changes stressed by the World Health Organization and the European Commission, this paper focuses on the procedural decisions of the first study using Q-methodology to study older community dwellers facing the largest urban redevelopment and renewal project in Hong Kong to understand their perceptions and attitudinal patterns.

AB  - Background: Suicide attempts (SA) and other types of self-harm (SH) are strong predictors of death by suicide in adolescents, emphasizing the need to investigate therapeutic interventions in reduction of these and other symptoms. We conducted an updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from our previous study reporting therapeutic interventions that were effective in reducing SH including SA, while additionally exploring reduction of suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms (DS).
   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted across OVIDMedline, psycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from the first available article to October 22nd, 2017, with a primary focus on RCTs evaluating therapeutic interventions in the reduction of self-harm. Search terms included self-injurious behavior; self-mutilation; suicide, attempted; suicide; drug overdose.
   Results: Our search identified 1,348 articles, of which 743 eligible for review, yielding a total of 21 studies which met predetermined inclusion criteria. Eighteen unique therapeutic interventions were identified among all studies, stratified by individual-driven, socially driven, and mixed interventions, of which 5 studies found a significant effect for primary outcomes of self-harm and suicide attempts (31.3%), and 5 studies found a significant effect for secondary outcomes of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms (29.4%) for therapeutic intervention vs. treatment as usual. Collapsing across different variations of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), and classifying Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) as a type of CBT, CBT is the only intervention with replicated positive impact on reducing self-harm in adolescents.
   Conclusion: While the majority of studies were not able to determine efficacy of therapeutic interventions for both primary and secondary outcomes, our systematic review suggests that individual self-driven and socially-driven processes appeared to show the greatest promise for reducing suicide attempts, with benefits of combined self-driven and systems-driven approaches for reducing overall self-harm. Further RCTs of all intervention categories are needed to address the clinical and etiological heterogeneity of suicidal behavior in adolescents, specifically suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms.

AB  - Regulation of exo- and endocytosis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) plays a critical role in the expression of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at excitatory central synapses. Enhanced AMPAR exocytosis or endocytosis has been suggested to contribute to LTP or LTD, respectively. However, several unsettled fundamental questions have remained about AMPAR exo- and endocytosis in the basal condition and during synaptic plasticity: (1) Does the size of each exo- or endocytosis event, and/or do the frequencies of these events change during LTP or LTD? If they change, what are the time courses of the respective changes? (2) Where does the exo- or endocytosis preferentially occur in each condition: inside or in the vicinity of postsynaptic membrane, or in the extrasynaptic membrane? (3) Do different types of AMPAR, such as GluA1 homo-tetramer, GluA1/2 hetero-tetramer and GluA2/3 hetero-tetramer, show distinct exo- and endocytosis changes? To address these questions, we developed new methods to observe individual events of AMPAR exo-or endocytosis with a high signal to noise (SN) ratio in a culture preparation using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). In these studies, hippocampal neurons were cultured on a neurexin (NRX)-coated glass coverslip, which induced formation of postsynaptic-like membrane (PSLM) directly on the glass surface. Then, a super-ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)-tagged AMPAR subunit such as GluA1 (GluA1-SEP) was expressed in neurons and its fluorescence changes during LTP induced by high frequency electrical field stimulation were observed with TIRFM, which showed different time courses of exocytosis changes of GluA1-, GluA2-, or GluA3-SEP in and around PSLM. In addition, a new method to detect individual endocytosis events of AMPAR was developed by combining TIFRM observation of GluA-SEP around PSLM with a rapid extracellular pH exchange method using a U-tube. Recent results on exoand endocytosis changes of GluA-SEP during N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced LTD suggested that suppression of AMPAR exocytosis rather than enhancement of AMPAR endocytosis primarily contributes to LTD expression, although the NMDA application transiently enhances clathrin-dependent endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPAR.

AB  - Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) must receive early interventions to prevent mental health deterioration or relapse. Telecommunications and other technologies are increasingly being used to assist in health care delivery using "telehealth," which includes telephones and mobile phones, computers, remote sensors, the internet, and other devices, to provide immediate real-time information to service users to improve the management of chronic health conditions. Some initial findings have suggested that technology could improve the quality of life of people with SMI.
   Objective: In this systematic review, we aimed to identify the various uses and efficacy of telehealth technology for SMI.
   Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 2016 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Health Technology Assessment, CINAHL Plus, and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating telehealth for adults with SMI published in English. Additional literature was identified through searching reference lists of key articles. The articles meeting the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed and assessed for quality and risk of bias.
   Results: Our search identified 31 articles describing 29 trials as eligible for the review. The included studies evaluated the use of computers to deliver cognitive rehabilitation (15 trials), patient education (3 trials), and Web-based self-management interventions (2 trials) and to support consultations (1 trial). Virtual reality was used to simulate work and social situations (2 trials) and to deliver cognitive training (1 trial). Telephones were used to prompt service users to take medications (3 trials) and to report symptoms to their health care team (1 trial). Remote sensors were used to monitor medication use (1 trial). Telephone support was found effective in improving medication adherence and reducing the severity of symptoms and inpatient days. Computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation was effective in improving cognitive function. The impact of telehealth on other outcomes was inconsistent. The results of this review should be taken in the context of varied quality in study design, with only 5 studies demonstrating a low risk of bias.
   Conclusions: A growing variety of telehealth technologies are being used to support the management of SMI. Specific technology types have been found to be effective for some outcomes (eg, telephone and remote medication monitoring for adherence to treatment), while other types of telehealth technologies (eg, delivery of patient education using computers) had no benefit over traditional nurse-based methods and were less acceptable to patients. Further research is warranted to establish the full potential benefits of telehealth for improving the quality of life in people with SMI, acceptability from the service user perspective, and cost-effectiveness. The findings of this review are limited by the poor quality of many of the studies reviewed.

AB  - The current generation of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lacks a mechanistic representation of vegetation responses to soil drought, impairing their ability to accurately predict Earth system responses to future climate scenarios and climatic anomalies, such as El Nino events. We propose a simple numerical approach to model plant responses to drought coupling stomatal optimality theory and plant hydraulics that can be used in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The model is validated against stand-scale forest transpiration (E) observations from a long-term soil drought experiment and used to predict the response of three Amazonian forest sites to climatic anomalies during the twentieth century. We show that our stomatal optimization model produces realistic stomatal responses to environmental conditions and can accurately simulate how tropical forest E responds to seasonal, and even long-term soil drought. Our model predicts a stronger cumulative effect of climatic anomalies in Amazon forest sites exposed to soil drought during El Nino years than can be captured by alternative empirical drought representation schemes. The contrasting responses between our model and empirical drought factors highlight the utility of hydraulically-based stomatal optimization models to represent vegetation responses to drought and climatic anomalies in DGVMs.

AB  - Remembering to perform a behaviour in the future, prospective memory, is essential to ensuring that people fulfil their intentions. Prospective memory involves committing to memory a cue to action (encoding), and later recognising and acting upon the cue in the environment (retrieval). Prospective memory performance is believed to be influenced by the emotionality of the cues, however the literature is fragmented and inconsistent. We conducted a systematic search to synthesise research on the influence of emotion on prospective memory. Sixty-seven effect sizes were extracted from 17 articles and hypothesised effects tested using three meta-analyses. Overall, prospective memory was enhanced when positively-valenced rather than neutral cues were presented (d = 0.32). In contrast, negatively-valenced cues did not enhance prospective memory overall (d = 0.07), but this effect was moderated by the timing of the emotional manipulation. Prospective memory performance was improved when negatively-valenced cues were presented during both encoding and retrieval (d = 0.40), but undermined when presented only during encoding (d = -0.25). Moderating effects were also found for cue-focality and whether studies controlled for the arousal level of the cues. The principal finding is that positively-valenced cues improve prospective memory performance and that timing of the manipulation can moderate emotional effects on prospective memory. We offer a new agenda for future empirical work and theorising in this area.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and other similar dementias are debilitating neurodegenerative disorders whose etiology and pathogenesis remain largely unknown, even after decades of research. With the anticipated increase in prevalence of Alzheimer's type dementias among the more susceptible aging population, the need for disease-modifying treatments is urgent. While various hypotheses have been put forward over the last few decades, we suggest that Alzheimer's type dementias are triggered by external environmental factors, co-expressing in individuals with specific genetic susceptibilities. These external stressors are defined in the Iron Dysregulation and Dormant Microbes (IDDM) hypothesis, previously put forward. This hypothesis is consistent with current literature in which serum ferritin levels of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are significantly higher compared those of age- and gender-matched controls. While iron dysregulation contributes to oxidative stress, it also causes microbial reactivation and virulence of the so-called dormant blood (and tissue) microbiome. Dysbiosis (changes in the microbiome) or previous infections can contribute to the dormant blood microbiome (atopobiosis(1)), and also directly promotes systemic inflammation via the amyloidogenic formation and shedding of potent inflammagens such as lipopolysaccharides. The simultaneous iron dysregulation and microbial aberrations affect the hematological system, promoting fibrin amylodiogenesis, and pathological clotting. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress can contribute to blood brain barrier permeability and the ensuing neuro-inflammation, characteristic of Alzheimer's type dementias. While large inter-individual variability exists, especially concerning disease pathogenesis, the IDDM hypothesis acknowledges primary causative factors which can be targeted for early diagnosis and/or for prevention of disease progression.

AB  - Background: Despite several attempts to review and explain how meditation alters the brain and facilitates emotion regulation, the extent to which meditation and emotion regulation strategies share the same neural mechanisms remains unclear.
   Objective: We aim to understand the influence of meditation on the neural processing of negative emotional stimuli in participants who underwent meditation interventions (naive meditators) and long-term meditators.
   Methodology: A systematic review was conducted using standardized search operators that included the presence of terms related to emotion, meditation and neuro-imaging techniques in PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.
   Results: Searches identified 882 papers, of which 11 were eligible for inclusion. Results showed a predominance of greater prefrontal/frontal activity related to meditation, which might indicate the increased recruitment of cognitive/attentional control resources in naive and long-term meditators. This increased frontal activity was also observed when participants were asked to simply react to negative stimuli. Findings fromemotion-related areas were scarce but suggested increased insular activity in meditators, potentially indicating that meditation might be associated with greater bodily awareness.
   Conclusions: Meditation practice prompts regulatory mechanisms when participants face aversive stimuli, even without an explicit request. Moreover, some studies reported increased insular activity in meditators, consistent with the hypothesis that meditation helps foster an interoceptive awareness of bodily and emotional states.

AB  - In policy-making and research alike, environmental sounds are often considered only as psychophysical stressors, leading to adverse health effects. The soundscape approach, on the other hand, aims to extend the scope of sound-related research to consider sounds as resources, promoting healthy and supportive environments. The ISO 12913-1 standard defined soundscapes as acoustic environments "as perceived by people, in context.' The aim of this study was assessing associations between positive soundscapes (e.g., pleasant, calm, less annoying) and positive health-related effects (e.g., increased restoration, reduced stress-inducing mechanisms, etc.). Studies collecting data about individual responses to urban acoustic environments, and individual responses on psychophysical well-being were selected, looking at cases where positive effects were observed. The Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases were searched for peer-reviewed journal papers published in English between 1 January 1991 and 31 May 2018, with combinations of the keywords "soundscape" and at least one among "health", "well-being" or "quality of life." An additional manual search was performed on the reference lists of the retrieved items. Inclusion criteria were: (1) including at least one measure of soundscape dimensions as per the ISO 12913-1 definition; (2) including at least one health-related measure (either physiological or psychological); (3) observing/discussing a "positive" effect of the soundscape on the health-related outcome. The search returned 130 results; after removing duplicates, two authors screened titles and abstracts and selected 19 papers for further analysis. Seven studies were eventually included, with 2783 participants in total. Each study included at least a valence-related soundscape measure. Regarding the health-related measures, four studies included physiological monitoring and the remaining three included self-reported psychological measures. Positive soundscapes were associated with faster stress-recovery processes in laboratory experiments, and better self-reported health conditions in large-scale surveys. Due to the limited number of items and differences in measures across studies, no statistical analysis was performed, and a qualitative approach to data synthesis was sought. Results support the claim that, in contrast with looking at noise only as an environmental stressor, sound perception can act as an enhancer of the human experience in the urban realm, from a health-related point of view.

AB  - What is the evidence that pro re nata' (PRN) medication is effective for ending agitated outbursts in children and adolescents in psychiatric emergency rooms or inpatient units? Literature search was performed for studies of PRN medication use in children and adolescents that included an outcome measure. One randomised controlled trial, three prospective studies and six retrospective studies that included some outcome measure were identified. Outcome measures were heterogeneous, and frequently did not use standardised metrics assessing agitation level to measure effectiveness. The single small Randomized Controlled Trial (RTC) does not find a difference between placebo and medication, and outcomes of other studies do not control for potential placebo effect of the intervention itself as opposed to the medication. There is insufficient evidence to support the common practice of PRN medications for the management of acute agitation, and no data with which to inform clinical practice, such as which medicines and doses are helpful for specific populations or situations. Psychiatrists have no evidence-based medication interventions for acutely managing agitated outbursts in children and adolescents.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of glucose in the blood. The chronic hyperglycemic state accounts for most of the vascular complications associated to the disease and the prevalent mechanism proposed is related to the glycating chemistry mediated by methylglyoxal (MG), which accumulates in T2DM. In recent years, a higher risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) onset in people affected by T2DM has become evident, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between T2DM and PD are still unknown. The oxidative chemistry of dopamine and its reactivity towards the protein -Synuclein (aS) has been associated to the pathogenesis of PD. Recently, aS has also been described to interact with MG. Interestingly, MG and the dopamine oxidation products share both structural similarity and chemical reactivity. The ability of MG to spread over the site of its production and react with aS could represent the rationale to explain the higher incidence of PD in T2DM-affected people and may open opportunities for the development of novel strategies to antagonize the raise of PD.

AB  - Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is known to cause neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSLE). While not formally recognized as a syndrome associated with NPSLE, catatonia has frequently been reported. Objective: It is important for clinicians to recognize and treat catatonia as a potential manifestation of NPSLE. We present 2 cases of SLE with catatonia and review the cases reported in the literature. Methods: We performed a PubMed search for reported cases of catatonia in SLE. Case reports that met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th ed. diagnostic criteria for catatonia were summarized to assess common diagnostic tests and treatments. Results: Twenty-six articles describing a total of 35 patients (all female), in addition to our 2 patients, were included in the report. All but one of the patients received immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of SLE. To treat catatonia symptoms, 81% of the patients received benzodiazepines, and 38% received electroconvulsive therapy. Conclusions: Catatonia can be a manifestation of NPSLE, particularly in the presence of serologies and symptoms indicative of an active lupus flare. Management of catatonia involves management of the underlying condition, in this case immunomodulatory treatments for NPSLE; avoidance of treatments, such as antipsychotics, which can worsen catatonia; and symptomatic treatments for catatonia, for which benzodiazepines are a first-line treatment, and electroconvulsive therapy when catatonia is refractory to benzodiazepines.

AB  - Background. Tenancy sustainment-maintenance of a tenancy to avoid a premature end of tenure-is fundamental to prevention of homelessness. Understanding what enables a successful tenancy is essential in informing interventions designed to support people in leaving homelessness.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review identifying determinants associated with tenancy sustainment following homelessness.
   Search Methods. A detailed search of 12 electronic databases, as well as gray literature sources, was conducted in 2015 and updated in 2016.
   Selection Criteria. We included all study designs with a population of homeless or formerly homeless individuals in which tenancy sustainment was the primary outcome. Two reviewers independently carried out abstract and full-text reviews. QualSyst, a validated quality appraisal tool, was used in assessing the methodological quality of articles.
   Data Collection and Analysis. A data extraction form was developed for the review and was completed by a pair of reviewers to ensure accuracy. The heterogeneity of the studies included indicated that a narrative overview of the results was most appropriate.
   Main Results. Forty-three articles reporting 38 studies were included. Determinants were categorized at 4 levels: individual, interpersonal, community, and structural. Participation in specific programs (e.g., Housing First), receipt of social support, and older age were identified as positive determinants of tenancy sustainment.
   Conclusions. This systematic review is the first, to our knowledge, to focus solely on tenancy sustainment as a primary outcome. Although a range of determinants associated with tenancy sustainment were identified, it was difficult to draw strong conclusions owing to the heterogeneity of the studies. Despite being a fundamental concept in homelessness research, tenancy sustainment is poorly defined and conceptualized. A deeper understanding of tenancy sustainment will inform the development and evaluation of interventions that support people in leaving homelessness and maintaining tenancies.
   Public Health Implications. Housing stability is central to preventing homelessness and addressing the numerous public health concerns that can co-occur with homelessness. Our review highlights that a standardized approach to measuring housing stability and more high-quality intervention studies are essential.

The aim of present review is to summarize the literature on the effects of lead exposure on respiratory, neurologic, digestive, cardiovascular and urinary disorders and the role of inflammation as an underlying mechanism for these effects.
   Various databases such as ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Iran Medex, were searched from 1970 to November 2017 to gather the required articles using appropriate keywords such as lead, respiratory disorders, neurologic disorders, digestive disorders, cardiovascular disorders, urinary disorders and inflammation.
   Disorders of various body systems and the role of inflammation due to lead exposure has been proven by various studies. These studies indicate that lead exposure may cause respiratory, neurologic, digestive, cardiovascular and urinary diseases. The results were also indicated the increased inflammatory cells and mediators due to lead exposure including cytokines and chemokines due to lead exposure which suggested to be the cause various organ disorders.

AB  - Pesticides, in particular insecticides, can be very beneficial but have also been found to have harmful side effects on non-target insects. Butterflies play an important role in ecosystems, are well monitored and are recognised as good indicators of environmental health. The amount of information already known about butterfly ecology and the increased availability of genomes make them a very valuable model for the study of non-target effects of pesticide usage. The effects of pesticides are not simply linear, but complex through their interactions with a large variety of biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, these effects manifest themselves at a variety of levels, from the molecular to metapopulation level. Research should therefore aim to dissect these complex effects at a number of levels, but as we discuss in this review, this is seldom if ever done in butterflies. We suggest that in order dissect the complex effects of pesticides on butterflies we need to integrate detailed molecular studies, including characterising sequence variability of relevant target genes, with more classical evolutionary ecology; from direct toxicity tests on individual larvae in the laboratory to field studies that consider the potentiation of pesticides by ecologically relevant environmental biotic and abiotic stressors. Such integration would better inform population-level responses across broad geographical scales and provide more in-depth information about the non-target impacts of pesticides.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are frequently observed in major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as impaired long-term psychosocial functioning. However, the relationship between cognitive deficits and psychosocial functioning in MDD is under-investigated. We aim to systematically review the literature on the relationship between specific cognitive impairments and psychosocial functioning in MDD. We systematically reviewed English-language literature in PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus and Web of Science using search terms related to psychosocial functioning. Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists. Following our inclusion/exclusion criteria, 28 studies were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included age (> 18), MDD diagnosed by standard tools (e.g., DSM-IV), use of cognitive and psychosocial assessments. Cross-sectional studies indicated that cognitive deficits in domains of executive functioning, attention, memory, and global cognition are associated with psychosocial dysfunction in domains of as quality of life, and social, occupational, and global functioning. The cognition-functioning relationship was also observed in longitudinal studies, showing that only specific cognitive domains affected psychosocial outcomes over the long-term course of illness. Older age and greater MDD symptom severity appear to enhance cognition-psychosocial dysfunction relationship, however little is known regarding the role of a number of other clinical factors (e.g., psychosis, illness duration).

AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review evaluates current literature on anti-convulsants to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS).
   METHODS: We performed a literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through September 30, 2016. The search was not restricted by patients' age. Articles published in English or with official English translations were included.
   RESULTS: We found 16 double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of anticonvulsants as treatment of AWS. Available data indicates that anticonvulsants are as effective as sedatives/hypnotics in treating mild or moderate AWS. Two studies evaluated the use of anticonvulsants as adjuncts. Combining anticonvulsants with sedatives decreases the quantity of sedatives required and AWS may resolve quicker. There is some data that anticonvulsants can be used to treat AWS as monotherapy. Fourteen of these studies assessed adverse effects of these medications; 13 studies identified minor adverse effects and one found the adverse effects to be intolerable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence indicates that anticonvulsants have good efficacy as monotherapy and as adjuncts with sedatives/hypnotics in treating mild to moderate AWS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cariprazine was approved for treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and currently is being evaluated for treating depression in clinical trials in the United States. We systematically reviewed the literature on the efficacy and safety of cariprazine.
   METHODS: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through August 31, 2016. The search was not restricted by patient age. Articles published in English or official English translations were included.
   RESULTS: Eleven articles that evaluated the use of cariprazine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders were identified. Four trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials evaluated its use in the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Two studies used risperidone or aripiprazole as comparators. Both low- and high-dose cariprazine were more effective than placebo in the treatment of acute mania, mixed episodes, and acute psychosis. Additionally, cariprazine showed efficacy as an adjunctive treatment for depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our review indicates that cariprazine demonstrates superior efficacy and good tolerability, both at low and high doses, in the treatment of individuals with psychosis, mania, and depression.

AB  - This study aims to analyze intimate partner violence from the gender symmetry and asymmetry concepts. Seventy-nine papers were selected for analysis, and most were published in the 2006-2014 period (78.5%). The fields of journals that addressed the subject were psychology (32.9%) followed by public health (27.9%) and nursing (27.6%). Of the researchers, 46.8% work with the feminist theoretical line discourse, whose gender approach is asymmetrical. They mostly produce qualitative research with a sample consisting of women only (81.1%), and 78.3% collected data from violence victims' support services. When looking at the characteristics of the studies conducted by researchers from the theoretical line of family sociologists who advocate gender symmetry (25.3%), qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in similar proportions. Bidirectional violence was identified in 80% of this research. We noted a strong leadership of the feminist theoretical line, which was identified in the discourses of the researchers. We stress the relevance of the discussion of the data with different theoretical frameworks, since analysis in isolation, regardless of the field, runs the risk of being biased and thus weaken the results.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive deficit and behavioural disturbances. Apathy seems to be related to cognitive impairment, but some studies failed to confirm the relationship due to different methodological procedures across studies. A meta-analysis on 8 studies was performed to explore the cognitive correlates of apathy without depression and dementia (pure apathy). Global cognitive function, memory, executive functions, processing speed/attention/working memory, visuospatial abilities and language were the outcomes. The effect size of the relationship between "pure apathy" and reduced global cognitive functioning, executive functions, processing speed/attention/working memory, visuospatial functions, long-term verbal memory was moderate, whereas apathy was strongly associated with inhibition dysfunctioning.
   Our results revealed a strong association between "pure apathy" and cognitive dysfunctions, particularly deficit of memory and executive functions related to altered prefronto-subcortical circuitries.

AB  - In this article, we review the available evidence and explore the association between air pollution and insulin resistance (IR) using meta-analytic techniques. Cohort studies published before January 2018 were selected through English-language literature searches in nine databases. Six cohort studies were included in our sample, which assessed air pollutants including PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m), NO2(nitrogen dioxide), and PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m). Percentage change in insulin or insulin resistance associated with air pollutants with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the risk. A pooled effect (percentage change) was observed, with a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in NO2 associated with a significant 1.25% change (95% CI: 0.67, 1.84; I-2 = 0.00%, p = 0.07) in the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and a 0.60% change (95% CI: 0.17, 1.03; I-2 = 30.94%, p = 0.27) in insulin. Similar to the analysis of NO2, a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 was associated with a significant 2.77% change (95% CI: 0.67, 4.87; I-2 = 94.98%, p < 0.0001) in HOMA-IR and a 2.75% change in insulin (95% CI: 0.45, 5.04; I-2 = 58.66%, p = 0.057). No significant associations were found between PM2.5 and insulin resistance biomarkers. We conclude that increased exposure to air pollution can lead to insulin resistance, further leading to diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases. Clinicians should consider the environmental exposure of patients when making screening and treatment decisions for them.

AB  - Introduction There is increasing interest in the transferability of parenting interventions from high-income countries (HICs) to low-income countries (LICs) in order to improve child development and health outcomes. This is based on the premise that associations between parenting practices and child outcomes are similar in both settings. Many parenting interventions in HICs are evidence-based, but less evidence exists on associations of parenting practices with child outcomes in LICs, in particular, sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. This review synthesises evidence on the association of parenting practices with child outcomes in SSA in order to compare findings with those from HICs.
   Methods We searched electronic databases-Web of Science, ASSIA, Embase, IBSS and PsycINFO-to identify studies from SSA that reported quantitative associations between parenting practices and child health or psychosocial outcomes (eg, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), mental health, conduct disorders). Due to inconsistent conceptual framing of parenting across studies, we used a modified version of the international WHO classification of parenting dimensions to guide synthesis of the results.
   Results Forty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. They were conducted in 13 SSA countries and included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and were predominantly descriptive studies rather than intervention research. Synthesis of results showed that associations between patterns of parenting ('positive'/` harsh') and child outcomes (including SRH, mental health and conduct disorders) in studies from SSA were broadly similar to those found in HICs.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that the impacts of parenting practices on child outcomes are similar across contrasting global regions and, therefore, parenting interventions from HICs might be successfully transferred to SSA, subject to appropriate adaptation. However, this review also highlights the paucity of evidence in this area and the urgent need for higher quality studies to confirm these findings to help develop effective parenting interventions in SSA.

AB  - Background: Physician satisfaction is a multidimensional concept related to many factors. Despite the wide range of research regarding factors affecting physician satisfaction in different European countries, there is a lack of literature reviews analyzing and summarizing current evidence. The aim of the article is to synthetize the literature studying the factors associated with physician satisfaction. Methods: We searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 to January 2017. The eligibility criteria included: (1) target population: physicians working in European hospitals; (2) quantitative research aimed at assessing physician satisfaction and associated factors; (3) use of validated tools. We performed a narrative synthesis. Results: After screening 8585 records, 368 full text articles were independently checked and finally 24 studies were included for qualitative analysis. The included studies surveyed 20,000 doctors from 12 European countries. The tools and scales used in the analyzed research to measure physician satisfaction varied to a large extent. We extracted all pre-specified factors, reported as statistically significant/non-significant. Analyzed factors were divided into three groups: personal, intrinsic and contextual factors. The majority of factors are modifiable and positively associated with characteristics of contextual factors, such as work-place setting/work environment. In the group of work-place related factors, quality of management/leadership, opportunity for professional development and colleague support have been deemed statistically significant in numerous studies. Conclusions: We identified more studies appraising the effect of contextual factors (such as work environment, work-place characteristics), highlighting a positive association between those factors and physician satisfaction, compared with personal and intrinsic factors. Numerous studies confirmed statistically significant associations between physician satisfaction and quality of management, professional development and colleague support/team climate. Due to the health workforce crisis, knowledge regarding physician satisfaction and associated factors is essential to healthcare managers and policy makers for more stable human resources management.

AB  - The neurobiology of stress is studied through behavioral neuroscience, endocrinology, neuronal morphology and neurophysiology. There is a shift in focus toward progressive changes throughout stress paradigms and individual susceptibility to stress that requires methods that allow for longitudinal study design and study of individual differences in stress response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the advantages of noninvasiveness and a large field of view, can be used for functionally mapping brain-wide regions and circuits critical to the stress response, making it suitable for longitudinal studies and understanding individual variability of short-term and long-term consequences of stress exposure. In addition, fMRI can be applied to both animals and humans, which is highly valuable in translating findings across species and examining whether the physiology and neural circuits involved in the stress response are conserved in mammals. However, compared to human fMRI studies, there are a number of factors that are essential for the success of fMRI studies in animals. This review discussed the use of fMRI in animal studies of stress. It reviewed advantages, challenges and technical considerations of the animal fMRI methodology as well as recent literature of stress studies using fMRI in animals. It also highlighted the development of combining fMRI with other methods and the future potential of fMRI in animal studies of stress. We conclude that animal fMRI studies, with their flexibility, low cost and short time frame compared to human studies, are crucial to advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of stress.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology.
   Objectives: We aim to systematically review studies on exposure to long working hours (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours on alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework.
   Data sources: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts.
   Study eligibility and criteria: We will include working-age (>= 15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but exclude children (< 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of exposure to long working hours (i.e., 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level of exposure to long working hours on total amount of alcohol consumed and on the incidence of, prevalence of or mortality from alcohol use disorders, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e., worked 35-40 h/week).
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

AB  - Purpose of review Over the past 10 years, the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has increased in regard to the treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ICT support mechanisms (e.g. computers, laptops, robots) are particularly attractive and are adapted to children with ASD. In addition, ICT algorithms can offer new perspectives for clinicians, outside direct apps or gaming proposals. Here, we will focus on the use of serious games and robots because of their attractiveness and their value in working on social skills. Recent findings The latest knowledge regarding the use of ICT in the forms of serious games and robotics applied to individuals with ASD shows that the field of serious games has already achieved interesting and promising results, although the clinical validations are not always complete. In the field of robotics, there are still many limitations on the use of ICT (e.g. most interaction are similar to the wizard of Oz), and questions remain concerning their eventual effectiveness. To describe the implications of the findings for clinical practice or research, we describe two large projects, namely, JEMImE and Michelangelo, as examples of current studies that are aimed at enhancing social skills in children with ASD by including novel algorithms with clinical insights in robots or serious games.

AB  - Background. Because Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience high rates of both HIV and incarceration relative to other groups, the various stages of criminal justice involvement may serve as important intervention points for addressing HIV and related conditions in this group. Although systematic reviews of HIV interventions targeting MSM in general and BMSM in particular exist, no review has explored the range and impact of HIV, sexually transmitted infection (STI), and substance use prevention and care continuum interventions focused on criminal justice-involved (CJI) populations.
   Objectives. To describe the range and impact of published HIV, STI, and related substance use interventions for US-based CJI populations and to understand their relevance for BMSM.
   Search Methods. We conducted systematic searches in the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, covering the period preceding December 1, 2016.
   Selection Criteria. We selected articles in scientific publications involving quantitative findings for studies of US-based interventions that focused on CJI individuals, with outcomes related to sexual or substance use risk behaviors, HIV, or STIs. We excluded studies if they provided no demographic information, had minimal representation of the population of interest (<30 African American or Black male or transgender participants), had study populations limited to those aged younger than 18 years, or were limited to evaluations of preexisting programs.
   Data Collection and Analysis. We abstracted data from these articles on study design; years covered; study location; participant number, demographics, and sexual orientation (if available); criminal justice setting or type; health condition; targeted outcomes; and key findings. We scored studies by using the Downs and Black quality and bias assessment. We conducted linear regression to examine changes in study quality by publication year.
   Main Results. Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria, including 8 (13.8%) modeling or cost-effectiveness studies and 13 (22.4%) randomized controlled trials. Just 3 studies (5.2%) focused on sexual or gender minorities, with only 1 focused on BMSM. Inmost studies (n=36; 62.1%), however, more than 50% of participants were Black. The most common intervention addressed screening, including 20 empirical studies and 7 modeling studies. Education-focused interventions were also common (n=15) and usually employed didactic rather than skill-building approaches. They were more likely to demonstrate increases in HIV testing, knowledge, and condom-use intentions than reductions in sex-and drug-risk behaviors. Screening programs consistently indicated cost-effectiveness, including with BMSM. Care continuum interventions for people living with HIV showed mixed results; just 3 involved randomized controlled trials, and these interventions did not show significant differences compared with control conditions. A minority of programs targeted non-custody-based CJI populations, despite their constituting a majority of the CJI population at any given time.
   Authors' Conclusions. Screening CJI populations for HIV and other STIs is effective and cost-efficient and holds promise for reducing HIV in BMSM. Education-based and care provision interventions also hold promise for addressing HIV, STIs, mental health, and substance use in CJI populations. Additional empirical and modeling studies and results specific to sexual minorities are needed; their paucity represents a disparity in how HIV is addressed.
   Public Health Implications. HIV and STI screening programs focused on CJI populations should be a priority for reducing HIV risk and numbers of undiagnosed infections among BMSM. Funding agencies and public health leaders should prioritize research to improve the knowledge base regarding which care continuum intervention approaches are most effective for BMSM with criminal justice involvement. Developments in modeling approaches could allow researchers to simulate the impacts and costs of criminal justice involvement-related interventions that might otherwise be cost, time, or ethically prohibitive to study empirically.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex process of recovering the forms and functions of injured tissues. The process is tightly regulated by multiple growth factors and cytokines released at the wound site. Any alterations that disrupt the healing processes would worsen the tissue damage and prolong repair process. Various conditions may contribute to impaired wound healing, including infections, underlying diseases and medications. Numerous studies on the potential of natural products with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and pro-collagen synthesis properties as wound healing agents have been performed. Their medicinal properties can be contributed by the content of bioactive phytochemical constituents such as alkaloids, essential oils, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and phenolic compounds in the natural products. This review highlights the in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies on wound healing promotions by the selected natural products and the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Morita therapy is a systematic psychological therapy that aims to improve everyday functioning rather than target specific symptoms. However, there has been no systematic review evaluating the evidence of the effectiveness of Morita therapy in the treatment of depression. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of Morita therapy in combination with pharmacotherapy in patients 18 and older who were diagnosed with current depressive disorder. A total of 840 patients with depression from 11 randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies were included in this meta-analysis after a literature search of 10 databases was performed from database inception to July 1,2017. All the eligible studies were determined to have an unclear or high risk of bias. Morita therapy plus pharmacotherapy was significantly superior to pharmacotherapy alone in reducing depression severity. The remission rate of the Morita therapy plus pharmacotherapy group was better than that of the pharmacotherapy alone group. Morita therapy significantly reduced depression severity symptoms and improved the remission rate. Due to the relatively weak quality of the included studies, definitive conclusions cannot be made. Thus, multi-center, well-designed clinical trials with larger cohorts are urgently needed to support the clinical application of Morita therapy.

AB  - Background: Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most widely used phthalate, has recently been associated with neurodevelopmental disturbances in children. However, the risk is yet to be quantified. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the association between exposure to DEHP and neurodevelopmental outcomes is necessary, with particular attention to study design (longitudinal vs. cross-sectional).
   Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for associations between exposure to DEHP and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Among 106 published studies found in public databases, eight longitudinal studies and two cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis.
   Results: We observed a statistically significant association between the concentrations of DEHP metabolites and the neurodevelopment outcomes of children among cross-sectional results, and found significant association between DEHP exposure measured in prenatal period and the psychomotor development outcomes measured later in childhood.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of studies investigating the association between DEHP exposure and neurodevelopment in children. A need exists for more researches and a precautionary policy for potential health hazard of DEHP, the most commonly used phthalate, to promote healthier neurodevelopment in children.

AB  - The world is entering a new era of exploring and exploiting the deep-underground space. With humans poised to reach historical depths in the use of the deep Earth, it is essential to understand the effect of the deep-underground environment on the health of humans and other living organisms. This article outlines the history and development of biological research conducted in deep-underground laboratories and provides insight into future areas of investigation. Many deep-underground laboratories have investigated the effects of reduced cosmic ray muons flux, searching for rare events such as proton decay, dark matter particles, or neutrino interactions, but few have focused on the influence of the environmental factors in the deep-underground on living organisms. Some studies revealed that prokaryote and eukaryote cells maintained in low levels of background radiation exhibited an stress response, which manifested as changes in cell growth, enzyme activity, and sensitivity to factors that cause genetic damage; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. There remains an urgent need to understand the detrimental and beneficial biological effects of low background radiation and other factors in the deep-underground on humans and other organisms. Consequently, a multidisciplinary approach to medical research in the deep-underground has been proposed, creating a new discipline, deep-underground medicine, and representing a historical milestone for exploring the deep Earth and in medical research.

AB  - Background The issue of employee fatigue is becoming increasingly prominent, particularly in safety-critical industries.
   Aims To produce an in-depth review collating the known psychological and physiological health and work effects of fatigue to guide mitigation strategies in safety-critical industries.
   Methods Literature searches were conducted via scientific databases using appropriate filters and keywords. The available results were collated into a review and commentary.
   Results Decreased sleep duration and chronodisruption have been shown to cause both significant morbidity and mortality. There is a large body of evidence showing strong associations between fatigue, reduced cognition and occupational accidents, as well as increased metabolic and reproductive health sequelae, some forms of cancer and mortality. Additional evidence links fatigue with mental, gastrointestinal, neurological and chronic pain sequelae.
   Conclusions Fatigue risk mitigation strategies should be implemented, not only to reduce these short-and long-term health risks in employees of safety-critical industries, but also to create more efficient, productive and effective workplace personnel with longer and more fulfilling careers. This requires improved acute fatigue mitigation, as well as the prevention of cumulative fatigue build-up and the formation of acute-on-chronic fatigue. The health recommendations for fatigue mitigation outlined in this paper are pertinent to all professions where employees have high rates of both acute and chronic fatigue.

AB  - Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a dominant disease burden in China. Although China has a prevention-centered NCD strategy, the implementation effect in the community has been subjected to manpower and financial difficulties. Engaging community health workers (CHWs) in community-based interventions may be a cost-effective approach to relieve the resource shortage and improve health. This review aimed to synthesize evidence on types of NCD-related care that was provided by CHWs in China, and to identify relevant barriers and facilitators. Methods: A literature search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases for English-written, peer-reviewed articles published from 1996 to 2016 that reported findings from NCD-related interventions delivered by CHWs in China. Each article was extracted independently by two researchers. Results: Twenty distinct studies met the inclusion criteria. The two most common types of CHW-led NCD-related care were diabetes and hypertension management (n = 7) and mental health care (n = 7). Thirteen studies discussed the barriers and 16 studies reported facilitators. The most common barriers included lack of support (n = 6), lack of resources (n = 4), and heavy reliance on technology (n = 4). The common facilitators included an integrated health system (n = 9), community and patient trust (n = 5), high quality training (n = 5), and CHWs' capacity (n = 5). Fourteen studies mentioned training content, while only eight described detailed procedures and duration. Conclusions: This review suggests that trained and supervised Chinese CHWs had the capacity to provide grassroots NCDs preventive interventions. In order to increase the generalizability and sustainability of such programs, studies with robust designs are needed to explore the effectiveness of CHW-led programs, and the intervention strategies to improve the practice of CHWs in various settings.

AB  - Early intervention is a fundamental principle in health care and the past two decades have seen it belatedly introduced into the field of mental health. This began in psychotic disorders, arguably the least promising place to start. The steady accumulation of scientific evidence for early intervention has eventually overwhelmed the sceptics, transformed thinking in psychotic disorders and created an international wave of service reform. This paradigm shift has paved the way to a more substantial one: early intervention across the full diagnostic spectrum. 75% of mental illnesses emerge before the age of 25 years, and young people bear the major burden for those disorders that threaten the many decades of productive adult life. The paradox is that young people aged between 12 and 25 years have had by far the worst levels of access to mental health care across the whole lifespan. Health services are poorly designed, grossly under-resourced and typically unfriendly to, and untrusted by, young people. Furthermore, until recently there has been a quite striking lack of interest in this transitional age group from clinicians and researchers alike, who had unthinkingly accepted the paediatric-adult split of mainstream medicine without questioning its utility and validity for our field and our young patients. Over the past decade, however, a major shift in momentum has occurred to take early intervention in youth mental health more seriously. Here we discuss the recent advances and evidence supporting an innovative integrated model of youth mental health care and look to the future.

AB  - Objectives: To propose collective well-being as a holistic measure of the overall "health" of a community. To define collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across 5 domains (vitality, opportunity, connectedness, contribution, and inspiration) and introduce an actionable model that demonstrates how community characteristics affect collective well-being. To review the literature describing each domain's association with health outcomes and community characteristics' associations with collective well-being. Methods: We came to consensus on topics describing each component of our conceptual model. Because "well-being" is not indexed in MEDLINE, we performed topic-specific database searches and examined bibliographies of papers retrieved. We excluded articles that were limited to narrow subtopics or studies within small subpopulations. Preference was given to quasi-experimental or randomized studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion of all articles. Results: Reviewed literature supported each of the proposed domains as important aspects of collective well-being and as determinants of individual or community health. Evidence suggests a broad range of community characteristics support collective well-being. Conclusions: The health and quality of life of a community may be improved by focusing efforts on community characteristics that support key aspects of well-being. Future work should develop a unified measure of collective well-being to evaluate the relative impact of specific efforts on the collective well-being of communities.

AB  - Biomarkers of antioxidant and biotransformation systems are commonly used to assess polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution in fish. Despite their extensive application of biomarkers, contradictory results are vastly reported in the literature, even for the same species in similar contamination scenarios. This study aims to verify response patterns of biomarkers in fish exposed to PAHs. Through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we were able to evaluate: (i)overall magnitude of PAHs effects on biotransformation and oxidative stress biomarkers; (ii) patterns of response among experimental approaches (laboratory, field and active biomonitoring), environment (marine and freshwater) and fish habitat (pelagic, demersal, etc.); (iii) effects of exposure route, time and concentration of PAHs; and (iv) which biomarkers respond best to PAHs exposure. Overall, biomarker responses were significantly affected by PAHs exposure. The activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lipid peroxide (LPO) significantly increased in fish exposed to PAHs, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not affected. Amongst responsive biomarkers, EROD and GST activities significantly differed among approaches and between marine and freshwater environments, but were not affected by fish habitat. GSSG levels were higher in fish from laboratory bioassays compared to the field, but did not differ between environments nor habitats. Exposure route played a major role only for GST and GPx responses. Finally, increasing PAHs concentration and exposure time had a significant effect on all assessed biomarkers, except for CAT. We conclude that EROD and GST are robust biomarkers to assess PAHs effects in fish. Contrarily, CAT is an inadequate biomarker of PAHs exposure since no significant response was observed. Our study also highlighted some research gaps in PAHs contamination studies, such as a clear lack of active biomonitoring experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While significant advances have been made with scientific knowledge, the translation of their promising results has not led to any new therapies. In Parkinson's disease, a long list of clinical studies, based on preclinical models with exogenous neurotoxins, has failed. Therefore, the aim of this opinion paper is to open discussion about preclinical models for Parkinson's disease based on neurotoxins.

AB  - Tailoring psychological treatments to men's specific needs has been a topic of concern for decades given evidence that many men are reticent to seek professional health care. However, existing literature providing clinical recommendations for engaging men in psychological treatments is diffuse. The aim of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive summary of recommendations for how to engage men in psychological treatment. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2017. Titles and abstracts were reviewed; data extracted and synthesized thematically. Of 3,627 citations identified, 46 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty articles (65%) were reviews or commentaries; 23 (50%) provided broad recommendations for working with all men. Findings indicate providing male-appropriate psychological treatment requires clinicians to consider the impact of masculine socialization on their client and themselves, and how gender norms may impact clinical engagement and outcomes. Existing literature also emphasized specific process micro-skills (e.g., self-disclosure, normalizing), language adaption (e.g., male-oriented metaphors) and treatment styles most engaging for men (e.g., collaborative, transparent, action-oriented, goal-focused). Presented are clinical recommendations for how to engage men in psychological treatments including paying attention to tapping the strengths of multiple masculinities coexisting within and across men. Our review suggests more empirically informed tailored interventions are needed, along with formal program evaluations to advance the evidence base.

AB  - Background: The tendency to interpret ambiguity as threat (negative interpretation) has been implicated in cognitive models of anxiety. A significant body of research has examined the association between anxiety and negative interpretation, and reviews suggest there is a robust positive association in adults. However, evidence with children and adolescents has been inconsistent. This study aimed to provide a systematic quantitative assessment of the association between anxiety and negative interpretation in children and adolescents. Method: Following systematic searches and screening for eligibility, 345 effects sizes from 77 studies were meta-analysed. Results: Overall a medium positive association was found between anxiety and negative interpretation in children and adolescents ((d) over cap = .62). Two variables significantly moderated this effect. Specifically, the association increased in strength with increasing age and when the content of ambiguous scenarios matched the anxiety subtype under investigation. Conclusions: Results extend findings from adult literature by demonstrating an association in children and adolescents with evidence for content specificity in the association. Age effects imply a role for development. Results raise considerations for when and for whom clinical treatments for anxiety focusing on interpretation bias are appropriate. The vast majority of studies included in the review have used correlational designs and there are a limited number of studies with young children. The results should be considered with these limitations in mind.

AB  - The dose-dependent effects of alcohol, where the initial euphoric and stimulant effects initiated by the exposure to low ethanol levels can quickly lead to a deadly consequence are well established. Thus, high blood alcohol concentration (BAC), as seen in alcoholics, can cause significant damage to various organs. At low concentrations (e.g., 10mg% or lower), however, beneficial effects of alcohol, particularly on cardiovascular function have been reported. Although, the latter assertion has been challenged by recent epidemiological studies, protective effects of low alcohol concentrations in vitro and in vivo relevant to the central nervous system (CNS) is well documented. In this review, the mechanism(s) leading to the detrimental effects of high BAC, as well as the beneficial effects of low BAC will be discussed. In addition, gender consideration is touched upon. Although further investigation is clearly warranted, it may be concluded that at least some of the beneficial outcomes of low BAC, including possible neuroprotection and antidepressant-like effects, may be due to elevation of the neurotropic factors and reduction of inflammatory mediators, whereas detrimental outcomes associated with high BAC, including neurotoxicity and depressive-like behavior may be due to reduction in neurotropic factors and elevation of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, new research strategies are suggested.

AB  - Background: As clozapine is under-prescribed in persons with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), it is necessary to better identify the determinants of health inequalities in access to clozapine use.
   Objective: To identify mental health professionals' characteristics or attitudes and institutional characteristics facilitating or limiting clozapine prescribing.
   Method: We systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles reporting: (i) mental health professionals' attitudes and characteristics favoring or limiting clozapine prescribing; (ii) institutional characteristics associated with variations in clozapine prescribing; (iii) interventions aimed at enhancing clozapine prescribing. Data were synthesized narratively.
   Results: A total of 31 articles reporting findings of 29 studies published from 1993 to 2017 in 11 countries fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The main prescriber-related barriers to clozapine prescribing are lack of personal prescribing experience and concern with pharmacological characteristics of clozapine (blood monitoring and adverse effects). Lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of clozapine does not appear as a major determinant of underprescription. Institutional-related characteristics favoring clozapine prescribing are prescribers' adherence to evidence-based medicine principles and learning by modelling from experienced clozapine prescribers.
   Conclusion: Effective strategies to increase access to clozapine in personswith TRS include implementation of integrated clozapine clinics, simplification of blood monitoring, education for prescribers and contact with experienced prescribers. Programs addressing barriers in clozapine prescription need to be disseminated more broadly to ensure persons with TRS have access to evidenced based treatments such as clozapine. Inequality in access to clozapine care should be more systematically handled by mental health facilities and health regulatory agencies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is now well accepted that there is a close relationship between noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons in the brain, especially referring to the modulation of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system on dopamine transmission. The disturbance of this modulation may contribute to neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. In this article, we briefly review evidence related to such modulation. Firstly, we illustrated the noradrenergic innervation and functional implication for the LC-NE system and nigra-striatum dopaminergic system. Furthermore, we depicted neuroprotective effects of the LC-NE on dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we present data implicating the potential mechanisms underlying the modulation of the LC-NE system on dopaminergic neurons, in particular the effects of NE as a neurotrophic factor and through its ability to stimulate the expression of other neurotrophic factors, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Finally, we discussed other mechanisms intrinsic to NE's effects. A better understanding of the noradrenergic modulation on dopaminergic neurons may be rewarding by significant advances in etiologic study and promising treatment of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The neural correlates of rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are extraordinarily robust; including REM-locked multisensory-motor integration and accompanying activation in the retrosplenial cortex, the supplementary eye field and areas encompassing cholinergic basal nucleus (Hong et al., 2009). The phenomenology of REMs speaks to the notion that perceptual experience in both sleep and wakefulness is a constructive process - in which we generate predictions of sensory inputs and then test those predictions through actively sampling the sensorium with eye movements. On this view, REMs during sleep may index an internalized active sampling or 'scanning' of self-generated visual constructs that are released from the constraints of visual input. If this view is correct, it renders REMs an ideal probe to study consciousness as "an exclusively internal affair" (Metzinger, 2009). In other words, REMs offer a probe of active inference in the sense of predictive coding - when the brain is isolated from the sensorium in virtue of the natural blockade of sensory afferents during REM sleep. Crucially, REMs are temporally precise events that enable powerful inferences based on time series analyses. As a natural, task-free probe, (REMs) could be used in non-compliant subjects, including infants and animals. In short, REMs constitute a promising probe to study the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of consciousness and perhaps the psychopathology of schizophrenia and autism, which have been considered in terms of aberrant predictive coding.

TI  - Gamified Cognitive Bias Modification Interventions for Psychiatric Disorders: Review
KW  - attention bias
KW  - cognitive bias
KW  - gamification
KW  - psychiatry
AB  - Background: Automatic biases, such as attentional biases and avoidance and interpretative biases, have been purported to be responsible for several psychiatric disorders. Gamification has been considered for cognitive bias modification, mainly to address the core issues of diminishing motivation to train over time, as bias modification intervention tasks tend to be highly repetitive. While a prior review has suggested how gamification strategies could be applied to such tasks, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of gamified cognitive bias modification interventions in the literature.
   Objective: The objective of this review is to understand the overall effectiveness of a gamified approach for cognitive bias modification and inform future research that seeks to integrate gamification technologies into existing conventional bias modification interventions.
   Methods: To identify the relevant articles for our review, the following search terminologies were used: ("cognitive bias" OR "attention bias" OR "interpret*bias" OR "approach bias" OR "avoidance bias") AND ("training" OR "modification" OR "practice" OR "therapy") AND ("gamification" OR "game elements" OR "game" OR "gaming" OR "game mechanics"). PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched systematically for articles published after 2000. Articles were included if they described a gamified cognitive bias modification task and included participants with underlying psychopathological symptoms. Data were systematically extracted from the identified articles, and a qualitative synthesis was performed.
   Results: Four studies evaluated gamified cognitive bias modification interventions. Two studies included participants with anxiety symptoms, one with affective symptoms, and one with alcohol problems. The conventional visual probe task paradigm was used in 3 studies, and the attentional visual search task paradigm was used in the last study. We found gaming elements incorporated to include that of animations, sounds, feedback, and a point-scoring system for response time and difficulty. Of the 4 identified studies, only 2 reported their gamified interventions to be effective.
   Conclusions: Our review is the first to systematically synthesize the evidence for gamified cognitive bias modification interventions. The results arising from our review should be considered in the future design and conceptualization of gamified cognitive bias modification interventions.

AB  - Background: Deficits in social cognition are well-recognized in both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is less clear how social cognition deficits differ between both disorders and what distinct mechanisms may underlie such differences. We aimed at reviewing available evidence from studies directly comparing social cognitive performance between individuals with schizophrenia and ASD.

Two researchers independently selected and extracted data according to PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for performance on social cognitive tasks evaluating: (1) emotion perception; (2) theory of mind (ToM); (3) emotional intelligence (managing emotions score of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test); and (4) social skills.
   Results: We identified 19 eligible studies for meta-analysis including a total of 1,040 patients (558 with schizophrenia and 482 with ASD). Eight studies provided data on facial emotion perception that evidenced a better performance by participants with schizophrenia compared to those with ASD (Hedges' g = 0.43; p = 0.031). No significant differences were found between groups in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (8 studies; Hedges' g = 0.22; p = 0.351), other ToM tasks (9 studies; Hedges' g = -0.03; p = 0.903), emotional intelligence (3 studies; Hedges' g = -0.17; p = 0.490), and social skills (3 studies; Hedges' g = 0.86; p = 0.056). Participants' age was a significant moderator of effect size in emotion perception and RMET analyzes, with larger differences favoring patients with schizophrenia being observed in studies with younger participants.
   Conclusions: The instruments that are currently available to evaluate social cognition poorly differentiate between individuals with schizophrenia and ASD. Combining behavioral tasks with neurophysiologic assessments may better characterize the differences in social cognition between both disorders.

AB  - BackgroundAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men experience worse health outcomes and are the most marginalized and disadvantaged population group in Australia. Primary health care services are critical to providing both clinical and social and emotional support, however, remain underutilized by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men. This review aims to better understand the utilization of primary health care services by Indigenous men and assess the effectiveness of strategies implemented to improve utilization.MethodsA four-step search strategy was employed across four databases to find peer-reviewed publications and grey literature from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and America. The search began in March 2015 and included the following databases PubMed, CINAHL, Informit (Indigenous collection) and Embase. Additional databases and websites were also searched for grey literature, reference lists of included publications were searched for additional studies and relevant experts were consulted.ResultsThe literature search found seven articles that met the inclusion criteria; four describing three research projects, plus three expert opinion pieces. The search was unable to find published research on strategies implemented to improve primary health care utilization by Indigenous men.There is limited published research focused on the utilization of primary health care by Indigenous men. From the identified papers Indigenous men described factors impacting utilization which were categorized into three primary organizing themes; those related to health services, the attitudes of Indigenous men and knowledge. It is evident from the identified papers that improvements in Indigenous health can only occur if future programs are developed in collaboration with health services and Indigenous men to address differing requirements.ConclusionsCurrently, health systems in Australia are limited in their ability to improve the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males without such strategies. Future research should focus on evaluating the implementation of men specific utilization strategies. It is through evidence-based research that subsequent policies and programs can be made and implemented to improve Indigenous men's health.

AB  - There are two important gaps of knowledge in depression treatment, namely the lack of biomarkers predicting response to antidepressants and the limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinical improvement. However, individually tailored treatment strategies and individualized prescription are greatly needed given the huge socio-economic burden of depression, the latency until clinical improvement can be observed and the response variability to a particular compound. Still, individual patient-level antidepressant treatment outcomes are highly unpredictable. In contrast to other therapeutic areas and despite tremendous efforts during the past years, the genomics era so far has failed to provide biological or genetic predictors of clinical utility for routine use in depression treatment. Specifically, we suggest to (1) shift the focus from the group patterns to individual outcomes, (2) use dimensional classifications such as Research Domain Criteria, and (3) envision better planning and improved connections between pre-clinical and clinical studies within translational research units. In contrast to studies in patients, animal models enable both searches for peripheral biosignatures predicting treatment response and in depth-analyses of the neurobiological pathways shaping individual antidepressant response in the brain. While there is a considerable number of animal models available aiming at mimicking disease-like conditions such as those seen in depressive disorder, only a limited number of preclinical or truly translational investigations is dedicated to the issue of heterogeneity seen in response to antidepressant treatment. In this mini-review, we provide an overview on the current state of knowledge and propose a framework for successful translational studies into antidepressant treatment response.

AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) represent a large unmet medical need. Exposure of the developing human embryo to alcohol can lead to life-long suffering. Despite the well documented deleterious effects of alcohol on the developing fetus, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, and FASD remains the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and other behavioral abnormalities. Particularly prevalent are the milder forms of the disease cluster, representing children who do not show obvious physical signs and who may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. To develop treatment and diagnostic tools, researchers have turned to animal models. The zebrafish is becoming one of the leading biomedical research organisms that may facilitate discovery of the biological mechanisms underlying this disease and the identification of biomarkers that may be used for diagnosis. Here we review the latest advances of this field, mostly focussing on the discoveries made in our own laboratory and others with zebrafish employed to analyze the effects of moderate to low level of exposure to alcohol. We argue that the zebrafish represents unique advantages, and adding information obtained with this species to the mix of other animal models will significantly increase translational relevance of animal biomedical research for the analysis of human FASD.

AB  - Testing of cognitive functions in rodent disease models constitutes a substantial sector of behavioral neuroscience. It is most often needed in phenotyping genetically modified new rodent (usually mouse) lines or in preclinical testing of cognitive effects of new CNS drugs. This review concerns present pitfalls and future perspectives in this large field, with an emphasis on memory testing in CNS disease models and their preclinical drug testing. It is important to realize that no behavioral test is specific for a single cognitive domain. There are numerous noncognitive factors that may lead to impaired performance in most widely applied memory tasks. It is important to rule these out by applying a battery of test that should include at least tests for motor functions, spontaneous activity and anxiety besides cognitive aspects. In addition, considering and reporting all task-relavant details will help to resolve the common problem that certain behavioral findings cannot be reproduced by other laboratories. More collaboration between molecular and behavioral neuroscience laboratories and systematic training of young neuroscientist on behavioral techniques will help ensure quality of behavioral studies in the future.

AB  - Omic sciences coupled with novel computational approaches such as machine intelligence offer completely new approaches to major depressive disorder (MDD) research. The complexity of MDD's pathophysiology is being integrated into studies examining MDD's biology within the omic fields. Lipidomics, as a late-comer among other omic fields, is increasingly being recognized in psychiatric research because it has allowed the investigation of global lipid perturbations in patients suffering from MDD and indicated a crucial role of specific patterns of lipid alterations in the development and progression of MDD. Combinatorial lipid-markers with high classification power are being developed in order to assist MDD diagnosis, while rodent models of depression reveal lipidome changes and thereby unveil novel treatment targets for depression. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of current breakthroughs and future trends in the field of lipidomics in MDD research and thereby paving the way for precision medicine in MDD.

AB  - The shelf sediments off Namibia are some of the most unusual and extreme marine habitats because of their extremely high hydrogen sulphide concentrations. High surface productivity of the northern Benguela upwelling system provides benthic life with so much carbon that biotic processes must rely on innovative mechanisms to cope with perennial anoxia and toxic hydrogen sulphide. Bottom dwelling communities are forced to adapt lifestyles to deal physiologically and behaviourally with these stressful conditions. The upside of hydrogen sulphide is that it fuels extensive mats of large sulphide-oxidizing bacteria on the seabed, which create detoxified habitat niches and food for the animals living there. The threat of hypoxic stress exacerbated by hydrogen sulphide is largely overcome in the water column by microbes that detoxify sulphide, allowing animals in the upper water layers to thrive in this productive upwelling area. The bearded goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus is a cornerstone species that successfully couples the inhospitable benthic environment with the pelagic. Benthic studies have as yet not characterized the sulphidic shelf communities, which have the potential to uncover biotic adaptations to toxic sulphide. This ancient shelf upwelling system has long operated under hypoxic pressure, balancing always the abundance of particulate food against oxygen limitation and hydrogen sulphide toxicity. Challenges faced by this unique system could include environmental changes related to climate change, or man-made physical disturbances of the anoxic, sulphide-rich seabed sediments.

AB  - Introduction: We conducted a systematic review to summarize the global evidence on person-centered care (PCC) interventions in delivery facilities in order to: (1) map the PCC objectives of past interventions (2) to explore the impact of PCC objectives on PCC and clinical outcomes.
   Methods: We developed a search strategy based on a current definition of PCC. We searched for English-language, peer-reviewed and original research articles in multiple databases from 1990 to 2016 and conducted hand searches of the Cochrane library and gray literature. We used systematic review methodology that enabled us to extract and synthesize quantitative and qualitative data. We categorized interventions according to their primary and secondary PCC objectives. We categorized outcomes into person-centered and clinical (labor and delivery, perinatal, maternal mental health).
   Results: Our initial search strategy yielded 9378 abstracts; we conducted full-text reviews of 32 quantitative, 6 qualitative, 2 mixed-methods studies, and 7 systematic reviews (N = 47). Past interventions pursued these primary PCC objectives: autonomy, supportive care, social support, the health facility environment, and dignity. An intervention's primary and secondary PCC objectives frequently did not align with the measured person-centered outcomes. Generally, PCC interventions either improved or made no difference to person-centered outcomes. There was no clear relationship between PCC objectives and clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions: This systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis of facility-based delivery interventions using a current definition of person-centered care. Current definitions of PCC propose new domains of inquiry but may leave out previous domains.

AB  - Many molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases have been revealed. However, it is unclear what role a putatively impaired neuronal transport with respect to altered mechanical properties of neurons play in the initiation and progression of such diseases. The biochemical aspects of intracellular axonal transport, which is important for molecular movements through the cytoplasm, e.g., mitochondrial movement, has already been studied. Interestingly, transport deficiencies are associated with the emergence of the affliction and potentially linked to disease transmission. Transport along the axon depends on the normal function of the neuronal cytoskeleton, which is also a major contributor to neuronal mechanical properties. By contrast, little attention has been paid to the mechanical properties of neurons and axons impaired by neurodegeneration, and of membraneless, phase-separated organelles such as stress granules (SGs) within neurons. Mechanical changes may indicate cytoskeleton reorganization and function, and thus give information about the transport and other system impairment. Nowadays, several techniques to investigate cellular mechanical properties are available. In this review, we discuss how select biophysical methods to probe material properties could contribute to the general understanding of mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate whether integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy leads to changes in lifestyle mediators of overweight and obesity in community-dwelling adults.MethodSix electronic databases were systematically searched up to 04 October, 2017. Analyses were restricted to randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy on lifestyle mediators of overweight and obesity (physical activity, diet, body composition) in community-dwelling adults. Meta-analyses were conducted using change scores from baseline in outcome measures specific to the lifestyle mediators of overweight and obesity to determine standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the quality of the evidence.ResultsTen randomised controlled trials involving 1949 participants were included. Results revealed moderate quality evidence that integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy had a significant effect in increasing physical activity levels in community-dwelling adults (SMD: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.31, p<0.05). The combined intervention resulted in a small, non-significant effect in body composition changes (SMD: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.24 to 0.01, p=0.07). Insufficient evidence existed for outcome measures relating to dietary change.DiscussionThe addition of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy to usual care can lead to modest improvements in physical activity and body composition for community-dwelling adults. The available evidence demonstrates that it is feasible to integrate MI with CBT and that this combined intervention has the potential to improve health-related outcomes.ConclusionThis review details recommendations for future research including the adoption of uniform objective outcome measures and well-defined interventions with sufficient follow-up durations and assessments of treatment fidelity.

AB  - Background: Studies investigating salivary cortisol level as susceptibility marker for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) produced inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to compare salivary cortisol concentration levels in PTSD patients with those in controls by synthesizing published data.
   Methods: We did a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of studies comparing concentrations of salivary cortisol between patients with PTSD and controls. The electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Psyc-ARTICLES were searched for relevant articles. A random-effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimator is used to synthesize the effect size (assessed by standardized mean difference).
   Results: A total of 784 articles were identified of which 22 were included in the final analysis. A trend of lower salivary cortisol levels was found in PTSD patients when compared with the controls (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI-0.53;-0.04, p = 0.022). Subgroup analysis showed that the salivary cortisol levels were lower in patients with PTSD than in controls in studies conducted after 2007 or in studies using saliva samples collected in the morning.
   Conclusions: The evidence from this meta-analysis supports that salivary samples collected in the morning consistently showed a lower salivary cortisol level in patients with PTSD than in controls, although whether salivary cortisol could be used as a diagnostic tool requires further research.

TI  - 'Levodopa Phobia': a review of a not uncommon and consequential phenomenon
KW  - EARLY PARKINSONS-DISEASE
AB  - 'Levodopa Phobia' is under-recognised in Parkinson's disease but can cause profound detrimental clinical complications if left to continue. Several types can be encountered in clinical practice and can be driven by a misplaced fear of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, other gastrointestinal side effects and also the theoretical notion that levodopa may be toxic to dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The condition can be underpinned by a sense of strong influence from the physicians or carers who are unwilling to prescribe or consider levodopa, and also high levels of anxiety or even impulsive compulsive traits in patients who have been influenced by available literature or social media-based information. If unrecognised, the clinical issue may lead to motor deterioration and related muscle contractures leading to social isolation as well as a range of non-motor symptoms. In some, there may be emergence of intrusive impulse control disorders because of reliance on only dopamine agonists related to the fear of taking levodopa. Four cases illustrate the different patterns of 'Levodopa Phobia' in this study. Management of levodopa phobia is complex and includes recognition and skilled neuropsychological interventions to break the misperceptions about the complications of levodopa therapy.

AB  - This meta-analytic review addresses whether the major dimensions of trait personality relate to components of human sexuality. A comprehensive literature search identified 137 studies that met inclusion criteria (761 effect sizes; total n = 420,595). Pooled mean effects were computed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Mean effect sizes from 100 separate meta-analyses provided evidence that personality relates to theoretically predicted components of sexuality and sexual health. Neuroticism was positively related to sexual dissatisfaction (r(+) = .18), negative emotions (r(+) = .42), and symptoms of sexual dysfunction (r(+) = .16). Extraversion was positively related to sexual activity (r(+) = .17) and risky sexual behavior (r(+) = .18), and negatively related to symptoms of sexual dysfunction (r(+) = -.17). Openness was positively related to homosexual orientation (r(+) = .16) and liberal attitudes toward sex (r(+) = .19). Agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively related to sexually aggressive behavior (r(+) = -.20; r(+) = -.14) and sexual infidelity (r(+) = -.18; r(+) = -.17). Less robust evidence indicated that extraversion related negatively, and neuroticism positively, to child sexual abuse, and that openness related negatively to homophobic attitudes. Random effects metaregression identified age, gender, and study quality as important moderators of pooled mean effects. These findings might be of interest to health care professionals developing health care services that aim to promote sexually healthy societies.

Culturally valid and appropriate tools are needed to ensure accurate outcomes. The purpose of this review is to examine the methods used to diagnose psychiatric disorders in Indigenous Australians and identify whether these are culturally appropriate or valid.
   MethodA systematic search of available literature was undertaken in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Web of Science, Medline, and Informit Health Indigenous Australians Peoples Collections). Narrative synthesis was used to analyse the data obtained, with a quantitative evaluations of study quality and cultural validity.
   ResultsTwelve articles were included for review. Six studies were of diagnostic tools and none had been validated for use with Indigenous Australians. Another six used practitioner assessment. Some studies indirectly referenced cultural competence on behalf of the practitioner, but again on the whole this was lacking.
   ConclusionsFurther validation of the use of diagnostic instruments in Indigenous Australians is needed so that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in this population can be accurately determined. In addition, practitioners working with Indigenous Australians should have some training in cultural awareness or competence, and consider the cultural appropriateness of diagnostic tools when applied to this population.

AB  - Rehabilitation seeks to optimize functioning of people with impairments and includes a range of specific health services-diagnosis, treatment, surgery, assistive devices, and therapy. Evidence on access to rehabilitation services for people with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. A systematic review was conducted to examine this in depth. In February 2017, six databases were searched for studies measuring access to rehabilitation among people with disabilities in LMICs. Eligible measures of access to rehabilitation included: use of assistive devices, use of specialist health services, and adherence to treatment. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Data was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Of 13,048 screened studies, 77 were eligible for inclusion. These covered a broad geographic area. 17% of studies measured access to hearing-specific services; 22% vision-specific; 31% physical impairment-specific; and 44% measured access to mental impairment-specific services. A further 35% measured access to services for any disability. A diverse range of measures of disability and access were used across studies making comparability difficult. However, there was some evidence that access to rehabilitation is low among people with disabilities. No clear patterns were seen in access by equity measures such as age, locality, socioeconomic status, or country income group due to the limited number of studies measuring these indicators, and the range of measures used. Access to rehabilitation services was highly variable and poorly measured within the studies in the review, but generally shown to be low. Far better metrics are needed, including through clinical assessment, before we have a true appreciation of the population level need for and coverage of these services.

AB  - Age-related changes in the brain reflect a dynamic interaction of genetic, epigenetic, phenotypic, and environmental factors that can be temporally restricted or more longitudinally present throughout the lifespan. Fundamental to these mechanisms is the capacity for physiological adaptation through modulation of diverse molecular and biochemical signaling occurring from the intracellular to the network-systemic level throughout the brain. A number of agents that affect the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD)-like effects in experimental models exhibit temporal features, and mechanisms of hormetic dose responses. These findings have particular significance since the hormetic dose response describes the amplitude and range of potential therapeutic effects, thereby affecting the design and conduct of studies of interventions against PD (and other neurodegenerative diseases), and may also be important to a broader consideration of hormetic processes in resilient adaptive responses that might afford protection against the onset and/or progression of PD and related disorders.

AB  - To assess predictors of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is important since it is known that the early diagnosis is associated with a better response to the treatment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to assess the role of the suicide risk in the diagnosis conversion to bipolar disorder. We searched Pubmed, Bireme, Scopus, and PsycINFO with no year restriction for articles containing the words (suicidal or suicide or suicide risk or suicide attempt) and (conversion or switch) and (bipolar disorder or mania or hypomania or bipolar disorders). The review included four studies, with only one confirming that subjects who converted to bipolar disorder had higher rates of suicide risk than subjects who did not convert to bipolar disorder. The main limitation of this review is that few longitudinal studies assessed the predictors of conversion to bipolar disorders. In conclusion, suicide risk appears to be a predictor of bipolar disorder; nevertheless, more studies are needed to confirm this association.

AB  - People who internalize an observer's perspective of their bodies are understood to experience 'self-objectification', a process which is associated with increased risk of poor body image, depression, and eating disorders. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the literature which has explored the relationship between trait self objectification and personality traits. Five databases were searched and records were included for review if they: (a) used quantitative methodologies; (b) were published before March 2018, inclusive; (c) were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and; (d) were available in English language. The search yielded a total of 2636 unique articles: 16 studies within 15 articles met all inclusion criteria. The results were collated using narrative synthesis. Self-objectification was most consistently and positively associated with neuroticism, perfectionism, and narcissism across multiple studies. Insufficient research was available to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between self-objectification and other personality traits, and sex moderation effects were indeterminate. Clinical applications and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - AimOver the past 20 years, early management of psychosis has become both a research and policy priority. In Western countries, psychotic disorders appear more prevalent in migrant and minority ethnic groups than in native or dominant groups. Moreover, disparities exist in health conditions and access to care among immigrants and minority ethnic groups, compared with native-born and majority groups. Appropriate early detection tools are necessary for the different groups.
   MethodsThis systematic review provides a synthesis of the assessment and discussion of transcultural issues in ultra-high-risk (UHR) cohorts. The Medline database was searched via PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published in English from 1995 to 2017. All 79 studies included are prospective UHR cohort studies that used the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS).
   ResultsIn UHR cohort studies that used the CAARMS, transcultural data (native language, ethnicity, place of birth, migration) are rarely collected, and inadequate ability to speak the dominant language is a common exclusion criterion. When they are included, the CAARMS scores differ between some minorities and the native-born majority group.
   ConclusionsThis systematic review demonstrates barriers to the access to participation in early intervention research for migrants and ethnic minorities. This selection bias may result in lower validity for the CAARMS among these populations and thus in inadequate intervention programmes. Along with targeted studies, minorities' access to participation in UHR cohorts should be improved through 3 tools: interpreters at recruitment and for administration of CAARMS, a guide to cultural formulation and transcultural data collection.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology.
   Objectives: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (called Systematic Review 1 in the protocol) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on stroke (called Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way.
   Data sources: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts.
   Study eligibility and criteria: We will include working-age (>= 15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude children (< 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to stroke, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week).
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

AB  - Objectives: Depression is a frequent but potentially treatable clinical dimension in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (PWS). However, there is a lack of consensual recommendations regarding the optimal strategy to manage depression in PWS. In this study, we aimed to compare the various proposed strategies to define a core set of valid care recommendations for depression management in PWS.
   Methods: After a systematic search of the literature, the methodological quality of 10 international guidelines from four continents was compared using a validated guideline appraisal instrument (AGREE II). Key recommendations for the management of depression in PWS were subsequently reviewed and discussed.
   Results: The methodological quality of the guidelines was heterogeneous. Although all guidelines proposed pharmacotherapy, psychosocial interventions were a minor concern. Waiting for antipsychotic effects mostly was recommended during the acute phase of schizophrenia. During the postpsychotic phase of the illness, a switch to a second-generation antipsychotic and/or the adjunction of an antidepressant were the primary recommendations. Cognitive behavioural therapy and other medications were considered with strong variations.
   Conclusions: Further studies are needed to strengthen the level of evidence for antidepressive approaches in PWS. The inclusion of PWS as stakeholders is also considered to be a major issue for future guideline development.

   Interpersonal violence is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The strength and population effect of modifiable risk factors for interpersonal violence, and the quality of the research evidence is not known.
   Aims
   We aimed to examine the strength and population effect of modifiable risk factors for interpersonal violence, and the quality and reproducibility of the research evidence.
   Method
   We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of risk factors for interpersonal violence. A systematic search was conducted to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses in general population samples. Effect sizes were extracted, converted into odds ratios and synthesised, and population attributable risk fractions (PAF) were calculated. Quality analyses were performed, including of small study effects, adjustment for confounders and heterogeneity. Secondary analyses for aggression, intimate partner violence and homicide were conducted, and systematic reviews (without meta-analyses) were summarised.
   Results
   We identified 22 meta-analyses reporting on risk factors for interpersonal violence. Neuropsychiatric disorders were among the strongest in relative and absolute terms. The neuropsychiatric risk factor that had the largest effect at a population level were substance use disorders, with a PAF of 14.8% (95% CI 9.0-21.6%), and the most important historical factor was witnessing or being a victim of violence in childhood (PAF = 12.2%, 95% CI 6.5-17.4%). There was evidence of small study effects and large heterogeneity.
   Conclusions
   National strategies for the prevention of interpersonal violence may need to review policies concerning the identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors.

AB  - Autoimmune encephalitis is a group of neurological diseases characterized by brain damage by autoantibodies towards extra- or intracellular structures of the nervous system that act as antigens. The combination of neurological and mental disorders, as well as the ability to identify a specific antigen and antibody axis, makes these diseases extremely interesting from the standpoint of molecular psychiatry and the creation of new experimental models of cognitive processes, clinical diagnosis and targeted treatment. However, despite active research in this direction and a large number of specific antibodies, the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis is often extremely difficult and can be made only by clinical criteria. This study provides an overview of the available data on the history of discovery and study of autoimmune encephalitis, describes the methods for searching of antibodies that exist today and the further prospects for studying this group of diseases.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive loss of cognitive and/or motor function and pose major challenges for societies with rapidly aging populations. Human genetics studies have shown that disease-causing rare mutations and risk-associated common alleles overlap in different neurodegenerative disorders. Here we review the intricate genotype-phenotype relationships and common cellular pathways emerging from recent genetic and mechanistic studies. Shared pathological mechanisms include defective protein quality-control and degradation pathways, dysfunctional mitochondrial homeostasis, stress granules, and maladaptive innate immune responses. Research efforts have started to bear fruit, as shown by recent treatment successes and an encouraging therapeutic outlook.

AB  - Background: Observational research has found that involuntary treatment provides limited benefits in terms of long-term clinical outcomes. Our aim was to review literature on existing interventions in order to identify helpful approaches to improve outcomes of involuntary treatment.
   Methods: This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Seven databases (AMED, PsycINFO, Embase Classic, Embase 1974-2017, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and BNI) were searched and the results were analysed in a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Nineteen papers describing fourteen different interventions were included. Using narrative synthesis the interventions were summarised into three categories: a) structured patient-centred care planning; b) specialist therapeutic interventions; c) systemic changes to hospital practice. The methodologies used and outcomes assessed were heterogeneous. Most studies were of low quality, although five interventions were tested in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Preliminary evidence supports structured patient-centred care planning interventions have an effect on long-term outcomes (such as readmission), and that specialist therapeutic interventions and systemic changes to hospital practice have an effect on reducing the use of coercive measures on wards.
   Conclusions: This review shows that it is possible to conduct rigorous intervention-testing studies in involuntary patients, including RCTs. Yet, the overall evidence is limited. Structured patient-centred care planning interventions show promise for the improvement of long-term outcomes and should be further evaluated. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Psychotherapeutic interventions in childhood and adolescence are recognized as a mental treatment and as a tool to reduce psychological disorders in youth and adulthood. Therefore, there is an increasing concern about evidence of effectiveness of mental disorder interventions and adequacy of measurement. The objectives of this systematic review were to investigate predominant research designs and instruments used in Brazilian studies describing psychotherapeutic interventions with children and adolescents and to examine how these instruments are described regarding evidence of validity and reliability.
   Method: Five databases were surveyed, and for each one two independent judges performed the selection of records and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: The final database comprised 28 papers, in which 92 instruments were referred. Fifty-seven instruments cited did not have descriptions of evidence of validity for the Brazilian population; for 31 instruments, validity evidence was mentioned, but the study did not detail which validity parameter was used; three studies described content validity evidence for their instruments. Furthermore, information about reliability was described for only two instruments.
   Conclusion: A lack of studies in the field of child and adolescent psychotherapy was found in Brazil. There is a significant need for the field to attend both the psychometric properties and the quality of description of research instruments. The scientific production of studies focused on the evaluation of psychotherapeutic interventions may promote evidence-based psychotherapy and justify the offer of mental treatment in different contexts.

AB  - Objective Depression after stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) is common but often assumed to be undertreated without reliable evidence being available. Thus, we aimed to determine treatment rates and investigate the application of guidelines in these conditions.
   Methods Databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus were systematically searched without language restriction from inception to June 30, 2017. Prospective observational studies with consecutive recruitment reporting any antidepressant treatment in adults with depression after stroke or MI were included. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates of treatment rates.
   Results Fifty-five studies reported 32 stroke cohorts (n = 8938; pooled frequency of depression = 34%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 29%-38%) and 17 MI cohorts (n = 10,767; pooled frequency of depression = 24%, 95% CI = 20%-28%). In 29 stroke cohorts, 24% (95% CI = 20%-27%) of 2280 depressed people used antidepressant medication. In 15 MI cohorts, 14% (95% CI = 8%-19%) of 2381 depressed people used antidepressant medication indicating a lower treatment rate than in stroke. Two studies reported use of psychosocial interventions, indicating that less than 10% of participants were treated.
   Conclusions Despite the high frequency of depression after stroke and MI and the existence of efficacious treatment strategies, people often remain untreated. Innovative strategies are needed to increase the use of effective antidepressive interventions in patients with cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Many neurodegenerative diseases are derived from the combined consequences of genetic and environmental factors. One of the common features implicated in the neurodegenerative processes is aggregation of disease specific neuronal proteins. These proteins are accumulated not only directly in neurons, but also indirectly involve glial cells. Whereas the focus of research has been directed towards the impacts of protein aggregation upon neurons, the influence that it exerts on glial cells has been relatively overlooked. Recent studies, however, provide strong evidence on pathogenic responses of glial cells originated from the neuron-derived protein aggregates. Here, we critically examine the latest advancement in investigating how glial cells are activated in neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with a-synuclein aggregates. Often referred to as synucleinopathies, these include Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. To further illustrate, we would discuss paracrine actions of a-synuclein aggregates secreted from neuronal cells in promoting pathogenic reactions from various types of glia and evaluate the non-cell-autonomous mechanism compared to a cell-autonomous one. Such analyses of the impacts of glial responses in neurodegenerative diseases, in the long term, could be further utilized in developing different treatments of the diseases and potentially discovering new drugs.

AB  - Background: Fetal development is a crucial window of susceptibility in which exposure-related alterations can be induced on the molecular level, leading to potential changes in metabolism and development. The placenta serves as a gatekeeper between mother and fetus, and is in contact with environmental stressors throughout pregnancy. This makes the placenta as a temporary organ an informative non-invasive matrix suitable to investigate omics-related aberrations in association with in utero exposures such as ambient air pollution.
   Objectives: To summarize and discuss the current evidence and define the gaps of knowledge concerning human placental-omics markers in association with prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution.
   Methods: Two investigators independently searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases to identify all studies published until January 2017 with an emphasis on epidemiological research on prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution and the effect on placental-omics signatures.
   Results: From the initial 386 articles, 25 were retained following an a priori set inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified eleven studies on the genome, two on the transcriptome, five on the epigenome, five on the proteome category, one study with both genomic and proteomic topics, and one study with both genomic and transcriptomic topics. Six studies discussed the triple relationship between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, the associated placental -omics marker(s), and the potential effect on disease development later in life. So far, no metabolomic or exposomic data discussing associations between the placenta and prenatal exposure to air pollution have been published.
   Conclusions: Integration of placental biomarkers in an environmental epidemiological context enables researchers to address fundamental questions essential in unraveling the fetal origin of disease and helps to better define the pregnancy exposome of air pollution.

AB  - Chronic stress has been extensively linked to disturbances in glutamatergic signalling. Emerging from this field of research is a considerable number of studies identifying the ability of purines at the pre-, post-, and perisynaptic levels to tune glutamatergic neurotransmission. While the evidence describing purinergic control of glutamate has continued to grow, there has been relatively little attention given to how chronic stress modulates purinergic functions. The available research on this topic has demonstrated that chronic stress can not only disturb purinergic receptors involved in the regulation of glutamate neurotransmission, but also perturb glial-dependent purinergic signalling. This review will provide a detailed examining of the complex literature relating to glutamatergic-purinergic interactions with a focus on both neuronal and glial contributions. Once these detailed interactions have been described and contextualised, we will integrate recent findings from the field of stress research.

AB  - Background: Heatwaves form a serious public health threat, especially for vulnerable groups. Interventions such as active outreach programs, exposure reduction measures and monitoring and mapping of at-risk groups are increasingly implemented across the world but little is known about their effect.
   Objectives: To assess how vulnerable groups are identified and reached in heat health interventions, to understand the effectiveness and efficiency of those interventions, and to identify research gaps in existing literature.
   Methods: We performed a literature search in relevant scientific literature databases and searched with a four element search model for articles published from 1995 onward. We extracted data on intervention measures, target group and evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency.
   Results: We identified 23 eligible studies. Patterns exist in type of interventions 1) to detect and 2) to influence extrinsic and intrinsic risk and protective factors. Results showed several intervention barriers related to the variety and intersection of these factors, as well as the self-perception of vulnerable groups, and misconceptions and unfavorable attitudes towards intervention benefits. While modest indications for the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions were found, efficiency remains unclear.
   Discussion: Interventions entailed logical combinations of measures, subsumed as packages. Evidence for effective and efficient intervention is limited by the difficulty to determine effects and because single measures are mutually dependent. Interventions prioritized promoting behavioral change and were based on behavioral assumptions that remain untested and mechanisms not worked out explicitly.
   Conclusions: Multifaceted efforts are needed to tailor interventions, compiled in heat health warning systems and action plans for exposure reduction and protection of vulnerable populations, to fit the social, economic and geographical context. Besides adequately addressing relevant risk and protective factors, the challenge is to integrate perspectives of vulnerable groups. Future research should focus on intervention barriers and improving the methods of effectiveness and efficiency evaluation.

AB  - Human social activity is a continuous dynamic behavior consisting of live social signal exchanges; thus, studying interactions among multiple humans is critical to understanding social cognition. Indeed, social neuroscience focusing on such aspects-interactive social neuroscience-is an emerging field of interest. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has played a significant role in accelerating this field by enabling real-world neuroimaging for various populations. The present paper will first review previous hyperscanning studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electroencephalography (EEG). We will then summarize attempts and findings of fNIRS hyperscanning studies on social interaction in adult populations. Finally, we will review recent investigations of interactive social neuroscience in young populations and show preliminary results from a mother-infant hyperscanning study. These studies have predominantly revealed synchronized brain activities between humans and have identified conditions in which such inter-personal connectivity was found to be increased. Furthermore, these studies suggest possible mechanisms of inter-brain coupling: a process that recruits both mirror system and mentalization networks. Although fNIRS hyperscanning of infants remains limited, the reviewed literature demonstrates significant potential for fNIRS to disclose the interactive social brain and its development.

AB  - Psychopharmacological treatment of pregnant women is an area of continued controversy; extensive observational research on the use of antidepressant medications in pregnancy has found these medications to be associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. However, depression itself has also been associated with increased risk of those same outcomes, and only recently have researchers begun trying to compare treated with untreated depression. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to integrate those comparative studies and compare risks and benefits. PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL searches; study selection; and data extraction were carried out using PRISMA guidelines. Eleven prospective observational and case-control studies were selected for final inclusion. Risk of low birth weight and related outcomes do not differ between antidepressant-treated pregnant women and untreated depressed women. Average gestational lengths tend to be slightly shorter with antidepressant use but it is unclear whether these differences are clinically meaningful or extend to preterm delivery. Very limited research on spontaneous abortion did not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding that outcome. The low number of studies meeting criteria highlights the need for further research to aid in risk-benefit analysis for women considering antidepressant use in pregnancy. While further research is necessary, discontinuing antidepressant treatment of major depression in pregnancy due to concerns about length of gestation, birth weight, or spontaneous abortion is not supported by the evidence available at this time.

AB  - Limited ability to engage underserve dracial-ethnic minority young adults into treatment contributes to mental health disparities among this population. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the evidence for interventions that can improve their engagement with mental health services. A database search and bibliographic review yielded 1264 studies that were assessed according to the following inclusion criteria: sample with a mean age between 13 and 27; sufficient ethnic/racial representation (at least 50%); an explicitly stated objective for the intervention of improving mental health treatment engagement among adolescents and young adults (e.g., initiating treatment, retention, completion); and evaluation of an engagement outcome, such as session attendance or service utilization. Ten studies met inclusion criteria. Studies varied according to level of evidence for efficacy with underserved young adults, with four meeting criteria as probably efficacious. Interventions that were family based or were culturally adapted for age group or race-ethnicity also showed possible efficacy and promising results. Although the lack of studies focused on this population limited findings, evidence supports incorporating family and natural supports in a developmentally appropriate way, facilitating independence, and attending to cultural context as key components of interventions designed to address the unmet need in underserved minority young adults.

AB  - Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) are at high risk for high levels of sedentary behaviour. To inform the development of programmes to reduce sedentary behaviour, insight into the correlates is needed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to review the evidence on correlates of sedentary behaviour in adults with ID. We performed a systematic literature search in Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar up to 19 January 2018, resulting in nine included studies that were published from 2011 to 2018. Correlates were categorized according to the ecological model. Studies predominantly focused on individual level correlates. Of those correlates studied in more than one study, having epilepsy was associated with less sedentary behaviour and inconsistent results were found for sex, genetic syndromes, weight status, physical health, mobility, level of ID, and mental health. Of the few interpersonal and environmental factors studied, only living arrangements were studied in more than one study, with inconsistent results. To date, we have limited and inconclusive evidence about correlates of sedentary behaviour in adults with ID. Only when future studies unravel correlates and determinants, across all domains of the ecological model, will the potential opportunities to improve health by reducing sedentary behaviour come within reach.

AB  - BackgroundLittle is known about the health of GMS commercial fishers and seafarers, many of whom are migrants and some trafficked. This systematic review summarizes evidence on occupational, physical, sexual and mental health and violence among GMS commercial fishers/seafarers.MethodsWe searched 5 electronic databases and purposively searched grey literature. Quantitative or qualitative studies reporting prevalence or risk of relevant outcomes were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles. Data were extracted on nationality and long/short-haul fishing where available.ResultsWe identified 33 eligible papers from 27 studies. Trafficked fishers/seafarers were included in n=12/13 grey literature and n=1/20 peer-reviewed papers. Among peer-reviewed papers: 11 focused on HIV/AIDS/sexual health; nine on occupational/physical health; one study included mental health of trafficked fishers. Violence was quantitatively measured in eight papers with prevalence of: 11-26% in port convenience samples; 68-100% in post-trafficking service samples. Commercial fishers/seafarers whether trafficked or not worked extremely long hours; trafficked long-haul fishers had very limited access to care following injuries or illness. Lesser-known risks reported among fishers included penile oil injections and beriberi. We found just one work safety intervention study and inconclusive evidence for differences in the outcomes by nationality. Findings are limited by methodological weaknesses of primary studies.ConclusionResults show an absence of high-quality epidemiological studies beyond sexual health. Formative and pilot intervention research on occupational, physical and mental health among GMS commercial fishers and seafarers is needed. Future studies should include questions about violence and exploitation. Ethical and reporting standards of grey literature should be improved.Trial RegistrationReview registration number: PROSPERO 2014: CRD42014009656.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetes is on rise worldwide and environmental factors are being increasingly recognized to be involved in this rise. An emerging body of evidence has evaluated the impact of long-term exposure to noise on diabetes mellitus, highlighting the need to synthesize this evidence.
   Objectives: To systematically review and conduct meta-analysis of the available evidence on the association between long-term exposure to transport and occupational noise exposure and diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: Selected databases were searched for available evidence published till September 13th, 2017 following MOOSE guidelines. The quality of articles was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Random effects meta-analysis was applied to abstract combined estimates for diabetes mellitus per 5 dB increase in noise exposure. We evaluated the heterogeneity applying Cochran's Q test and quantified it using 12 statistic. Meta-regressions were conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot and Egger's test.
   Results: Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria of which nine including five prospective cohorts, two cross-sectional and two case-control studies with a total number of 444460 adult participants and 17430 diabetes mellitus cases included in meta-analyses. We observed a 6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3%, 9%) increase in the risk of diabetes mellitus per 5 dB increase in noise exposure regardless of its source. Source-specific analyses were suggestive for stronger associations for air traffic noise (combined odds ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29 per 5 dB increase in exposure) flowed by road traffic noise (combined odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.12). We observed some indications of publication bias; however the findings were robust after trim and fill test. Meta-regression analyses showed that the adjustment in general, and not specifically related to air pollution, could predict the between-study heterogeneity in reported associations.
   Conclusions: The results indicate an increased risk of diabetes mellitus associated with noise exposure, mainly related to air and road traffic.

AB  - AimEarly intervention services (EISs) for first-episode psychosis (FEP) have been established internationally, however, service disengagement is a recurrent concern resulting in unplanned treatment cessation. The implications of this are far-reaching due to the financial and personal costs associated with untreated symptoms. The aim of this meta-synthesis was to collect, interpret and synthesize qualitative research about how engagement is experienced within EISs for FEP.
   MethodsA systematic search was conducted in PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid Emcare from date of conception to November 2016. Following initial screening, 91 abstracts and 13 full texts were reviewed for eligibility. Nine studies were then critically appraised using the CASP tool for qualitative studies, data were systematically extracted and results were synthesized using constant comparison and reciprocal translational analysis.
   ResultsNine qualitative studies explored engagement with EISs, from the perspectives of service users and their caregivers. No studies were found from the perspectives of clinicians or services. All 9 studies employed an inductive methodology, within an interpretivist epistemology. Five main themes were identified: experiences of finding help; factors promoting engagement; the therapeutic relationship; the role of caregivers in supporting engagement; and factors impacting ongoing engagement.
   ConclusionsThere is a critical need to stimulate discussion around this multifaceted phenomenon, including a continued focus on the roles of key stakeholders and clinical models that may further facilitate collaboration in treatment plans and recovery.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Fear of dementia is pervasive in older people with cognitive concerns. Much research is devoted to finding prognostic markers for dementia risk. Studies suggest apathy in older people may be prodromal to dementia and could be a relevant, easily measurable predictor of increased dementia risk. However, evidence is fragmented and methods vary greatly between studies.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the evidence for an association between apathy in dementia-free older individuals and incident dementia.
   DATA SOURCES Two reviewers conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO databases.
   STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria were (1) prospective cohort studies, (2) in general populations or memory clinic patients without dementia, (3) with clear definitions of apathy and dementia, and (4) reporting on the association between apathy and incident dementia.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes were pooled crude risk ratios, maximally adjusted reported hazard ratios (HR), and odds ratios (OR) using DerSimonian-Laird random effects models.
   RESULTS The mean age of the study populations ranged from 69.2 to 81.9 years (median, 71.6 years) and the percentage of women ranged from 35% to 70% (median, 53%). After screening 2031 titles and abstracts, 16 studies comprising 7365 participants were included. Apathy status was available for 7299 participants. Studies included populations with subjective cognitive concerns (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 11), cognitive impairment no dementia (n = 1), or mixed cognitive and no cognitive impairment (n = 2). Apathy was present in 1470 of 7299 participants (20.1%). Follow-up ranged from 1.2 to 5.4 years. In studies using validated apathy definitions (n = 12), the combined risk ratio of dementia for patients with apathy was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.32-2.50; I-2 = 76%; n = 12), the hazard ratio was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.27-4.51; I-2 = 90%; n = 7), and the odds ratio was 17.14 (95% CI, 1.91-154.0; I-2 = 60%; n = 2). Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and individual study results suggested the association between apathy and dementia weakened with increasing follow-up time, age, and cognitive impairment. Meta-regression adjusting for apathy definition and follow-up time explained 95% of heterogeneity in mild cognitive impairment.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Apathy was associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of dementia in memory clinic patients. Moderate publication bias may have inflated some of these estimates. Apathy deserves more attention as a relevant, cheap, noninvasive, and easily measureable marker of increased risk of incident dementia with high clinical relevance, particularly because these vulnerable patients may forgo health care.

AB  - Microglia are ramified cells that exhibit highly motile processes, which continuously survey the brain parenchyma and react to any insult to the CNS homeostasis. Although microglia have long been recognized as a crucial player in generating and maintaining inflammatory responses in the CNS, now it has become clear, that their function are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain. The innate immune response and phagocytosis represent only a little segment of microglia functional repertoire that also includes maintenance of biochemical homeostasis, neuronal circuit maturation during development and experience-dependent remodeling of neuronal circuits in the adult brain. Being equipped by numerous receptors and cell surface molecules microglia can perform bidirectional interactions with other cell types in the CNS. There is accumulating evidence showing that neurons inform microglia about their status and thus are capable of controlling microglial activation and motility while microglia also modulate neuronal activities. This review addresses the topic: how microglia communicate with other cell types in the brain, including fractalkine signaling, secreted soluble factors and extracellular vesicles. We summarize the current state of knowledge of physiological role and function of microglia during brain development and in the mature brain and further highlight microglial contribution to brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor as well as neuropsychiatric diseases (depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).

AB  - Background: Forensic psychiatric care treats mentally disordered offenders who suffer mainly from psychotic disorders, although comorbidities such as personality disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and substance abuse are common. A large proportion of these patients have committed violent crimes. Their care is involuntary, and their caregivers' mission is complex: not only to rehabilitate the patient, but also to consider their risk for reoffending and their risk to society. The objective of this overview of systematic reviews is to identify, appraise, and summarize the existing knowledge in forensic psychiatric care and identify knowledge gaps that require further research.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic literature search for systematic reviews in five defined domains considered important in daily clinical practice within the forensic psychiatric care: (1) diagnostic assessment and risk assessments; (2) pharmacological treatment; (3) psychological interventions; (4) psychosocial interventions, rehabilitation, and habilitation; and (5) restraint interventions. The target population was mentally disordered offenders (forensic psychiatric patients aged >15 years). Each abstract and full text review was assessed by two of the authors. Relevant reviews then were assessed for bias, and those with moderate or low risk of bias were included.
   Results: Of 38 systematic reviews meeting the inclusion criteria, only four had a moderate risk of bias. Two aimed to incorporate as many aspects of forensic psychiatric care as possible, one investigated non-pharmacological interventions to reduce aggression in forensic psychiatric care, and one focused on women with intellectual disabilities in forensic care. However, most of the primary studies included in these reviews had high risks of bias, and therefore, no conclusions could be drawn. All of our identified domains must be considered knowledge gaps.
   Conclusion: We could not answer any of our research questions within the five domains because of the high risk of bias in the primary studies in the included systematic reviews. There is an urgent need for more research on forensic psychiatric care since all of our studied domains were considered knowledge gaps.

AB  - Background: Further research gaps exist in relation to the promotion of breastfeeding. Robust scientific evidence obtained by a meta-analysis would provide objectively summarized data while enabling the assessment of consistency of findings. This review includes the first documented meta-analysis done on the effectiveness of targeting fathers for promoting breastfeeding (BF). Assessments have been done for a primary outcome and for six more secondary outcomes.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CENTRAL databases and unpublished researches were searched. Selections of randomized-controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were done in three rounds. Heterogeneity and potential publication bias were assessed. Eight studies were included in meta-analysis and others in narrative synthesis of the outcomes. Pooling was done with the Mental-Haenszel method using risk ratio (RR). Summary-of-Findings table was composed by Review-Manager (version 5.3) and GRADEproGDT applications. Subsequent sensitivity analysis was done.
   Results: Selected eight interventional studies included 1852 families. Exclusive BF at six months was significantly higher (RR = 2.04, CI = 1.58-2.65) in the intervention groups. The RR at 4 months was 1.52 (CI = 1.14 to 2.03). Risk of full-formula-feeding (RR = 0.69, CI = 0.52-0.93) and the occurrence of lactation-related problems were lower in the intervention groups (RR = 0.24, CI = 0.10-0.57). More likelihood of rendering support in BF-related issues was seen in intervention groups (RR = 1.43, CI = 1.22-1.68). Increase of maternal knowledge and favorable attitudes on BF were higher in the intervention groups (P <=; 0.001). The quality of evidence according to GRADE was "low" (for one outcome), "moderate" (for four outcomes), and "high" (for two outcomes).
   Conclusions: Targeting fathers in promotion of BF has provided favorable results for all seven outcomes with satisfactory quality of evidence.

AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R) are important drug targets for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Sig-1Rs are enriched in central nervous system (CNS). In addition to neurons, both cerebral microglia and astrocytes express Sig-1Rs. Activation of Sig-1Rs is known to elicit potent neuroprotective effects and promote neuronal survival via multiple mechanisms, including promoting mitochondrial functions, decreasing oxidative stress and regulating neuroimmnological functions. In this review article, we focus on the emerging role of Sig-1Rs in regulating neuroinflammation and discuss the recent advances on the Sig-1R-modulating neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology and therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - In Parkinson's disease, the progressive neurodegeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is associated with classic motor features, which typically have a focal onset. Since a defined somatotopic arrangement in the SNc has not been recognized, this focal motor onset is unexplained and hardly justified by current pathogenic theories of bottom-up disease progression (Braak's hypothesis, prionopathy). Here we propose that corticostriatal activity may represent a critical somatotopic "stressor'' for nigrostriatal terminals, ultimately driving retrograde nigrostriatal degeneration and leading to focal motor onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. As a pathogenic mechanism, corticostriatal activity may promote secretion of striatal extracellular alpha-synuclein, favoring its pathological aggregation at vulnerable dopaminergic synapses. A similar pathogenic process may occur at corticofugal projections to the medulla oblongata and other vulnerable structures, thereby contributing to the bottom-up progression of Lewy pathology. This cortical pathogenesis may co-exist with bottom-up mechanisms, adding an integrative top-down perspective to the quest for the factors that impinge upon the vulnerability of dopaminergic cells in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most frequent monogenic cause of syndromic autism spectrum disorders. The syndrome is caused by the loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a key RNA-binding protein involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology. Patients show intellectual disability, social deficits, repetitive behaviors and impairments in social communication. The aim of this review is to outline the importance of behavioral phenotyping of animal models of FXS from a developmental perspective, by showing how the behavioral characteristics of FXS at the clinical level can be translated into effective, developmentally-specific and clinically meaningful behavioral readouts in the laboratory setting. After introducing the behavioral features, diagnostic criteria and off-label pharmacotherapy of FXS, we outline how FXS-relevant behavioral features can be modelled in laboratory animals in the course of development: we review the progress to date, discuss how behavioral phenotyping in animal models of FXS is essential to identify potential treatments, and discuss caveats and future directions in this research field.

AB  - The current paper investigates the value and application of a range of physiological and neuroscientific techniques in applied marketing research and consumer science, highlighting new insights from research in social psychology and neuroscience. We review measures of sweat secretion, heart rate, facial muscle activity, eye movements, and electrical brain activity, using techniques including skin conductance, pupillometry, eyetracking, and magnetic brain imaging. For each measure, after a brief explanation of the underlying technique, we illustrate concepts and mechanisms that the measure allows researchers in marketing and consumer science to investigate, with a focus on consumer attitudes and behavior. By providing reviews on recent research that applied these methods in consumer science and relevant related fields, we also highlight methodological and theoretical strengths and limitations, with an emphasis on ecological validity. We argue that the inclusion of physiological and neuroscientific techniques can advance consumer research by providing insights into the often unconscious mechanisms underlying consumer behavior. Therefore, such technologies can help researchers and marketing practitioners understand the mechanisms of consumer behavior and improve predictions of consumer behavior.

AB  - Background: High-frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) is the most widely applied treatment protocol for major depressive disorder (MDD), while low-frequency (LF) rTMS over the right DLPFC (R-DLPFC) also exhibits similar, if not better, efficacy for MDD. Therefore, a meta-analysis is warranted to compare the efficacy of the two protocols for MDD.
   Method: We searched the literature from 1990 through to August 1, 2017 using MEDLINE, and the literature from 1995 through to August 1, 2017 using EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT). We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the efficacy of HF rTMS over the L-DLPFC and LF rTMS over the R-DLPFC for MDD, which used response and/or remission rates as the primary endpoints, with and without sham-controlled.
   Results: (1) The meta-analysis of the response rates was based on 12 studies, including 361 patients with MDD (175 for HF (> 5Hz) over the L-DLPFC, and 186 for LF (< 5Hz) over the R-DLPFC; odds ratio = 1.08; 95%, confidence interval = 0.88-1.34). (2) The meta-analysis of the remission rate was based on 5 studies, including 131 MDD patients (64 for HF over the L-DLPFC and 67 for LF over the R-DLPFC; odds ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 0.54-3.10).
   Conclusion: Both HF rTMS over the L-DLPFC and LF over the R-DLPFC demonstrated similar therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of patients with MDD. The results suggested that further investigation on treatment efficacy indicators before/during treatment is necessary and helpful for optimizing a personalized protocol for patients.

AB  - Acid-sensitive ion channels, such as amiloride-sensitive cation channel (ACCN), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) are highly related to the expression of fear and are expressed in several regions of the brain. These molecules can detect acidosis and maintain brain homeostasis. An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder (PD), with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger for panic attacks. To examine the effect of acid-sensitive channels on PD symptoms, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of these chemosensors in rodents and humans. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the Web of Science, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct, and SciELO databases. The review included original research in PD patients and animal models of PD that investigated acid-sensitive channels and PD symptoms. Studies without a control group, studies involving patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and in vitro studies were excluded. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The majority of the studies showed an association between panic symptoms and acid-sensitive channels. PD patients appear to display polymorphisms in the ACCN gene and elevated levels of TDAG8 mRNA. The results showed a decrease in panic-like symptoms after acid channel blockade in animal models. Despite the relatively limited data on this topic in the literature, our review identified evidence linking acid-sensitive channels to PD in humans and preclinical models. Future research should explore possible underlying mechanisms of this association, attempt to replicate the existing findings in larger populations, and develop new therapeutic strategies based on these biological features.

AB  - Adipose tissue is a dynamic organ with different effects on the body. Many of these effects are mediated by leptin, a hormone strongly involved in regulation of feeding and energy metabolism. It has an important role as a mediator of neuronal excitatory activity and higher brain functions. The aim of this study was to review the association between leptin and cerebral neuronal function, in particular its anticonvulsant or convulsant effects and the possible therapeutic role for treating epilepsy. For this purpose, the databases Pubmed, Science Direct, Elsevier, ResearchGate and Scielo were searched to identify experimental studies, reviews and systematic review articles, published in English, Spanish or Portuguese. Experimental studies and the presence of leptin receptors in nervous system sites other than the hypothalamus suggest an influence on higher brain functions. Indeed several animal studies have demonstrated a role of these channels in epileptiform activity as both anticonvulsive and convulsive effects have been found. The reason for these discrepancies is unclear but provides clear evidence of a potential role of leptin and leptin therapy in epileptiform activity. The association between leptin and brain function demonstrates the importance of peripheral metabolic hormones on central nervous system and opens a new way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in diseases like epilepsy. Nevertheless further investigations are important to clarify the dynamics and diverse actions of leptin on excitatory regulation in the brain.

AB  - Introduction
   Applying Design Thinking to health care could enhance innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness by increasing focus on patient and provider needs. The objective of this review is to determine how Design Thinking has been used in health care and whether it is effective.
   Methods
   We searched online databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PyscINFO) for articles published through March 31, 2017, using the terms "health," "health care," or "healthcare"; and "Design Thinking," "design science," "design approach," "user centered design," or "human centered design." Studies were included if they were written in English, were published in a peer-reviewed journal, provided outcome data on a health-related intervention, and used Design Thinking in intervention development, implementation, or both. Data were collected on target users, health conditions, intervention, Design Thinking approach, study design or sample, and health outcomes. Studies were categorized as being successful (all outcomes improved), having mixed success (at least one outcome improved), or being not successful (no outcomes improved).
   Results
   Twenty-four studies using Design Thinking were included across 19 physical health conditions, 2 mental health conditions, and 3 systems processes. Twelve were successful, 11 reported mixed success, and one was not successful. All 4 studies comparing Design Thinking interventions to traditional interventions showed greater satisfaction, usability, and effectiveness.
   Conclusion
   Design Thinking is being used in varied health care settings and conditions, although application varies. Design Thinking may result in usable, acceptable, and effective interventions, although there are methodological and quality limitations. More research is needed, including studies to isolate critical components of Design Thinking and compare Design Thinking-based interventions with traditionally developed interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Childhood trauma is a risk factor for the development of psychosis. Furthermore, a number of theories propose specific mechanisms by which childhood trauma may contribute to more severe positive and negative psychotic symptoms, some of which are supported empirically. The robustness of this empirical evidence is unclear due to mixed results and methodological limitations of individual studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for associations between childhood trauma and severity of hallucinations, delusions, and negative psychotic symptoms in clinical populations with a diagnosed psychotic disorder is needed. Method: A systematic search was conducted. Reference lists of relevant review articles were hand-searched, and authors contacted for data and additional unpublished studies. Study reporting bias and quality was assessed. Results: In total, 6667 studies were identified and of these 41 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 29 studies (4680 participants) were meta-analyzed. Among individuals with psychosis, childhood trauma was significantly correlated with severity of hallucinations (r = .199, P < .001) and delusions (r = .172, P < .001) but contrary to our hypothesis, not correlated with severity of negative symptoms (r = .049, P = .095). Severity of childhood neglect was correlated with negative symptoms (r = .142, P = .005). Conclusion: The results lend support for cognitive and biological theories that traumas in childhood may lead to hallucinations and delusions within psychotic disorders and have important implications for clinical practice.

AB  - Performance based assessment instruments have been employed in functional capacity measurement of mental disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the psychometric properties of the UCSD Performance-based Skill Assessment (UPSA). A search was conducted using the PRISMA protocol and 'UPSA' as key word term on electronic databases, with a date range for articles published from 2001-2017. Published studies involving community-dwelling adults were included. Pharmacological and/or clinical interventions involving clinical outcomes and/or institutionalized samples were excluded. Data related to construct validity, test-retest reliability and sensitivity/specificity were extracted, summarized and analyzed according to UPSA versions and psychiatric disorders. Fifty-eight studies including 8782 Community-dwelling adults met selection criteria. Data supporting the construct and known-groups validity were extracted from 41 studies involving Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders and 17 studies involving other metal illness. The UPSA was culturally adapted to 8 different languages and employed in 17 countries. Few studies reported sensitivity and specificity and the cut-off points could not be generalized. Moderate to strong evidence of construct validity and test-retest reliability was found. Few studies proposed cut-off points. The UPSA showed good psychometric properties in different versions including those culturally adapted.

AB  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a range of mental health, neurocognitive and functional problems. Although the diagnosis is based on descriptions of behaviour, individuals with ADHD characteristically describe excessive spontaneous mind wandering (MW). MW in individuals with ADHD reflects constant mental activity which lacks topic stability and content consistency. Based on this review of the neural correlates of ADHD and MW, we outline a new perspective on ADHD: the MW hypothesis. We propose that altered deactivation of the default mode network, and dysfunctional interaction with the executive control network, leads to excessive and spontaneous MW, which underpins symptoms and impairments of ADHD. We highlight that processes linked to the normal neural regulation of MW (context regulation, sensory decoupling, salience thresholds) are deficient in ADHD. MW-related measures could serve as markers of the disease process, as MW can be experimentally manipulated, as well as measured using rating scales, and experience sampling during both cognitive tasks and daily life. MW may therefore be a potential endophenotype.

AB  - Social support is demonstrated to have mixed effects on both pain and related physiological arousal. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to characterise these effects. A total of 2416 studies were identified in a systematic search, among which 21 were eligible for the quantitative review. The mere presence of another person was not sufficient to modulate pain perception. However, the presence of a stranger was identified to decrease pain-related arousal (SMD = -0.31), and the presence of a significant other increased facial expression of pain (SMD = 0.21). We further found verbal support to decrease pain (SMD = -0.69) and arousal (SMD = -0.99), and we demonstrated moderate to large analgesic effects of intimate relationships through touching (SMD = -0.95) and viewing (SMD = -0.60) of a romantic partner. Finally, we presented evidence of publication bias for pain-related arousal but not for behavioural pain outcomes. Together, our findings suggest that the impact of social support on pain is context-dependent with the verbal communication of support and intimate relationships being of particular importance.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to estimate the overall weighted mean effect of the relation between early language skills and later behavior problems in school-aged children. Method: A systematic literature search yielded 19,790 unduplicated reports, and a structured search strategy and identification procedure yielded 25 unique data sets, with 114 effect sizes for analysis. Eligible reports were then coded, and effect sizes were extracted and synthesized via robust variance estimation and random-effects meta-analytic techniques. Results: The overall correlation between early language and later behavior problems was negative and small (r = -.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-.16, -.11]), and controlling for demographic variables did not reduce the magnitude of the inverse relationship between language skill and problem behavior (r = -.16). Moderator analyses identified receptive language, parent-reported behavior measures, gender, and age as significant predictors of the association between language and behavior. Conclusion: This article corroborates the consistent findings of previous meta-analytic and longitudinal studies and further identifies areas, particularly around measurement, for future research. Furthermore, prospective longitudinal evaluations of the relations between language deficits and behavior problems with different types of measures (teacher-/parent-report, direct assessment, classroom observation) is warranted.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that allows for modulating the activity of local neural populations and related neural networks. TMS is touted as a viable intervention to normalize brain activity and alleviate some psychiatric symptoms. However, TMS interventions are known to be only moderately reliable, and the efficacy of such therapies remains to be proven for psychiatric disorders other than depression. We review new opportunities to personalize TMS interventions using neuroimaging and computational modeling, aiming to optimize treatment to suit particular individuals and clinical subgroups. Specifically, we consider the prospect of improving the efficacy of existing TMS interventions by parsing broad diagnostic categories into biologically and clinically homogeneous biotypes. Biotypes can provide distinct treatment targets for optimized TMS interventions. We further discuss the utility of computational models in refining TMS personalization and efficiently establishing optimal cortical targets for distinct biotypes. Personalizing cortical stimulation targets, treatment frequencies, and intensities can improve the therapeutic efficacy of TMS and potentially establish noninvasive brain stimulation as a viable treatment for psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder. The progression to pathological drug-seeking is thought to be driven by maladaptive learning processes which store and maintain associative memory, linking drug highs with cues and actions in the environment. These memories can encode Pavlovian associations which link predictive stimuli (e.g., people, places, and paraphernalia) with a hedonic drug high, as well as instrumental learning about the actions required to obtain drug-associated incentives. Learned memories are not permanent however, and much recent interest has been generated in exploiting the process of reconsolidation to erase or significantly weaken maladaptive memories to treat several mental health disorders, including addictions. Normally reconsolidation serves to update and maintain the adaptive relevance of memories, however administration of amnestic agents within the critical "reconsolidation window" can weaken or even erase maladaptive memories. Here we discuss recent advances in the field, including ongoing efforts to translate preclinical reconsolidation research in animal models into clinical practice.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, debilitating and sometimes deadly consequence of exposure to severe psychological trauma. Although effective treatments exist for some individuals, they are limited. New approaches to intervention, treatment and prevention are therefore much needed. In the past few years, the field has rapidly developed a greater understanding of the dysfunctional brain circuits underlying PTSD, a shift in understanding that has been made possible by technological revolutions that have allowed the observation and perturbation of the macrocircuits and microcircuits thought to underlie PTSD-related symptoms. These advances have allowed us to gain a more translational knowledge of PTSD, have provided further insights into the mechanisms of risk and resilience and offer promising avenues for therapeutic discovery.

The main purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of the association between Internet addiction (IA) and a number of personal and social psychological factors in adolescents.
   Methods: The search included cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies which analyzed the relationship between IA and at least one of the following personal variables: (i) psychopathology, (ii) personality features and (iii) social difficulties, as well as (iv) self-esteem, (v) social skills and (vi) positive family functioning. These variables were classified as protective and promoting factors of the risk of developing IA.
   Results: A total of 28 studies with adequate methodological quality were identified in the primary medical, health and psychological literature databases up to November 2017. Of the 48,090 students included in the analysis, 6548 (13.62%) were identified as excessive Internet users. The results highlight that risk factors had a greater effect on IA than protective factors. Also, personal factors showed a greater link with IA than social factors.
   Conclusions: The data provide relevant information for those developing programs for the prevention of IA and the enhancement of protective factors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is characterized by acute headache, visual impairment, seizures, and altered mental status; neuroimaging may show cerebral edema affecting the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in eclampsia. Literature was searched from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The search terms included "eclampsia", "eclampsia and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome", and "pregnancy and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome". We reviewed all published original articles with the search term "posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome". Up to 100% of eclamptic patients may have reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Two putative mechanisms - "vasogenic" and "vasospasm" - are considered to be responsible. Cerebral edema and petechial cortical hemorrhages are common autopsy findings. Clinical and neuroimaging manifestations are reversible in the majority of patients. Prompt correction of increased blood pressure and treatment of seizures are the cornerstones of treatment. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for seizures. Some survivors may have permanent vision loss and other disabling sequelae. In conclusion, posterior reversible encephalopathy is a devastating complication of eclampsia. Early recognition helps in preventing some of its devastating sequelae.

AB  - Available meta-analyses point to a significant association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. The possible mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. Here, we overview the studies aimed at identifying the factors contributing to the comorbidity between ADHD and obesity, including genetic factors, fetal programming, executive dysfunctions, psychosocial stress, factors directly related to energy balance, and sleep patterns alterations. The bulk of current research has focused on reduced physical activity and abnormal eating patterns as possible causes of weight gain in individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to explore the specific role of executive dysfunctions. None of the available published studies have evaluated physiological mechanisms such as hormonal and metabolic disorders or inappropriate neurobiological regulation of appetite. Research exploring the genetic basis for the coexistence of ADHD and obesity and epigenetic mechanisms, with particular emphasis on stress, both pre- and postnatal, seems particularly promising. Here, we propose a biopsychosocial model to integrate current findings and move the field forward to gain insight into the ADHD-obesity relationship.

AB  - The emphasis on social-emotional competence and its importance to positive academic and nonacademic outcomes has led to a focus on identifying and implementing effective practices for supporting young children's social-emotional competence. Our work to identify, validate, and support the fidelity of implementation of evidence-based practices to promote young children's social-emotional competence and to address challenging behavior has focused on the Pyramid Model for Promoting Social-Emotional Competence in Infants and Young Children framework (Fox et al. in Infants Young Child 23:3-14, 2010; Hemmeter et al. in Sch Psychol Rev 35:583-601, 2006; Hemmeter et al., in: Buysse, Peisner-Feinberg (eds) Handbook of response-to-intervention in early childhood, Brookes, Baltimore, 2013). The implementation of the Pyramid Model practices to provide effective intervention that leads to meaningful child outcomes will require that practitioners are able to implement the practices with fidelity. Implementation science provides guidance on the "drivers" or key components that must be in place within a system to ensure the use of evidence-practices or interventions (Blase et al. in stages of implementation analysis: where are we? FPG Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 2013; Metz et al. in an integrated stage-based framework for implementation of early childhood programs and systems. OPRE Research Brief OPRE 201548, 2015). In this paper, we address competency drivers by describing an instrument that has been developed, validated, and used to measure the fidelity with which practitioners implement Pyramid Model practices. In addition, we describe the professional development intervention we have used to support teachers to implement the practices with fidelity. We focus on how a fidelity tool can be used to measure practice implementation as well as to guide professional development focused on the practices.

AB  - Since the mid-twentieth century, numerous vertebrates and invertebrates have been used as model organisms and become indispensable tools for exploring a broad range of biological and ecological processes. Crayfish seem to be adequate models which resulted in their involvement in research. In the two decades since its discovery, ongoing research has confirmed that the marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis Lyko, 2017) is an ideal taxon in this regard, especially due to its almost continuous asexual reproduction providing a source of genetically identical offspring. This review provides an overview of the occurrence, biology, ecology, ethology, and human exploitation of marbled crayfish with primary focus on its use as a laboratory model organism as well as potential risks to native biota in case of its introduction. Genetic uniformity, ease of culture, and a broad behaviour repertoire fosters the use of marbled crayfish in epigenetics and developmental biology, as well as physiological, ecotoxicological, and ethological research. Marbled crayfish could be further exploited for basic and applied fields of science such as evolutionary biology and clonal tumour evolution. However, due to its high invasive potential in freshwater environments security measures must be taken to prevent its escape into the wild.

AB  - Phytoremediation is the bioremediation of contaminated soils and waters by using plants and their associated microorganisms. Phytoremediation of heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soils is based on immobilization of metals in rhizosphere soil and roots (phytostabilization) and on mobilization, uptake, and transfer of metals into the aboveground plant organs (phytoextraction). In this review, we aimed to (i) discuss the fundamentals, potential, and limitations of plant-associated microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) to increase the efficiency of phytostabilization and phytoextraction of HM-contaminated soils and (ii) describe promising developments and future challenges to expanding their use. Controlled inoculations of plants with growth-promoting microorganisms can significantly increase their root growth, biomass production, and stress tolerance in HM-contaminated soils. A serious weakness of phytoremediation in general is the usually high and difficult to measure expenditure of time for successful completion. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and the translocation factors (TFs) are among the most important measures of the efficiency of phytoremediation. However, an overview of BCFs and TFs for a variety of combinations of plants with defined associated microorganisms is lacking. Moreover, the joint evaluation of model systems would allow an improved cost-benefit calculation of microbial inoculations in phytoremediation systems. For this purpose, the use of in vitro model systems is considered to be preferable to field experiments due to the savings in time and costs and the control of environmental conditions. However, the transferability of in vitro data to field conditions is limited. Currently, attention is focused on the use of artificial neural networks, mainly to avoid formulating any complex relationships between soil inputs (e.g., soil amendments, pH, carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen contents, electrical conductivity, and dissolved organic carbon) and design outputs (e.g., BCFs and TFs) beforehand and because of the high accuracy of the obtained models. The controlled use of associated microorganisms to increase the efficiency of phytoremediation of HM, mainly using combinations of Brassica and Salix spp. and rhizobacteria at contaminated soils, is a promising possibility. A crucial future challenge for the expansion of their use will be to develop well-defined cost-and time-efficient tools for a credible prediction of their effectiveness on contaminated field sites.

AB  - Psychiatric prognosis is a difficult problem. Making a prognosis requires looking far into the future, as opposed to making a diagnosis, which is concerned with the current state. During the follow-up period, many factors will influence the course of the disease. Combined with the usually scarcer longitudinal data and the variability in the definition of outcomes/transition, this makes prognostic predictions a challenging endeavor. Employing neuroimaging data in this endeavor introduces the additional hurdle of high dimensionality. Machine learning techniques are especially suited to tackle this challenging problem. This review starts with a brief introduction to machine learning in the context of its application to clinical neuroimaging data. We highlight a few issues that are especially relevant for prediction of outcome and transition using neuroimaging. We then review the literature that discusses the application of machine learning for this purpose. Critical examination of the studies and their results with respect to the relevant issues revealed the following: 1) there is growing evidence for the prognostic capability of machine learning-based models using neuroimaging; and 2) reported accuracies may be too optimistic owing to small sample sizes and the lack of independent test samples. Finally, we discuss options to improve the reliability of (prognostic) prediction models. These include new methodologies and multimodal modeling. Paramount, however, is our conclusion that future work will need to provide properly (cross-)validated accuracy estimates of models trained on sufficiently large datasets. Nevertheless, with the technological advances enabling acquisition of large databases of patients and healthy subjects, machine learning represents a powerful tool in the search for psychiatric biomarkers.

AB  - Since last decade, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) technology has evidently revolutionized our digital world. It uses electromagnetic frequency radiations (EMFr), ranging 850-1900 MHz, and is being composed of three main units (i.e., mobile station, access and core networks). GSM technology has significant impact on our daily life as revealed by increased number of mobile users in the world over. The main goal of the present review is to critically revisit the available literature regarding the responses of various flowering plant species towards GSM and GSM-like radiations using physiological, biochemical, molecular and cytological markers using in vitro approaches. Different monocots (tomato, onion, wheat and maize etc.) and dicots (pulses, mustard and flax) have been studied using both GSM mobile phone and GSM simulators. Different studies revealed overall reductions in germination, root-shoot lengths, dry weight, in both dose and time-dependent manners. However, there could be found incline in various parameters at biochemical and molecular levels. Furthermore, there could be found disturbances at cytological levels upon exposure of roots of onion to EMFr radiations. The overall literature review shows the negative effects of GSM and GSM-like radiations on targeted plant species. In order to alleviate the stressful effects of EMFr radiations on plants, in vivo studies need to be done using various cost-effective approaches such as use of biochar and various organic amendments.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is a major global health problem and commercial drivers are particularly exposed to it. As no systematic assessment of the health risks associated with occupational exposure to ambient air pollution in this population had yet been carried out, we conducted a systematic review using a protocol-driven strategy. Papers published from inception to April 20, 2018 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, African journals online, the Cochrane library, ISRCTN WHO ICTRP, and the Web of Science and Scopus databases were screened for inclusion by two independent reviewers. Original articles with at least an available abstract in English or French were included. The initial search retrieved 1454 published articles of which 20 articles were included. Three studies reported a significant difference in white blood cells (10(6)/L) among commercial motorcyclists compared to rural inhabitants (5.041 +/- 1.209 vs. 5.900 +/- 1.213, p = 0.001), an increased risk of lung cancer (RR = 1.6, 95%CI 1.5-1.8) in bus drivers and an increased standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in bus drivers from Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR 2.17, 95%CI 1.19-3.87) compared to white-collar workers. Other studies also found that drivers had more oxidative DNA damage and chromosome breaks. Four papers failed to demonstrate that the drivers were more exposed to air pollution than the controls. Three other studies also reported no significant difference in lung function parameters and respiratory symptoms. The genetic polymorphisms of detoxifying enzymes were also not homogeneously distributed compared to the controls. There is some evidence that occupational exposure to ambient air pollution among commercial drivers is associated with adverse health outcomes, but the existing literature is limited, with few studies on small sample size, methodological weaknesses, and contradictory findingsthus, further research is recommended.

AB  - This article analyzes whether psychiatric disorders can be considered different from non-psychiatric disorders on a nosologic or semiologic point of view. The supposed difference between psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders relates to the fact that the individuation of psychiatric disorders seems more complex than for non-psychiatric disorders. This individuation process can be related to nosologic and semiologic considerations. The first part of the article analyzes whether the ways of constructing classifications of psychiatric disorders are different than for non-psychiatric disorders. The ways of establishing the boundaries between the normal and the pathologic, and of classifying the signs and symptoms in different categories of disorder, are analyzed. Rather than highlighting the specificity of psychiatric disorders, nosologic investigation reveals conceptual notions that apply to the entire field of medicine when we seek to establish the boundaries between the normal and the pathologic and between different disorders. Psychiatry is thus very important in medicine because it exemplifies the inherent problem of the construction of cognitive schemes imposed on clinical and scientific medical information to delineate a classification of disorders and increase its comprehensibility and utility. The second part of this article assesses whether the clinical manifestations of psychiatric disorders (semiology) are specific to the point that they are entities that are different from non-psychiatric disorders. The attribution of clinical manifestations in the different classifications (Research Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic Statistic Manual, Research Domain Criteria) is analyzed. Then the two principal models on signs and symptoms, i.e. the latent variable model and the causal network model, are assessed. Unlike nosologic investigation, semiologic analysis is able to reveal specific psychiatric features in a patient. The challenge, therefore, is to better define and classify signs and symptoms in psychiatry based on a dual and mutually interactive biological and psychological perspective, and to incorporate semiologic psychiatry into an integrative, multilevel and multisystem brain and cognitive approach.

AB  - The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory that "kidneys give rise to marrow, and the brain is the sea of marrow" has been a guide for the clinical application of kidney, qi and blood tonics for prevention and treatment of dementia and improvement in memory. As low resistance end-organs, both the brain and the kidneys are subjected to blood flow of high volumes throughout the cardiac cycle. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are two common causes of dementia, and it is increasingly recognized that many older adults with dementia have both AD and vascular pathologies. The underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood, but may involve atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, history of cardiac disease and possibly, kidney dysfuntion, leading to reduced erythropoietin production, anemia, brain energy deficit and slow excitotoxicity. During the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jing-Yue used Qi Fu Yin (seven blessings decoction), comprising Panax ginseng, Rehmannia glutinosa, Angelica polymorpha, Atractylodes macrocephala, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Ziziphus jujube, and Polygala tenuifolia to boost qi and blood circulation, strengthen the heart, and calm the spirit-skillfully linking heart, spleen, kidney, qi, blood and brain as a whole to treat age-related dementia. The purpose of this review is to outline TCM concepts for the treatment of dementia and illustrated with a historical prescription for the treatment of the condition, with the hope that this description may lead to advances in its management.

AB  - Cyberbullying is an important phenomenon but to date there exists no universally accepted definition. This leads to a variety of Definitions and conceptualizations, making it almost impossible to generalize their results. The purposes of this paper are 1) to present the current state of definitions, 2) to define cyberbullying based on a concept analysis), 3) to illustrate relationships between defining attributes and other possible influencing factors, and 4) to discuss which characteristics should be considered in the valuation of a cyberbullying incident. Therefore, definitions that emerged between 2012 and 2017 were analyzed. A systematic literature search resulted in 24 definitions for qualitative synthesis. Descriptive analysis revealed five defining attributes of cyberbullying that were shared across all identified definitions. Overall, 15 characteristics were determined to describe the phenomenon. A definition is proposed, and additional influencing factors are discussed. Our results suggest that there exist five main defining attributes of cyberbullying which a variety of researchers use to define cyberbullying. Future research should conduct more qualitative studies with adolescents in order to validate these attributes. If researchers and adolescents share the same understanding, the proposed definition can be used in future studies, making their findings more comparable to each other.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for depressive disorder. Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic. However, ketamine cautiously needs to be administered in ECT due to the possibility of increased risk of side effects.

AB  - Age related neurodegenerative disorders (ARND) are presented as the most debilitating and challenging diseases associated with the central nervous system. Despite the advent of active molecules with a positive role on neurodegenerative mechanisms, many of the current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective in treating or preventing ARND. Lipid nanocarriers have emerged as efficient delivery systems with the capability to cross biological barriers, especially the blood brain barrier (BBB). Also, when associated to natural compounds, lipid nanocarriers have demonstrated to be an interesting alternative to ARND therapies with multiple beneficial effects. This comprehensive review focus on state-of-the-art lipid based nanocarriers for the delivery of natural compounds targeting neurodegeneration. A critical analysis of published reports will be also provided giving indications to researchers about the most promising ARND nanotherapy strategies.

AB  - Human-induced global change is expected to amplify the disease risk for marine biota. However, the role of disease in the rapid global decline of seagrass is largely unknown. Global change may enhance seagrass susceptibility to disease through enhanced physiological stress, while simultaneously promoting pathogen development. This review outlines the characteristics of disease-forming organisms and potential impacts of global change on three groups of known seagrass pathogens: labyrinthulids, oomycetes and Phytomyxea. We propose that hypersalinity, climate warming and eutrophication pose the greatest risk for increasing frequency of disease outbreaks in seagrasses by increasing seagrass stress and lowering seagrass resilience. In some instances, global change may also promote pathogen development. However, there is currently a paucity of information on these seagrass pathosystems. We emphasise the need to expand current research to better understand the seagrass-pathogen relationships, serving to inform predicative modelling and management of seagrass disease under future global change scenarios.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder is chronic and debilitating. Studies investigating resting-state functional connectivity in individuals with bipolar disorder may help to inform neurobiological models of illness. Methods: We conducted a systematic review with the following goals: to summarize the literature on resting-state functional connectivity in bipolar disorder during clinical remission (euthymia) compared with healthy controls; to critically appraise the literature and research gaps; and to propose directions for future research. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and grey literature up to April 2017. Results: Twenty-three studies were included. The most consistent finding was the absence of differences in resting-state functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN) and salience network (SN) between people with bipolar disorder and controls, using independent component analysis. However, 2 studies in people with bipolar disorder who were positive for psychosis history reported DMN hypoconnectivity. Studies using seed-based analysis largely reported aberrant resting-state functional connectivity with the amygdala, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex in people with bipolar disorder compared with controls. Few studies used regional homogeneity or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Limitations: We found heterogeneity in the analysis methods used. Conclusion: Stability of the DMN, FPN and SN may reflect a state of remission. Further, DMN hypoconnectivity may reflect a positive history of psychosis in patients with bipolar disorder compared with controls, highlighting a potentially different neural phenotype of psychosis in people with bipolar disorder. Resting-state functional connectivity changes between the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex may reflect a neural correlate of subthreshold symptoms experienced in bipolar disorder euthymia, the trait-based pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and/or a compensatory mechanism to maintain a state of euthymia.

AB  - Alongside the exponential flourish of research on age-related trajectories of human brain development during childhood and adolescence in the past two decades, there has been an increase in the body of work examining the association between pubertal development and brain maturation. This review systematically examines empirical research on puberty-related structural and functional brain development in humans, with the aim of identifying convergent patterns of associations. We emphasize longitudinal studies, and discuss pervasive but oft-overlooked methodological issues that may be contributing to inconsistent findings and hindering progress (e.g., conflating distinct pubertal indices and different measurement instruments). We also briefly evaluate support for prominent models of adolescent neurodevelopment that hypothesize puberty-related changes in brain regions involved in affective and motivational processes. For the field to progress, replication studies are needed to help resolve current inconsistencies and gain a clearer understanding of pubertal associations with brain development in humans, knowledge that is crucial to make sense of the changes in psychosocial functioning, risk behavior, and mental health during adolescence.

AB  - In 2007, supplementation with the trace element selenium in a trial was unexpectedly found to be associated with an excess risk of type 2 diabetes. Given the concerns raised by these findings and the large number of recent studies on this topic, we reviewed the available literature with respect to this possible association. In this paper, we assessed the results of both experimental and nonexperimental epidemiologic studies linking selenium with type 2 diabetes incidence. Through a systematic literature search, we retrieved 50 potentially eligible nonexperimental studies and 5 randomized controlled trials published through June 11, 2018. To elucidate the possible dose-response relation, we selected for further analysis those studies that included multiple exposure levels and serum or plasma levels. We computed a pooled summary risk ratio (RR) of diabetes according to selenium exposure in these studies. We also computed a RR for diabetes incidence following supplementation with 200 mu g/day of selenium compared with placebo in trials. In the nonexperimental studies, we found a direct relation between selenium exposure and risk of diabetes, with a clear and roughly linear trend in subjects with higher plasma or serum selenium levels, with RR at 140 mu g/L of selenium exposure compared with a referent category of<45 mu g/L equal to 3.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-9.4]. A dose-response meta-analysis focusing on studies with direct assessment of dietary selenium intake showed a similar trend. In experimental studies, selenium supplementation increased the risk of diabetes by 11% (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22) compared with the placebo-allocated participants, with a higher RR in women than in men. Overall, results from both nonexperimental and experimental studies indicate that selenium may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes across a wide range of exposure levels. The relative increase in risk is small but of possible public health importance because of the high incidence of diabetes and the ubiquity of selenium exposure.

AB  - A large body of research indicates that ketamine is safe and well tolerated at sub-anesthetic doses and shows potential as a novel antidepressant. However, the effect of single infusions of ketamine, although reliably replicated and effective in relieving depressive symptoms, is transient, with relapse occurring within 2 weeks of treatment. Recent studies have focused on identifying a safe and effective ketamine administration protocol for the rapid and sustained relief of depressive symptoms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted (for studies from January 2010 to April 2018 that administered intravenous ketamine in multiple infusions) and a total of 17 studies meeting criteria were included in this review. We enumerate principle points of studies that administered multiple infusions of ketamine and followed patients over a longer period of time. We also identify the pressing need for additional research to fill in the gaps that exist around appropriate dosage regimens and an effective maintenance strategy.

AB  - Microglia, often described as the brain-resident macrophages, play crucial roles in central nervous system development, maintenance, plasticity, and adaptation to the environment. Both aging and chronic stress promote microglial morphological and functional changes, which can lead to the development of brain pathologies including Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, aging, and chronic stress represent main environmental risk factors for PD. In these conditions, microglia are known to undergo different morphological and functional changes. Inflammation is an important component of PD and disequilibrium between pro-and anti-inflammatory microglial functions might constitute a crucial component of PD onset and progression. Cumulated data also suggest that, during PD, microglia might lose beneficial functions and gain detrimental ones, in addition to mediating inflammation. In this mini-review, we aim to summarize the literature discussing the functional and morphological changes that microglia undergo in PD pathophysiology and upon exposure to its two main environmental risk factors, aging, and chronic stress.

AB  - The Big-fish-little-Pond effect is well acknowledged as the negative effect of class/school average achievement on student academic self-concept, which profoundly impacts student academic performance and mental development. Although a few studies have been done with regard to this effect, inconsistence exists in the effect size with little success in finding moderators. Here, we present a meta-analysis to synthesize related literatures to reach a summary conclusion on the BFLPE. Furthermore, student age, comparison target, academic self-concept domain, student location, sample size, and publication year were examined as potential moderators. Thirty-three studies with fifty-six effect sizes (total N = 1,276,838) were finally included. The random effects model led to a mean of the BFLPE at beta = -0.28 (p < 0.001). Moreover, moderator analyses revealed that the Big-Fish-Little-Pond effect is an age-based process and an intercultural phenomenon, which is stronger among high school students, in Asia and when verbal self-concept is considered. This meta-analysis is the first quantitative systematic overview of BFLPE, whose results are valuable to the understanding of BFLPE and reveal the necessity for educators from all countries to learn about operative means to help students avoid the potential negative effect. Future research expectations are offered subsequently.

AB  - Glutamate receptors play a crucial role in the central nervous system and are implicated in different brain disorders. They play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although many studies on NDDs have been conducted, their exact pathophysiological characteristics are still not fully understood. In in vivo and in vitro models of neurotoxic-induced NDDs, neurotoxic agents are used to induce several neuronal injuries for the purpose of correlating them with the pathological characteristics of NDDs. Moreover, therapeutic drugs might be discovered based on the studies employing these models. In NDD models, different neurotoxic agents, namely, kainic acid, domoic acid, glutamate, beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine, amyloid beta, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, rotenone, 3-Nitropropionic acid and methamphetamine can potently impair both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, leading to the progression of toxicity. Many other neurotoxic agents mainly affect the functions of ionotropic glutamate receptors. We discuss particular neurotoxic agents that can act upon glutamate receptors so as to effectively mimic NDDs. The correlation of neurotoxic agent-induced disease characteristics with glutamate receptors would aid the discovery and development of therapeutic drugs for NDDs.

AB  - In this paper, we outline several recent insights for the priorities and challenges for future research for reducing phosphorus (P) based water eutrophication in the agricultural landscapes of Northwest Europe. We highlight that new research efforts best be focused on headwater catchments as they are a key influence on the initial chemistry of the larger river catchments, and here many management interventions are most effectively made. We emphasize the lack of understanding on how climate change will impact on P losses from agricultural landscapes. Particularly, the capability to disentangle current and future trends in P fluxes, due to climate change itself, from climate driven changes in agricultural management practices and P inputs. Knowing that, future climatic change trajectories for Western Europe will accelerate the release of the most bioavailable soil P. We stress the ambiguities created by the large varieties of sources and storage/transfer processes involved in P emissions in landscapes and the need to develop specific data treatment methods or tracers able to circumvent them, thereby helping catchment managers to identify the ultimate P sources that most contribute to diffuse P emissions. We point out that soil and aqueous P exist not only in various chemical forms, but also in range of less considered physical forms e. g., dissolved, nanoparticulate, colloidal and other particulates, all affected differently by climate as well as other environmental factors, and require bespoke mitigation measures. We support increased high resolution monitoring of headwater catchments, to not only help verify the effectiveness of catchments mitigation strategies, but also add data to further develop new water quality models (e.g., those include Fe-P interactions) which can deal with climate and land use change effects within an uncertainty framework. We finally conclude that there is a crucial need for more integrative research efforts to deal with our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and processes associated with the identification of critical source areas, P mobilization, delivery and biogeochemical processing, as otherwise even highintensity and high-resolution research efforts will only reveal an incomplete picture of the full global impact of the terrestrial derived P on downstream aquatic and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Background: Internet-supported mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly being used to support people with a chronic condition. Characteristics of MBIs vary greatly in their mode of delivery, communication patterns, level of facilitator involvement, intervention period, and resource intensity, making it difficult to compare how individual digital features may optimize intervention adherence and outcomes.
   Objective: The aims of this review were to (1) provide a description of digital characteristics of internet-supported MBIs and examine how these relate to evidence for efficacy and adherence to the intervention and (2) gain insights into the type of information available to inform translation of internet-supported MBIs to applied settings.
   Methods: MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies assessing an MBI delivered or accessed via the internet and engaging participants in daily mindfulness-based activities such as mindfulness meditations and informal mindfulness practices. Only studies using a comparison group of alternative interventions (active compactor), usual care, or wait-list were included. Given the broad definition of chronic conditions, specific conditions were not included in the original search to maximize results. The search resulted in 958 articles, from which 11 articles describing 10 interventions met the inclusion criteria.
   Results: Internet-supported MBIs were more effective than usual care or wait-list groups, and self-guided interventions were as effective as facilitator-guided interventions. Findings were informed mainly by female participants. Adherence to interventions was inconsistently defined and prevented robust comparison between studies. Reporting of factors associated with intervention dissemination, such as population representativeness, program adoption and maintenance, and costs, was rare.
   Conclusions: More comprehensive descriptions of digital characteristics need to be reported to further our understanding of features that may influence engagement and behavior change and to improve the reproducibility of MBIs. Gender differences in determinants and patterns of health behavior should be taken into account at the intervention design stage to accommodate male and female preferences. Future research could compare MBIs with established evidence-based therapies to identify the population groups that would benefit most from internet-supported programs.

AB  - Practice of endurance sports/activities has gained most devotees over recent decades, thanks to its capacity to maintain and improve health. However, their characteristics and accessibility have facilitated the emergence of addictive behaviors. Excessive practicing can lead to adverse physical and psychological effects seriously prejudicial to health, to the extent that individuals are unable to control this behavior. Recognizing that exercise addiction is still a controversial concept, the aim of the present review is to analyze the state of research into addictive exercise behaviors, specifically centering on running and endurance sports. To this end, a search covering article written in English and dated from 2010 onward was carried out in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCOhost databases. Of a total of 2,675 articles in the four databases, 25 were eligible for the final review. The studies reviewed confirmed that excessive practice could encourage the appearance of addictive behaviors and health problems. Most research has reported no age or sex differences in exercise dependence among endurance sport practitioners; however, obsessive passion and dedication to sports activities may be predictors for addiction to exercise. Owing to terminological confusion and the variety of tools used to measure addiction, figures for prevalence differ widely among studies, with values quoted ranging from 3 to 42%. Furthermore, it is clear that there are problems in delimiting, defining and diagnosing this sort of behavior, which has led to addiction to exercise not yet being considered a behavioral disorder.

AB  - Background: Police mental health street triage is an increasingly common intervention when dealing with police incidents in which there is a suspected mental health component. We conducted a systematic review of street triage interventions with three aims. First, to identify papers reporting on models of co-response police mental health street triage. Second, to identify the characteristics of service users who come in to contact with these triage services. Third, to evaluate the effectiveness of co-response triage services.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review. We searched the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, Scopus, Thompson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection, The Cochrane Library, ProQuest National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, EThoS, and OpenGrey. We searched reference and citation lists. We also searched for other grey literature through Google, screening the first 100 PDFs of each of our search terms. We performed a narrative synthesis of our results.
   Results: Our search identified 11,553 studies. After screening, 26 were eligible. Over two-thirds (69%) had been published within the last 3 years. We did not identify any randomised control trials. Results indicated that street triage might reduce the number of people taken to a place of safety under S136 of the Mental Health Act where that power exists, or reduce the use of police custody in other jurisdictions.
   Conclusions: There remains a lack of evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of street triage and the characteristics, experience, and outcomes of service users. There is also wide variation in the implementation of the co-response model, with differences in hours of operation, staffing, and incident response.

AB  - Background: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] is an innovative, evidence-based and effective psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action.
   Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning.
   Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy.
   Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EDMR therapy is still in its infancy. Studies in well-defined clinical and non-clinical populations, larger sample sizes and tighter methodological control are further needed in order to establish firm conclusions.

AB  - Collective trauma is a cataclysmic event that shatters the basic fabric of society. Aside from the horrific loss of life, collective trauma is also a crisis of meaning. The current paper systematically delineates the process that begins with a collective trauma, transforms into a collective memory, and culminates in a system of meaning that allows groups to redefine who they are and where they are going. For victims, the memory of trauma may be adaptive for group survival, but also elevates existential threat, which prompts a search for meaning, and the construction of a trans-generational collective self. For perpetrators, the memory of trauma poses a threat to collective identity that may be addressed by denying history, minimizing culpability for wrongdoing, transforming the memory of the event, closing the door on history, or accepting responsibility. The acknowledgment of responsibility often comes with disidentification from the group. The dissonance between historical crimes and the need to uphold a positive image of the group may be resolved, however, in another manner; it may prompt the creation of a new group narrative that acknowledges the crime and uses it as a backdrop to accentuate the current positive actions of the group. For both victims and perpetrators, deriving meaning from trauma is an ongoing process that is continuously negotiated within groups and between groups; it is responsible for debates over memory, but also holds the promise of providing a basis for intergroup understanding.

AB  - Brain functional imaging data, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, have been employed to reflect functional integration of the brain. Alteration in brain functional connectivity (FC) is expected to provide potential biomarkers for classifying or predicting brain disorders. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review in order to provide guidance about the available brain FC measures and typical classification strategies. We survey the state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static functional connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of interest (ROIs), data-driven spatial network and functional network connectivity (FNC) are often computed to reflect SFC from different angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a sliding-window framework, and intrinsic connectivity states along the time-varying connectivity patterns are typically extracted using clustering or decomposition approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches. Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection including the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model building, we include traditional classifiers as well as more recently applied deep learningmethods. Moreover, we review representative applications with remarkable classification accuracy for psychosis and mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and neurological disorders using fMRI data. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed. Finally, challenges in the field are pointed out with respect to the inaccurate diagnosis labeling, the abundant number of possible features and the difficulty in validation. Some suggestions for future work are also provided.

AB  - The combination of genetics and genomics in Parkinson ' s disease has recently begun to unveil molecular mechanisms possibly underlying disease onset and progression. In particular, catabolic processes such as autophagy have been increasingly gaining relevance as post-mortem evidence and experimental models suggested a participation in neurodegeneration and alpha-synuclein Lewy body pathology. In addition, familial Parkinson ' s disease linked to LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein provided stronger correlation between etiology and alterations in autophagy. More detailed cellular pathways are proposed and genetic risk factors that associate with idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease provide further clues in dissecting contributions of single players. Nevertheless, the fine-tuning of these processes remains elusive, as the initial stages of the pathways are not yet clarified.
   In this review, we collect literature evidence pointing to autophagy as the common, downstream target of Parkinsonian dysfunctions and augment current knowledge on the factors that direct the subsequent steps. Cell and molecular biology evidence indicate that p38 signaling underlies neurodegeneration and autoptic observations suggest a participation in neuropathology. Moreover, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 also appear involved in the p38 pathway with additional roles in the regulation of GTPase signaling. Small GTPases are critical modulators of p38 activation and thus, their functional interaction with aSyn and LRRK2 could explain much of the detailed mechanics of autophagy in Parkinson ' s disease.
   We propose a novel hypothesis for a more comprehensive working model where autophagy is controlled by upstream pathways, such as GTPase-p38, that have been so far underexplored in this context. In addition, etiological factors (LRRK2, alpha-synuclein) and risk loci might also combine in this common mechanism, providing a powerful experimental setting to dissect the cause of both familial and idiopathic disease.

   Recent Findings Exposure-based CBT is a well-established intervention. Different research groups have found positive evidence to augment CBT by evaluating inhibitory learning principles, the role of parents in child treatment, an individualized case formulation, computer and online forms of CBT, and virtual and augmented reality systems for exposure practice. Specific programs have been developed to meet specific needs of preschoolers, adolescents, and children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder and anxiety.
   Summary Successful adaptations to CBT exist and the field should continue to improve the generalizability, feasibility, and expected benefit of CBT to improve its effectiveness.

AB  - Due to unique chemical and physical properties, nanomaterials from the Graphene family are being increasingly introduced in all fields of science. The specific roles they can occupy within different applications are attracting increased attention by several industrial sectors. These carbon nanoparticles are released into the environment especially accumulating in aquatic systems. Since the discovery of graphene, a number of research actives are being conducted to find out the toxic potential of the Graphene family materials to different organism's models. Although their toxicity effects are well described for biomedical applications, few data were produced with the specific aim of assessing the toxic effects of these carbon nanomaterials in the aquatic environment. The purpose of this review is to compile up-to-date information on properties, applications and characterization methods of graphene family materials in aquatic environments and identified biological toxic impacts of these NMs, with special focus on graphene oxide based on the most recent literature.

AB  - Carnosic acid (CA; C20H28O4), a phenolic diterpene characterized as an ortho-dihydroquinone-type molecule, is a pro-electrophile agent that becomes an electrophile after reacting with free radicals. The electrophile generated from CA interacts with and activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, which is a major modulator of redox biology in mammalian cells. CA induces antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in several cell types, as observed in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. In this context, CA has been viewed as a neuroprotective agent by activating signaling pathways associated with cell survival during stressful conditions. Indeed, CA exhibits the ability to promote mitochondrial protection in neural cells. Mitochondria are the main source of both ATP and reactive species in animal cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the start and development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, among others. Therefore, the study of strategies aiming to reduce mitochondrial impairment in the case of neurodegeneration is of pharmacological interest. In the present review, it is described and discussed the effects of CA on brain mitochondria in experimental models of neural lesion. Based on the data discussed here, CA is a potential candidate to be listed as a neuroprotective agent by acting on the mitochondria of neural cells.

AB  - It has been hypothesised that environmental air pollution, especially airborne particles, is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and neurodegenerative conditions. However, epidemiological evidence is inconsistent and has not been previously evaluated as part of a systematic review. Our objectives were to carry out a systematic review of the epidemiological evidence on the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and T2DM and neurodegenerative diseases in adults and to identify if workplace exposures to particles are associated with an increased risk of T2DM and neurodegenerative diseases. Assessment of the quality of the evidence was carried out using the GRADE system, which considers the quality of the studies, consistency, directness, effect size, and publication bias. Available evidence indicates a consistent positive association between ambient air pollution and both T2DM and neurodegeneration risk, such as dementia and a general decline in cognition. However, corresponding evidence for workplace exposures are lacking. Further research is required to identify the link and mechanisms associated with particulate exposure and disease pathogenesis and to investigate the risks in occupational populations. Additional steps are needed to reduce air pollution levels and possibly also in the workplace environment to decrease the incidence of T2DM and cognitive decline.

AB  - Introduction: Individuals with major psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are at increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome due to lifestyle-and treatment-related factors. Numerous interventions have been tested in inpatient and outpatient mental health settings to decrease risk factors. Diet and exercise represent the mainstay of weight loss treatment. With this background the review aimed to evaluate the effects of psychoeducation, diet and physical activity interventions on reduction of metabolic syndrome risk factors such as BMI, Body weight, biochemical profiles in schizophrenia.
   Methods: The authors conducted database searches of PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Pubmed, Proquest, EBSCO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual searches from 1968 to 2017. Search indentified 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was critically appraised by 2 reviewers using established criteria. The outcome measures were body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, lipid profile, fasting glucose.
   Results: Interventions led to significant weight reduction (8 studies), reduced body mass index (5 studies), decreased waist circumference (4 studies) and lower blood glucose levels (5 studies). Dietician and nurse led interventions (6 studies). The studies showed non pharmacological interventions were effective in reducing risk factors.
   Conclusion: This review was able to demonstrate effectiveness of peychoeducation, diet and physical activity interventions were helpful to decrease and manage antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Results showed lifestyle interventions are safer and effective for promoting decrease or maintenance of weight and it can be delivered at low cost, safe and improves quality of life.

AB  - A systematic review of the literature was conducted to investigate suicidal self-directed violence and homelessness among US military veterans, and identify existing suicide prevention strategies. In November 2015, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google, and Google Scholar were searched. Articles published since 1990 investigating self-directed violence among homeless veterans were identified. Data were extracted and synthesized qualitatively. Nineteen observational studies were included. Suicide ideation rates were 1.3% (current), 7.0% (past week), 12.1%-18% (past 30days), and 74% (lifetime). Suicide attempt rates were 0%-6% (past 30days), 30.7%-31.5% (past 5 years), and 15%-46.6% (lifetime). Death by suicide rate was 81.0 per 100,000. No interventional studies to prevent self-directed violence among homeless veterans were identified. Homeless veterans are at risk for self-directed violence, suggesting the need for research to examine preventive strategies. A comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention needs to focus on vulnerable populations, including homeless veterans.

AB  - The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically examine the short- and long-term effects of group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for adolescent depression and to examine the role of various moderators of the reported effect sizes. A comprehensive literature search of relevant randomized-controlled trials identified 23 studies containing 49 post-intervention and 56 follow-up comparisons. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated both for post-intervention and follow-up. A three-level random effects approach was used to model the dependent effect sizes. Group CBT was more efficacious than control conditions both at post-intervention (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.19]) and at follow-up (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.30, -0.11]). Having an inactive control group was associated with a larger post-intervention effect size, while having a longer follow-up duration was associated with a smaller follow-up effect size. Even though the effect sizes are low, research suggests that group CBT is a significant treatment for adolescent depression.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges to understanding, predicting, and preventing suicide is that we have never had the ability to observe and intervene upon them as they unfold in real-time. Recently developed real-time monitoring methods are creating new opportunities for scientific and clinical advances. For instance, recent real-time monitoring studies of suicidal thoughts show that they typically are episodic, with quick onset and short duration. Many known risk factors that predict changes in suicidal thoughts over months/years (e.g. hopelessness) do not predict changes over hours/days - highlighting the gap in our abilities for short-term prediction. Current and future studies using newer streams of data from smartphone sensors (e.g. GPS) and wearables (e.g. heart rate) are further expanding knowledge and clinical possibilities.

AB  - This article investigates whether, and how, an artificial intelligence (AI) system can be said to use visual, imagery-based representations in a way that is analogous to the use of visual mental imagery by people. In particular, this article aims to answer two fundamental questions about imagery-based Al systems. First, what might visual imagery look like in an AI system, in terms of the internal representations used by the system to store and reason about knowledge? Second, what kinds of intelligent tasks would an imagery-based AI system be able to accomplish? The first question is answered by providing a working definition of what constitutes an imagery-based knowledge representation, and the second question is answered through a literature survey of imagery-based AI systems that have been developed over the past several decades of AI research, spanning task domains of: 1) template-based visual search; 2) spatial and diagrammatic reasoning; 3) geometric analogies and matrix reasoning; 4) naive physics; and 5) commonsense reasoning for question answering. This article concludes by discussing three important open research questions in the study of visual-imagery-based AI systems on evaluating system performance, learning imagery operators, and representing abstract concepts and their implications for understanding human visual mental imagery.

AB  - Objectives: This meta-analysis aims to study the effects of atomoxetine and methylphenidate on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and a number of adverse cardiac events on patients receiving treatment for attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) in comparison to placebo and between atomoxetine and methylphenidate. Methods: We searched the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect. Meta-analysis was performed on studies that examined the relationships between methylphenidate or atomoxetine and HR, SBP, as well as a number of adverse cardiac events. These studies were either placebo-controlled or comparison studies between methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Meta-regression identified patient- and treatment-related factors that may contribute to heterogeneity. Results: Twenty-two studies were included and the total number of participants was 46,107. Children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate had more significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR (p < 0.001) and SBP (p < 0.001) than those treated by placebo. Children and adolescents treated with atomoxetine had more significant increases post- vs. pre-treatment HR (p = 0.025) and SBP (p < 0.001) than those treated with methylphenidate. Meta-regression revealed mean age of participants, mean dose, and duration of atomoxetine and methylphenidate as significant moderators that explained heterogeneity. There were no differences in the number of adverse cardiac events between participants with methylphenidate treatment and placebo or atomoxetine. Conclusions: Children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate resulted in significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP as compared to placebo. Similarly, children and adolescents treated with atomoxetine had significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP than those treated with methylphenidate. These findings have potential implications for continuous monitoring of HR and SBP throughout the course of treatment although the risk for adverse cardiac events were insignificant.

AB  - AimNegative symptoms are a cause of enduring disability in serious mental illness. In spite of this, the development of effective treatments for negative symptoms has remained slow. The challenge of improving negative symptom outcomes is compounded by our limited understanding of their aetiology and longitudinal development.
   MethodsA literature search was conducted for life course approach of negative symptoms using PubMed. Further articles were included following manual checking of reference lists and other search strategies. The paper contains a theoretical synthesis of the literature, summarized using conceptual models.
   ResultsNegative symptom definitions are compared and considered within a context of the life course. Previous studies suggest that several illness phases may contribute to negative symptoms, highlighting our uncertainty in relation to the origin of negative symptoms.
   ConclusionsSimilar to other aspects of schizophrenia, negative symptoms likely involve a complex interplay of several risk and protective factors at different life phases. Concepts suggested in this article, such as negative symptom reserve theory, require further research, which may inform future prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - The article is basically an attempt to provide a consolidated report on impact assessment and trends in research pertaining to accumulation and curbing the menace of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) accumulation in leaves. Emphasis is given to understand the consequences of the fact that edible/medicinal plants cultivated in PAH contaminated soil or close to such places which are potential liberators of PAHs can virtually act as transporters for direct PAH entry into biological systems. An attempt has been made to predict the future by digging out golden facts from history. Extensive Scopus-based data mining has been done to dig out research data since last 10 years (2006-2016) pertaining to the said area. Critical analysis of statistical data on research trends highlighting the different aspects of evaluation of PAH accumulation in leaves has been described. The concentrate of all researches for the said period have been presented as few golden principles which shall serve as important facts for researchers and policy makers for curbing the menace of PAH-induced oxidative stress in plants and shall also provide start-up ideas for researchers new to the area. Critical analysis of trends in phytoremediation aspect has also been duly highlighted to measure the intensity of restoration steps taken by researchers and government to safeguard the future generations.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic metal released into the environment through anthropogenic activities. Phytoremediation is a green technology used for the stabilization or remediation of Cd-contaminated soils. Brassica crop species can produce high biomass under a range of climatic and growing conditions, allowing for considerable uptake and accumulation of Cd, depending on species. These crop species can tolerate Cd stress via different mechanisms, including the stimulation of the antioxidant defense system, chelation, compartmentation of Cd into meta-bolically inactive parts, and accumulation of total amino-acids and osmoprotectants. A higher Cd-stress level, however, overcomes the defense system and may cause oxidative stress in Brassica species due to overproduction of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, numerous approaches have been followed to decrease Cd toxicity in Brassica species, including selection of Cd-tolerant cultivars, the use of inorganic and organic amendments, exogenous application of soil organisms, and employment of plant-growth regulators. Furthermore, the coupling of genetic engineering with cropping may also help to alleviate Cd toxicity in Brassica species. However, several field studies demonstrated contrasting results. This review suggests that the combination of Cd-tolerant Brassica cultivars and the application of soil amendments, along with proper agricultural practices, may be the most efficient means of the soil Cd phytoattenuation. Breeding and selection of Cd-tolerant species, as well as species with higher biomass production, might be needed in the future when aiming to use Brassica species for phytoremediation.

AB  - Background Acutely occurring, life-threatening side-effects of antipsychotic drugs might contribute to the reduced life expectancy observed in patients with severe mental disorders. We aimed to assess this hypothesis by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of deaths occurring in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotic drugs.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised controlled trials comparing second-generation antipsychotics with placebo across several diagnostic categories. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from inception (the last search was done on Jan 21, 2017), and contacted pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities for further eligible trials. We examined mortality from any cause (the primary outcome) and mortality from natural causes, suicide, and other non-natural causes. We synthesised the results with odds ratios (ORs) in a common-effects meta-analysis. We investigated the effects of age, diagnostic category, sex, study duration, antipsychotic drug used, drug dose, and polypharmacy in subgroup and meta-regression analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016033930.
   Findings We identified 596 randomised controlled trials published between 1978 and 2017, comprising 108 747 participants. 352 studies (comprising 84 988 participants) with mortality data available constituted the main dataset for our meta-analysis. 207 (0.4%) deaths were reported in 53 804 patients on an antipsychotic drug and 99 (0.3%) deaths in 31 184 patients on placebo. 300 (85%) of 352 trials were 13 weeks (3 months) or shorter in duration (median 6 weeks; IQR 4-10). We found no evidence of a difference between antipsychotic drugs and placebo in mortality by any cause (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.93-1.53), from natural causes (1.29; 0.85-1.94), from suicide (1.15; 0.47-2.81), and from other non-natural causes (1.55; 0.66-3.63). Most subgroup and meta-regression analyses did not indicate any important effect moderators. The exceptions were increased mortality in patients with dementia (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10-2.21), in elderly patients (1.38; 1.01-1.89), in aripiprazole-treated patients (2.20; 1.00-4.86), and in studies with a higher proportion of women (regression coefficient 0.025; 95% credible interval 0.010-0.040). However, the effects in elderly patients, aripiprazole-treated patients, and women were mainly based on the included dementia trials. For patients with schizophrenia there was no evidence of an increased mortality risk (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.35-1.35).
   Interpretation Overall, and for the main indication of schizophrenia, there is no evidence from randomised trials that antipsychotic drugs increase mortality. However, vulnerable populations (particularly patients with dementia) might be at increased risk. This meta-analysis could only address acute treatment effects leading to death in the short-term, and not long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs on mortality. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Integrated or collaborative care is a well-evidenced and widely practiced approach to improve access to high-quality mental health care in primary care and other settings. Psychiatrists require preparation for this emerging type of practice, and such training is now mandatory for Canadian psychiatry residents. However, it is not known how best to mount such training, and in the absence of such knowledge, the quality of training across Canada has suffered. To guide integrated care education nationally, we conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished training programs.
   Method: We searched journal databases and web-based grey' literature and contacted all North American psychiatry residency programs known to provide integrated care training. We included educational interventions targeting practicing psychiatrists or psychiatry residents as learners. We critically appraised literature using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). We described the goals, content, and format of training, as well as outcomes categorized according to Kirkpatrick level of impact.
   Results: We included 9 published and 5 unpublished educational interventions. Studies were of low to moderate quality and reflected possible publication bias toward favourable outcomes. Programs commonly involved longitudinal clinical experiences for residents, mentoring networks for practicing physicians, or brief didactic experiences and were rarely oriented toward the most empirically supported models of integrated care. Implementation challenges were widespread.
   Conclusions: Similar to integrated care clinical interventions, integrated care training is important yet difficult to achieve. Educational initiatives could benefit from faculty development, quality improvement to synergistically improve care and training, and stronger evaluation.

AB  - Objectives: To review empirical evaluations of individual-level interventions intended to improve mental health or well-being for vulnerable adolescents.
   Study design: This is a systematic mapping review.
   Methods: Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005-2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10-24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, 'looked after', carers).
   Results: Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups.
   Conclusions: Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.

AB  - Parkin for more than a decade has been portrayed as a neuroprotector gene is now increasingly emerging as a multifaceted gene that can exert entirely opposite effects i.e., both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Parkinson's disease, a neurological disease, progresses due to excess in cell death, while, in case of cancer, cell death normally fails to occur. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism, but several evidences indicate that Parkin is a tumor suppressor gene, involved in a variety of cancers. It is hard to imagine that two entirely different classes of disease, like cancer and Parkinson's disease, can converge at a critical point attributable to a single gene, Parkin. This mysterious and hidden connection may prove a boon in disguise and has raised hopes that studying the biology of one disease may help to identify novel targets of therapy for the other. In this Parkinson's disease-cancer story, if the detail of Parkin pathway is unraveled and gaps in the storyline are properly filled up, we may end getting an entirely new therapeutic option. This review mainly highlights the recent literature which suggests how Parkin gene regulates the various hallmarks of both the Parkinson's disease and cancer.

AB  - Background: Stigma across HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability can be co-occurring and may interact with other forms of stigma related to social identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Stigma is especially problematic for people living with these conditions because it can create barriers to accessing necessary social and structural supports, which can intensify their experiences with stigma. This review aims to contribute to the knowledge on stigma by advancing a cross-analysis of HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability stigma, and exploring whether and how intersectionality frameworks have been used in the systematic reviews of stigma.
   Methods: A search of the literature was conducted to identify systematic reviews which investigated stigma for HIV/AIDS, mental illness and/or physical disability. The electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and PsycINFO were searched for reviews published between 2005 and 2017. Data were extracted from eligible reviews on: type of systematic review and number of primary studies included in the review, study design study population(s), type(s) of stigma addressed, and destigmatizing interventions used. A keyword search was also done using the terms "intersectionality", "intersectional", and "intersection"; related definitions and descriptions were extracted. Matrices were used to compare the characteristics of reviews and their application of intersectional approaches across the three health conditions.
   Results: Ninety-eight reviews met the inclusion criteria. The majority (99%) of reviews examined only one of the health conditions. Just three reviews focused on physical disability. Most reviews (94%) reported a predominance of behavioural rather than structural interventions targeting stigma in the primary studies. Only 17% of reviews used the concept and/or approach of intersectionality; all but one of these reviews examined HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusions: The lack of systematic reviews comparing stigma across mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and physical disability indicates the need for more cross-comparative analyses among these conditions. The integration of intersectional approaches would deepen interrogations of co-occurring social identities and stigma.

AB  - Background: There is international recognition of the need for service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening. However, little is known about how best to integrate this approach into the mental healthcare system; what works to advance involvement, under what conditions, how and when does involvement bring added value, and how can it work in resource-poor settings in low and middle-income countries.
   Objective: To describe the methodology for a realist systematic review protocol to synthesise the evidence to explain the contexts, outcomes, and underlying mechanisms for involvement of service users with severe mental health problems and their caregivers in mental healthcare policy-making and planning, advocacy, service development, monitoring and improvement.
   Methods/designs: The proposed realist systematic review will involve five steps: (i) clarifying the review scope, (ii) a systematic search for evidence, (iii) evidence appraisal and data extraction, (iv) data analysis, (v) synthesis of evidence and formation of revised programme theory. Inputs from a formative qualitative study, consultative Theory of Change meetings with key stakeholder groups, and scoping reviews will be used to identify candidate theory/theories that will guide the selection, appraisal and analysis of studies, and refine the Theory of Change model that will be piloted and evaluated. Synthesis of data will be undertaken using realist logic, constant comparison and thematic analysis. In a consultative meeting with stakeholders the Theory of Change model will then be situated with respect to relevant programme theories and adapted to incorporate the synthesized evidence of relevance to the local context. The finalized Theory of Change model will be piloted and evaluated in a primary health care setting in rural Ethiopia.
   Discussion: Realist review methodology has not been applied to the area of mental health service user involvement in low-and middle-income country settings. In this protocol, we describe how this contextualized approach will be applied to identify and refine a theory-driven and transferable model of involvement of service users, embedded in ongoing work in Ethiopia.

AB  - Background: There is continued debate about the role of women and communities in influencing rising rates of caesarean section (CS). In settings where CS rates exceed recommended levels, mothers and babies are exposed to potential harms that may outweigh the potential benefits. There is therefore a need to understand how educational interventions targeted at women and communities to reduce unnecessary CS are perceived and used. This qualitative evidence synthesis aimed to explore what women and communities say about the barriers and facilitators to intervention effectiveness for these important groups.
   Method: Seven electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms. Studies reporting qualitative data pertaining to interventions, published between 1985 and March 2017, with no language restriction were sought. Study quality was independently assessed by two authors before qualitative evidence synthesis was undertaken using an interpretive, meta-ethnography approach. Resulting Statements of Findings were assessed using GRADE-CER Qual, and summarised thematically.
   Results: Twelve studies were included. They were published between 2001 and 2016. Eleven were from high-income countries. Twelve Summaries of Findings encompassed the data, and were graded (moderate or high) on CerQual. The Statements of Findings are reported under three final themes: 1) Mutability of women's and communities' beliefs about birth; 2) Multiplicity of individual information needs about birth; 3) Interactions with health professionals and influence of healthcare system on actual birth method. Women and communities value educational interventions that include opportunities for dialogue, are individualised (including acknowledgement of previous birth experiences), and are consistent with available clinical care and the advice of the health professional they come into contact with.
   Conclusion: Women's values and preferences for birth, and for information format and content, vary across populations, and evolves in individual women over time. Interactions with health professionals and health system factors can partly be responsible for changes in views. Educational interventions should take into account these dynamic interactions, as well as the women's need for emotional support and dialogue with professionals alongside information about birth. Further research is required to test these findings and the utility of their practical application, particularly in medium and low income settings.

AB  - Background: Exercise training is a beneficial treatment strategy for depression. Previous meta-analytical reviews mainly examined the effect of aerobic exercise on depressive symptoms neglecting comparisons with neuromuscular training and meta-regression considering relevant exercise training prescriptors such as exercise duration, intensity, number of exercise sessions (volume) and frequency.
   Methods: A structured literature search was conducted in biomedical and psychological databases and study selection was conducted following the PICOS approach. (Randomized) controlled trials that compared supervised neuromuscular or endurance exercise interventions with an inactive control group (CON) in clinically depressed in-or out-patients over 18 years were included. Eligibility and study quality were evaluated by two independent researchers. Standardized mean differences (SMD) for the reduction of depressive symptoms, measured with different evaluation scales (e.g., BDI, HAM-D, PHQ-9, HRSD, MADRS, GDS) were calculated with the adjusted Hedges'g equation as main outcome for the comparison of endurance and neuromuscular exercise interventions vs. CON. Statistical analyses were conducted using a random effects inverse-variance model. Multivariate meta-regression analysis was performed in order to examine the modulating effects of exercise training prescriptors.
   Results: Twenty seven trials with 1,452 clinically depressed adults were included. 20 out of 27 included trials reached a PEDro score of at least 6, representing high-quality. Irrespective of the exercise mode and study quality, large effects in favor of exercise compared to the control condition were found. Compared to CON, sensitivity analyses revealed a moderate to large effect in favor of endurance exercise [SMD: -0.79 (90% CI: -1.10, -0.48); p < 0.00001, I-2 = 84%] and a large effect size in favor of neuromuscular exercise [SMD: -1.14 (90 CI: -1.50, -0.78); p < 0.00001, I-2 = 80%]. These effects decreased to moderate for endurance and remained large for neuromuscular trials when considering studies of high quality, indicating a significant difference (p = 0.04). Multivariate meta-regression revealed that exercise duration in endurance trials and exercise intensity in neuromuscular trials had a significantly moderating effect.
   Conclusions: Strong neuromuscular exercise interventions can be slightly more effective than endurance exercise interventions. Interestingly, exercise duration and exercise intensity moderated the effect size meaningfully. This result might be used on exercise in depression to increase efficacy.

AB  - Background: Socio-economic inequalities are associated with unequal exposure to social, economic and environmental risk factors, which in turn contribute to health inequalities. Understanding the impact of specific public health policy interventions will help to establish causality in terms of the effects on health inequalities.
   Methods: Systematic review methodology was used to identify systematic reviews from high-income countries that describe the health equity effects of upstream public health interventions. Twenty databases were searched from their start date until May 2017. The quality of the included articles was determined using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR).
   Results: Twenty-nine systematic reviews were identified reporting 150 unique relevant primary studies. The reviews summarised evidence of all types of primary and secondary prevention policies (fiscal, regulation, education, preventative treatment and screening) across seven public health domains (tobacco, alcohol, food and nutrition, reproductive health services, the control of infectious diseases, the environment and workplace regulations). There were no systematic reviews of interventions targeting mental health. Results were mixed across the public health domains; some policy interventions were shown to reduce health inequalities (e.g. food subsidy programmes, immunisations), others have no effect and some interventions appear to increase inequalities (e.g. 20 mph and low emission zones). The quality of the included reviews (and their primary studies) were generally poor and clear gaps in the evidence base have been highlighted.
   Conclusions: The review does tentatively suggest interventions that policy makers might use to reduce health inequalities, although whether the programmes are transferable between high-income countries remains unclear.

AB  - Given the many instances of violence and crime that occur as a consequence of psychopathy, it is vital to find those variables that can reduce the expression of such behaviors. In this regard, one potentially useful variable is that known as Emotional Intelligence (EI) or the ability to perceive, use, understand, and regulate emotions. EI has been categorized according to three main approaches: performance-based ability, self-report ability, and self-report mixed models. Given the emotional deficits of the psychopathic population, EI could be a protective factor. Several studies have analyzed the relationship between EI and psychopathy, but the results are unclear. This disparity may be due to the EI model employed to measure EI. The aim of our research is to systematically review the relationship between the different models of EI and psychopathy, both in the total and clinical/inmate sample. We searched Scopus, Pubmed, and PsicINFO to find relevant articles. Twenty-nine eligible studies were found. They were divided according to the model of EI and the sample used. The results for the total sample differ according to the measure of EI: when the performance-based ability model is used, the majority of studies find a negative relationship between EI and psychopathy. When using self-reports, the results are inconsistent. The findings with the clinical/inmate sample are in the same direction as the total sample. In conclusion, the results suggest that higher EI abilities measured through performance-based ability models-but not through self-reports-are related to lower psychopathy deficits. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: Partnership, engagement, and collaboration (PEC) are critical factors in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research. Despite a growing recognition that incorporating PEC strategies in D&I research is likely to increase the relevance, feasibility, impacts, and of evidence-based interventions or practices (EBIs, EBPs), conceptual frameworks and methodologies to guide the development and testing of PEC strategies in D&I research are lacking. To address this methodological gap, a review was conducted to summarize what we know, what we think we know, and what we need to know about PEC to inform D&I research.
   Methods: A cross-field scoping review, drawing upon a broad range of PEC related literature in health, was conducted. Publications reviewed focused on factors influencing PEC, and processes, mechanisms and strategies for promoting effective PEC. The review was conducted separately for three forms of partnerships that are commonly used in D&I research: (1) consumer-provider or patient-implementer partnership; (2) delivery system or implementation team partnership; and (3) sustainment/support or interagency/community partnership. A total of 39 studies, of which 21 were review articles, were selected for an in-depth review.
   Results: Across three forms of partnerships, four domains (cognitive, interpersonal/affective, behavioral, and contextual domains) were consistently identified as factors and strategies for promoting PEC. Depending on the stage (preparation or execution) and purpose of the partnership (regulating performance or managing maintenance), certain PEC strategies are more or less relevant. Recent developments of PEC frameworks, such as Partnership Stage of Change and multiple dynamic processes, provide more comprehensive conceptual explanations for PEC mechanisms, which can better guide PEC strategies selection and integration in D&I research.
   Conclusions: This review contributes to D&I knowledge by identifying critical domain factors, processes, or mechanisms, and key strategies for PEC, and offers a multi-level PEC framework for future research to build the evidence base. However, more research is needed to test PEC mechanisms.

AB  - Background: The electrical parameters used for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders have been relatively well studied, however for the newer indications of DBS for psychiatric indications these are less clear. Based on the movement disorder literature, use of the correct stimulation parameters should be crucial for clinical outcomes. This review examines the stimulation parameters used in DBS studies for treatment resistant depression (TRD) and their relevance to clinical outcome and brain targets.
   Methods: We examined the published studies on DBS for TRD archived in major databases. Data on stimulus parameters (frequency, pulse width, amplitude), stimulation mode, brain target, efficacy, safety, and duration of follow up were extracted from 29 observational studies including case reports of patients with treatment resistant unipolar, bipolar, and co-morbid depression.
   Results: The algorithms commonly used to optimize efficacy were increasing amplitude followed by changing the electric contacts or increasing pulse width. High frequency stimulation (> 100Hz) was applied in most cases across brain targets. Keeping the high frequency stimulation constant, three different combinations of parameters were mainly used: (i) short pulse width (60-90 us) and low amplitude (0-4 V), (ii) short pulse width and high amplitude (5-10 V), (iii) long pulse width (120-450 us) and low amplitude. There were individual variations in clinical response to electrical dosing and also in the time of clinical recovery. There was no significant difference in mean stimulation parameters between responders and non-responders suggesting a role for stimulation unrelated factors in response.
   Conclusions: Although limited by open trials and small sample size, three optimal stimulation parameter combinations emerged from this review. Studies are needed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of these combinations, such as a registry of data from patients undergoing DBS for TRD with individual data on stimulation parameters.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated cell death, distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis and other forms of cell death. Ferroptosis is induced by disruption of glutathione synthesis or inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4, exacerbated by iron, and prevented by radical scavengers such as ferrostatin-1, liproxstatin-1, and endogenous vitamin E. Ferroptosis terminates with mitochondrial dysfunction and toxic lipid peroxidation. Although conclusive identification of ferroptosis in vivo is challenging, several salient and very well established features of neurodegenerative diseases are consistent with ferroptosis, including lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial disruption and iron dysregulation. Accordingly, interest in the role of ferroptosis in neurodegeneration is escalating and specific evidence is rapidly emerging. One aspect that has thus far received little attention is the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This transcription factor regulates hundreds of genes, of which many are either directly or indirectly involved in modulating ferroptosis, including metabolism of glutathione, iron and lipids, and mitochondrial function. This potentially positions Nrf2 as a key deterministic component modulating the onset and outcomes of ferroptotic stress. The minimal direct evidence currently available is consistent with this and indicates that Nrf2 may be critical for protection against ferroptosis. In contrast, abundant evidence demonstrates that enhancing Nrf2 signaling is potently neuroprotective in models of neurodegeneration, although the exact mechanism by which this is achieved is unclear. Further studies are required to determine to extent to which the neuroprotective effects of Nrf2 activation involve the prevention of ferroptosis.

AB  - Over the last few years, automatic facial micro-expression analysis has garnered increasing attention from experts across different disciplines because of its potential applications in various fields such as clinical diagnosis, forensic investigation and security systems. Advances in computer algorithms and video acquisition technology have rendered machine analysis of facial micro-expressions possible today, in contrast to decades ago when it was primarily the domain of psychiatrists where analysis was largely manual. Indeed, although the study of facial micro-expressions is a well-established field in psychology, it is still relatively new from the computational perspective with many interesting problems. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art databases and methods for micro-expressions spotting and recognition. Individual stages involved in the automation of these tasks are also described and reviewed at length. In addition, we also deliberate on the challenges and future directions in this growing field of automatic facial micro-expression analysis.

AB  - Background: DSM-5 introduced the diagnostic category of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. This systematic review examines published reports linking mania with the consumption of herbal medicines (HM), excluding cannabis. Putative pathophysiological mechanisms that may account for the reported HM being associated with mania are discussed.
   Methods: A systematic search of EMBASE, CINAHL, Health Source, PsychINFO, and PubMed. The quality of case reports meeting inclusion criteria was assessed using the modified Quality Assessment Scale by Agbabiaka.
   Results: Nineteen single and seven multiple-case reports met inclusion criteria. These yielded a study sample of 35 case reports, 28 of herbal medicine associated mania, 5 of hypomania, and twomixed states, in 17 females [age in yearsM(SD) = 43.1(13.2)] and 18 males [40.7(18.1)]. A total of 11 herbalmedicines were implicated. Case reports by herbal medicine (number of reports) comprised: St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (14); Ginseng (Panax ginseng) (5); brindleberry (Garcinia cambogia) (4); ma-huang (Ephedra sinica) (3); "herbal slimming pills" (2); Herbalife products (2); Hydroxycut (1); horny goat weed (Epimedium grandiflorum) (1); " herbal body tonic" (1); celery root (Apium graveolans) (1), and a "herbal mixture" (1). All case reports were associated with use rather than withdrawal of herbalmedicines. Only one case report was rated for probability of association using a standardized algorithm. Laboratory assays to confirm composition of the herbal preparation were reported in only one article describing two cases and indicating admixture of a likely causal pharmaceutical in the herbal preparation.
   Conclusions: Causal attributions are problematic given the limited number of reports, antidepressant co-prescribing in 7 cases, insufficient data regarding pattern and type of herbal medicine use, and lack of a reference frequency for spontaneous mania. The quality assessment scores across the 26 papers (35 case reports) were as follows: low quality (0), lower-medium quality (9), upper-medium quality (10) and high quality (7). Putative pathophysiological mechanisms were postulated for nine of the 11 herbal medicines and centered on HPA-axis activation and increased monoamine activity. Systematic study of the association between herbal medicines and the course of bipolar disorder may contribute to defining targets for pathophysiological research.

AB  - The brain's reliance on glucose as a primary fuel source is well established, but psychological models of cognitive processing that take energy supply into account remain uncommon. One exception is research on self-control depletion, where debate continues over a limited-resource model. This model argues that a transient reduction in self-control after the exertion of prior self-control is caused by the depletion of brain glucose, and that self-control processes are special, perhaps unique, in this regard. This model has been argued to be physiologically implausible in several recent reviews. This paper attempts to correct some inaccuracies that have occurred during debate over the physiological plausibility of this model. We contend that not only is such limitation of cognition by constraints on glucose supply plausible, it is well established in the neuroscience literature across several cognitive domains. Conversely, we argue that there is no evidence that self-control is special in regard to its metabolic cost. Mental processes require physical energy, and the body is limited in its ability to supply the brain with sufficient energy to fuel mental processes. This article reviews current findings in brain metabolism and seeks to resolve the current conflict in the field regarding the physiological plausibility of the self-control glucose-depletion hypothesis.

AB  - Despite aging being by far the greatest risk factor for highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, the molecular underpinnings of age-related brain changes are still not well understood, particularly the transition from normal healthy brain aging to neuropathological aging. Aging is an extremely complex, multifactorial process involving the simultaneous interplay of several processes operating at many levels of the functional organization. The buildup of potentially toxic protein aggregates and their spreading through various brain regions has been identified as a major contributor to these pathologies. One of the most striking morphologic changes in neurons during normal aging is the accumulation of lipofuscin (LF) aggregates, as well as, neuromelanin pigments. LF is an autofluorescent lipopigment formed by lipids, metals and misfolded proteins, which is especially abundant in nerve cells, cardiac muscle cells and skin. Within the Central Nervous System (CNS), LF accumulates as aggregates, delineating a specific senescence pattern in both physiological and pathological states, altering neuronal cytoskeleton and cellular trafficking and metabolism, and being associated with neuronal loss, and glial proliferation and activation. Traditionally, the accumulation of LF in the CNS has been considered a secondary consequence of the aging process, being a mere bystander of the pathological buildup associated with different neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we discuss recent evidence suggesting the possibility that LF aggregates may have an active role in neurodegeneration. We argue that LF is a relevant effector of aging that represents a risk factor or driver for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Objectives: Although the benefits of regular physical activity (PA) are widely accepted, most of the population fails to meet the recommended levels of activity. Public health bodies such as the World Health Organisation emphasise promoting PA within workplaces as a key intervention setting to reach the health and well-being of the working population. Given the importance of well-being in workplace settings, it seems worthwhile to explore the evidence of effectiveness in the literature. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of PA interventions for improving psychological well-being in working adults. It provides a review of current evidence, assesses the quality of the research into this topic area and identifies issues and recommendations for future research.
   Study design: A systematic review guided by the Cochrane Handbook was conducted.
   Methods: PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library literature searches were conducted from 2007 to April 2017. Using the keywords 'Physical Activity'; 'Exercise'; 'Wellbeing'; 'Employee' and 'Workplace', five articles were obtained that fit the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were a workplace setting, an intervention including a PA intervention and an outcome measure including well-being. Extraction of articles and quality assessment of the articles were performed independently by two authors using the Cochrane's data extraction form and the Cochrane's risk of bias. Owing to heterogeneity in population characteristics, intervention components, outcome measures and the durations of interventions, a narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: The review identified five office-based workplace PA interventions in promoting psychological well-being in 1326 participants. The included studies varied substantially in sample size characteristics, methodological quality, duration of follow-up, types of interventions and assessed outcomes. Three of the five included studies were of high quality. The types of PA intervention included yoga, exercise and three studies focussing on walking interventions. The findings evidenced that exercise, yoga and walking interventions improve well-being as measured across workplace settings compared with no intervention. Some studies did not include a placebo control group and therefore, a form of PA intervention regardless of the type may be better than no intervention at all.
   Conclusion: This review found mixed evidence that PA interventions can be effective in improving well-being across office settings. Although, the findings are promising, because of methodological failings, there is no conclusive evidence. Current evidence indicates that employees can improve their psychological well-being by participating in any form of PA interventions in an office setting.

It has been reported that melatonin level is disturbed in some neurological conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, which indicates its involvement in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Its properties qualify it to be a promising potential therapeutic neuroprotective agent, with no side effects, for some neurological disorders. This review discusses and localizes the effect of melatonin in the pathophysiology of some diseases.

AB  - Problematic Internet use (PIU) among students has become a significant mental health concern. Our goals were to review the existing studies on problematic Internet from Southeast Asian Region and examine: the prevalence for PIU among students; explore for sociodemographic and clinical correlates; and assess the physical, mental, and psychosocial impact of PIU in this population. All studies conducted among population of the Southeast Asia, involving students (school students to postgraduate students) of any age which explored etiological factors and/or the prevalence or any other factor associated with PIU/Internet addiction were considered eligible for the present review. The electronic databases of PubMed and Google Scholar were systematically searched for the relevant published studies up to and including October 2016. Our search strategy yielded 549 articles, 295 of which were eligible for screening based on their publication in English language in a peer-reviewed journal. Of these, a total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The prevalence of severe PIU/Internet addiction ranged from 0 to 47.4%, whereas the prevalence of Internet overuse/possible Internet addiction ranged from 7.4% to 46.4% among students from Southeast Asia. Physical impairments in the form of insomnia (26.8%), daytime sleepiness (20%), and eye strain (19%) were also reported among problem users. There is a need to conduct further research in this area to explore the protective and risk factors associated with it and also longitudinally assess the trajectories of the outcome.

Methodology: A thorough Pubmed search was conducted looking for the results of articles that treated cardiovascular disease patients of both sexes and all ages with lifestyle modification in which the effectiveness of lifestyle modification was measured by various biomarkers. Results: The final review was conducted on 11 journal articles that were found examining exercise, diet, psychosocial support and stress management in cardiovascular disease patients and showing a positive benefit of such an intervention and the effects on biomarkers as an alternative to traditional pharmacological treatment. The affected biomarkers found were percent diameter coronary artery stenosis, blood pressure, cholesterol, body weight and fat, heart rate, HbA1c, exercise capacity, C reactive protein, triglycerides and BMI. Conclusion: Lifestyle modification consisting of exercise, low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet, psychosocial support and stress management is clinically efficacious in the treatment of cardiovascular disease as seen by the various changes in biological measures.

AB  - Impulsive-compulsive behavior (ICB) in Parkinson's disease (PD) suggests a combination of impulse control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating, excessive buying, and compulsive behaviors, such as punding, dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), hoarding, and hobbyism. Hypersexuality and gambling are common in male patients while compulsive buying is common in women patients. Recent studies reveal the prevalence of ICB to be more than 25% among the PD patients. The nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ICDs in PD patients. The greater tonic release of dopamine creates a state of relative dopamine deficit and reduced reward sensation and impulsive behaviors. The major risk factors for ICB are the use of dopamine agonist (DA), male gender, young patient, depression, smoking, drug abuse, Parkin mutation, and family history of ICDs. Single nucleotide polymorphism in dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 also acts as a major risk factor. Questionnaire for impulsive-compulsive disorders in PD is the most widely adopted screening tool for the detection of ICB in PD. The major treatment for PD is to discontinue DAs and use prolonged release formulation of the DAs. The role of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and apomorphine in the treatment of ICB is still uncertain. Though DBS can reduce the risk of DDS, it can precipitate new ICBs such as hypersexuality.

AB  - The lifetime risk of suicide and suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia are 5% and 25%-50%, respectively. The current meta-analysis aims to determine risk factors associated with suicidality in subjects with schizophrenia. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the reference lists of included studies. Inclusion criteria were met if an article reported a dichotomous sample of patients with schizophrenia with suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, or suicide compared to patients without. We also performed a cohort study meta-analysis as a supplemental analysis. A total of 96 studies with 80 488 participants were included in our analysis. Depressive symptoms (P<.0001), Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) general score (P<.0001) and number of psychiatric hospitalizations (P<.0001) were higher in patients with suicide ideation. History of alcohol use (P=.0001), family history of psychiatric illness (P<.0001), physical comorbidity (P<.0001), history of depression (P<.0001), family history of suicide (P<.0001), history of drug use (P=.0024), history of tobacco use (P=.0034), being white (P=.0022), and depressive symptoms (P<.0001) were the most consistent variables associated with suicide attempts. The first two were also significant in the cohort meta-analysis. Being male (P=.0005), history of attempted suicide (P<.0001), younger age (P=.0266), higher intelligence quotient (P<.0001), poor adherence to treatment (P<.0001), and hopelessness (P<.0001) were the most consistently associated with suicide. The first three were also significant in the cohort meta-analysis. Our findings may help with future development of preventive strategies to combat suicide. Future studies may combine the above-mentioned variables by using multivariate predictive analysis techniques to objectively stratify suicidality in schizophrenia.

AB  - In the present review, we critically examine the state-of-the-art of the research on combined effects of trace metals and light on photosynthetic microorganisms in aquatic environment. Light of different intensity and spectral composition affects the interactions between trace metals and photosynthetic microorganisms directly, by affecting vital cellular functions and metal toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, and indirectly, by changing ambient medium characteristics. Light radiation and in particular, the ultraviolet radiation component (UVR) alters the structure and reactivity of dissolved organic matter in natural water, which in most of the cases decreases its metal binding capacity and enhances metal bioavailability. The increase of cellular metal concentrations is generally associated with increasing light intensity, however further studies are necessary to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Studies on the combined exposures of photosynthetic microorganisms to metals and UVR reveal antagonistic, additive or synergistic interactions depending on light intensity, spectral composition or light pre-exposure history. Among the light spectrum components, most of the research was performed with UVR, while the knowledge on the role of high-intensity visible light and environmentally relevant solar light radiation is still limited. The extent of combined effects also depends on the exposure sequence and duration, as well as the species-specific sensitivity of the tested microorganisms and the activation of stress defense responses.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, and occurring in both sporadic and familial form. The origin of the disease is unknown, though increasing evidence suggests that the interaction between genetic and environmental factors may increase susceptibility to ALS, including its sporadic form. Although genetic mutations have been correlated to the familial type of ALS, relatively little is known about the sporadic type (sALS). Genetic factors concerning pesticide metabolism and heavy metal detoxification are increasing the susceptibility to sALS. This review focuses on the genes implicated in metabolic detoxification pathways of environmental toxicants and their potential role in ALS susceptibility.

AB  - Objective: Youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis often demonstrate significant negative symptoms, which have been reported to be predictive of conversion to psychosis and a reduced quality of life but treatment options for negative symptoms remain inadequate. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of all intervention studies examining negative symptom outcomes in youth at CHR for psychosis. Method: The authors searched PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and EBM from inception to December 2016. Studies were selected if they included any intervention that reported follow-up negative symptoms in youth at CHR for psychosis. Treatment comparisons were evaluated using both pairwise and network meta-analyses. Due to the differences in negative symptom scales the effect sizes were reported as the standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Of 3027 citations, 32 studies met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 2463 CHR participants. The null hypothesis was not rejected for any of the 11 treatments. N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) modulators trended toward a significant reduction in negative symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI = -1.09 to 0.02; I-2 = 0%, P = .06). In respective order of descending effectiveness as per the treatment hierarchy, NMDAR modulators were more effective than family therapy, need-based interventions, risperidone, a misulpride, cognitive behavioral therapy, omega-3, olanzapine, supportive therapy, and integrated psychological interventions. Conclusions: Efficacy and effectiveness were not confirmed for any negative symptom treatment. Many studies had small samples and the majority were not designed to target negative symptoms.

AB  - Objectives The fit note, introduced in England, Wales and Scotland in 2010, was designed to change radically the sickness certification process from advising individuals on their inability to work to advising them on what they could do if work could be adapted. Our review aimed to evaluate the following: (1) Is the maybe fit' for work option being selected for patients? (2) Are work solutions being recommended? (3) Has the fit note increased return to work? (4) Has the fit note reduced the length of sickness absence? We considered the way in which outcomes vary according to patient demographics including type of health problem.
   Methods Studies were identified by a systematic search. We included all studies of any design conducted in the UK with working age adults, aged 16 or over, from 1 April 2010 to 1 Nov 2017. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
   Results Thirteen papers representing seven studies met inclusion criteria. In the largest study, maybe fit' for work was recommended in 6.5% of fit notes delivered by general practitioners (GP; n=361801) between April 2016 and March 2017. Maybe fit' recommendations were made in 8.5%-10% of fit notes received by primary care patients in employment, and in 10%-32% of patients seen by GPs trained in the Diploma in Occupational Medicine. Maybe fit' was recommended more for women, those with higher socioeconomic status, and for physical, as opposed to psychiatric disorders. The majority of fit notes with the maybe fit' option selected included work solutions. There was inconclusive evidence to suggest that the introduction of the fit note has reduced sickness absence among patients in employment.
   Conclusions Fit notes represent a major shift in public policy. Our review suggests that they have been incompletely researched and not implemented as intended.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disease, clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and gradual impairment of cognitive functions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been considered a possible therapeutic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no quantitative data synthesis of MSC therapy for AD exists. We conducted asystematic review and meta-analysis to study the effects of MSCs on cognitive deficits in animal models of AD.
   Methods: We identified eligible studies published from January 1980 to January 2017 by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI). The endpoint was the effects of MSCs on cognitive performance evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test including escape latency, and/or number of platform crossing, and/or time in the target quadrant.
   Results: Nine preclinical studies incorporating 225 animals with AD were included for the meta-analysis. The studies indicated that MSC-based treatment significantly improved the learning function through measurements of the escape latency (SMD = -0.99, 95% CI = -1.33 to -0.64, p < .00001). Additionally, we observed that transplantation of MSCs significantly increased the number of platform crossing in six experiments (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.43 to 1.13, p < .0001). What's more, the times in the target quadrant were increased in five studies indicated that transplantation of MSCs could ameliorate the cognitive impairments (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.67, p = .0005).
   Conclusions: This study showed that MSC transplantation could reduce cognitive deficits in AD models. These findings support the further studies to translate MSCs in the treatment of AD in humans

AB  - BackgroundReframing means changing the way that a person thinks or feels about a weight loss attempt or weight loss maintenance to enhance its experience or facilitate its success. Although participants have described this, it has not been explored in the academic literature. Here, we set out to systematically review qualitative studies to examine the ways in which people use and experience reframing in self-directed weight loss.
   MethodsSeven electronic databases were searched to January 2017 for qualitative studies of adults with overweight or obesity attempting to lose weight or maintain weight loss through self-directed behavior change. Studies must have contained some information pertinent to reframing. Thematic synthesis was used to identify descriptive and analytical themes from the available data.
   ResultsWe included 23 studies, representing 723 participants. No study focused specifically on reframing. Most studies involved people who had tried to lose weight previously. In the most common examples of reframing, participants spoke of construing previous weight management attempts as dieting, whereas in current attempts they used reframing to move away from this concept. Participants spoke of finding reframing helpful because it removed the sense of depriving themselves and instead allowed them to construe the food choices as healthful. Likewise, the language of dieting created a sense of temporary effort, while construing this as a way of life allowed continuation of conscious control over energy balance without the feeling of undue effort. In some cases, these changes were bolstered by change in self-identity.
   ConclusionsSome people construe deliberate weight loss as a form of deprivation and cognitively reframe to avoid the negative emotions this creates and to prevent relapse. Reframing the dietary regimen as about healthy eating and a new way of life made weight control seem less burdensome for these participants and they felt able to maintain their efforts.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide that mediates the stress response. Long known to contribute to regulation of the adrenal stress response initiated in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), a complex pattern of extrahypothalamic CRF expression is also described in rodents and primates. Cross-talk between the CRF and midbrain dopamine (DA) systems links the stress response to DA regulation. Classically CRF + cells in the extended amygdala and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are considered the main source of this input, principally targeting the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, the anatomic complexity of both the DA and CRF system has been increasingly elaborated in the last decade. The DA neurons are now recognized as having diverse molecular, connectional and physiologic properties, predicted by their anatomic location. At the same time, the broad distribution of CRF cells in the brain has been increasingly delineated using different species and techniques. Here, we review updated information on both CRF localization and newer conceptualizations of the DA system to reconsider the CRF-DA interface.

AB  - Phthalates are ubiquitous in environment. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Phthalate exposure is associated with hypertension in multiple studies. This review aims to summarize the scientific literature on associations between phthalate exposure and hypertension and discuss the mechanisms in the relationship. We identified and reviewed original articles published to March 2018, using PubMed and Web of Science to search the terms "phthalate(s)," "phthalic acid," "blood pressure," "high blood pressure," "hypertension," "prehypertension," and "cardiovascular disease." Findings were summarized based on the relevance to the themes, including presentation of main phthalates and their major metabolites as well as associations of phthalate exposure with blood pressure in epidemiological and experimental studies. We identified ten population-based investigations and five toxicological experiments. Epidemiological data underscored a possible correlation between phthalate exposure and hypertension in adults, whereas individual study in children stands on the opposite. Experimental studies mainly targeted the increasing effect of phthalates on blood pressure. This review suggested some underlying mechanisms of phthalate-associated hypertension. Considering the current evidence, phthalate might be risk factors of hypertension. However, the effect of phthalate exposure in early life on blood pressure in later life or adulthood is still unclear. Well-designed longitudinal and molecular mechanism studies are indispensable.

AB  - Studying the phenotypic manifestations of increased genetic liability for schizophrenia can increase our understanding of this disorder. Specifically, information from alleles identified in genome-wide association studies can be collapsed into a polygenic risk score (PRS) to explore howgenetic risk ismanifestwithin different samples. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of studies examining associations between schizophrenia PRS (SZ-PRS) and several phenotypic measures. We searched EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO (from August 2009-14th March 2016) plus references of included studies, following PRISMA guidelines. Study inclusion was based on predetermined criteria and data were extracted independently and in duplicate. Overall, SZ-PRS was associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, lower performance IQ and negative symptoms. SZ-PRS explained up to 6% of genetic variation in psychiatric phenotypes, compared to <0.7% in measures of cognition. Future gains fromusing the PRS approach may be greater if used for examining phenotypes that are more closely related to biological substrates, for scores based on genepathways, and where PRSs are used to stratify individuals for study of treatment response. As it was difficult to interpret findings across studies due to insufficient information provided by many studies, we propose a framework to guide robust reporting of PRS associations in the future.

AB  - Introduction: There is increasing evidence of excess mortality in schizophrenia but less information on other non affective psychoses. We therefore generated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses, relative to the general population, and examined changes to the SMR over time.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review in which Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar and PsycINFO were searched for publications that reported SMRs for all-cause mortality among community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. Meta-analyses of SMRs were conducted, pooled across genders and then separately by gender. Sub-group analyses were conducted for diagnostic group, global region, decade and risk of study bias.
   Results: We were able to include 34 studies covering 1,724,906 participants. The gender pooled SMR for schizophrenia and psychotic disorders was 3.08 (95%CI 2.88-3.31). Schizophrenia and broader psychotic disorders had similar SMRs. Stratification by decade of observation suggests that the difference in SMR is not declining and may possibly be widening. Analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: The appearance of a static or widening mortality gap over time between people with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders and the general population is of concern. However, whether it is an increase over time is unclear, as there are insufficient studies to confirm this.

AB  - The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor, is mostly associated with promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), its ligands include High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1), S-100 proteins and beta-sheet fibrils. The effects of several metals and metalloids on RAGE expression and activation have been recently studied: in vivo and in vitro exposure to methylmercury, selenium, zinc, manganese, and arsenic was associated with a variety of RAGE-related alterations and behavioral impairments, which are mostly dependent upon the administration procedure (local vs. systemic) and age during exposure. Recently, C. elegans has been proposed as a potential novel model for studying RAGE-related pathologies; preliminary data regarding such model and its potential contribution to the study of metal-induced RAGE-related pathologies are discussed.

AB  - The increased number of elderly people worldwide poses a major medical and socio-economic challenge: the search of strategies to combat the consequences of the aging process. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been pointed out as the leading causes of brain aging, which in turn alters the functionality of brain. In this context, decline in adult neurogenesis (AN), due to modifications in the neural progenitor stem cells (NSCs) and their microenvironment, is among the aging alterations contributing to cognitive decline. Therefore, the consumption or administration of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules, such as dietary polyphenols, is under study as a potential beneficial strategy for preventing brain aging alterations including AN decline. Polyphenols, through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, modulate several cascades and effectors involved in the regulation of AN (e.g., SIRT1, Wnt, NF-kappa B and Nrf2, among others). This work summarizes the latest discoveries regarding the mechanisms whereby polyphenols preserve AN and counteract the cognitive decline present in aging.

AB  - As rates of suicide continue to rise, there is urgent need for innovative approaches to better understand, predict, and care for those at high risk of suicide. Numerous mobile and sensor technology solutions have already been proposed, are in development, or are already available today. This review seeks to assess their clinical evidence and help the reader understand the current state of the field.
   Advances in smartphone sensing, machine learning methods, and mobile apps directed towards reducing suicide offer promising evidence; however, most of these innovative approaches are still nascent. Further replication and validation of preliminary results is needed.
   Whereas numerous promising mobile and sensor technology based solutions for real time understanding, predicting, and caring for those at highest risk of suicide are being studied today, their clinical utility remains largely unproven. However, given both the rapid pace and vast scale of current research efforts, we expect clinicians will soon see useful and impactful digital tools for this space within the next 2 to 5 years.

AB  - There is a growing consensus that social cognition and behavior emerge from interactions across distributed regions of the "social brain". Researchers have traditionally focused their attention on functional response properties of these gray matter networks and neglected the vital role of white matter connections in establishing such networks and their functions. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of prior research on structural connectivity in social neuroscience and highlight the importance of this literature in clarifying brain mechanisms of social cognition. We pay particular attention to three key social processes: face processing, embodied cognition, and theory of mind, and their respective underlying neural networks. To fully identify and characterize the anatomical architecture of these networks, we further implement probabilistic tractography on a large sample of diffusion-weighted imaging data. The combination of an in-depth literature review and the empirical investigation gives us an unprecedented, well-defined landscape of white matter pathways underlying major social brain networks. Finally, we discuss current problems in the field, outline suggestions for best practice in diffusion-imaging data collection and analysis, and offer new directions for future research.

AB  - Aim: Anticonvulsant medications are frequently used in clinical practice to treat psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, but the evidence for their efficacy is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed the psychiatric benefit of anticonvulsants in patients under 18 years of age.
   Method: The Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched for peer-reviewed primary publications of RCTs with a minimum of 10 patients per treatment arm through December 2017.
   Results: Out of 355 identified non-duplicative publications, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Most RCTs were to treat bipolar disorder (n = 12) or manage recurrent aggression (n = 9). Few (n = 3) had both a multisite design and adequate statistical power. Valproate was the most frequently studied anticonvulsant (n = 15). Out of three placebo-controlled RCTs of valproate in bipolar disorder, none showed efficacy. In four RCTs, valproate was inferior to the antipsychotic risperidone. In several small, single-site RCTs, valproate and sulthiame were better than placebo for the management of recurrent aggression.
   Conclusions: Currently available RCTs do not support the efficacy of anticonvulsants as mood stabilizers in children. There is some preliminary evidence from small RCTs of the efficacy of some anticonvulsants in the control of aggression and behavioral dyscontrol in conduct disorder, autism, and intellectual disability.

AB  - Dynamic metabolic changes occurring in neurons are critically important in directing brain plasticity and cognitive function. In other tissue types, disruptions to metabolism and the resultant changes in cellular oxidative state, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) or induction of hypoxia, are associated with cellular stress. In the brain however, where drastic metabolic shifts occur to support physiological processes, subsequent changes to cellular oxidative state and induction of transcriptional sensors of oxidative stress likely play a significant role in regulating physiological neuronal function. Understanding the role of metabolism and metabolically-regulated genes in neuronal function will be critical in elucidating how cognitive functions are disrupted in pathological conditions where neuronal metabolism is affected. Here, we discuss known mechanisms regulating neuronal metabolism as well as the role of hypoxia and oxidative stress during normal and disrupted neuronal function. We also summarize recent studies implicating a role for metabolism in regulating neuronal plasticity as an emerging neuroscience paradigm.

AB  - Background: A systematic attempt to summarize the literature that examines working conditions and occupational health among immigrant in Europe and Canada.
   Methods: We established inclusion criteria, searched systematically for articles included in the Medline, Embase and Social Sciences Citation Index databases in the period 2000-2016 and checked the reference lists of all included papers.
   Results: Eighty-two studies were included in this review; 90% were cross-sectional and 80% were based on self-report. Work injuries were consistently found to be more prevalent among immigrants in studies from different countries and in studies with different designs. The prevalence of perceived discrimination or bullying was found to be consistently higher among immigrant workers than among natives. In general, however, we found that the evidence that immigrant workers are more likely to be exposed to physical or chemical hazards and poor psychosocial working conditions is very limited. A few Scandinavian studies support the idea that occupational factors may partly contribute to the higher risk of sick leave or disability pension observed among immigrants. However, the evidence for working conditions as a potential mediator of the associations between immigrant status and poor general health and mental distress was very limited.
   Conclusion: Some indicators suggest that immigrant workers in Europe and Canada experience poorer working conditions and occupational health than do native workers. However, the ability to draw conclusions is limited by the large gaps in the available data, heterogeneity of immigrant working populations, and the lack of prospectively designed cohort studies.

AB  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata var. radiata) is a key legume crop grown predominantly in South and Southeast Asia. Biotic and abiotic stresses cause significant yield reduction in mungbean, and among these, fungal diseases are particularly important. Although disease management practices, including physical, chemical, and biological methods have been researched and described in the literature, few of these are available or have been used by growers. Here we review the economic impact, and sustainable management options for the soil-borne and foliar fungal diseases of mungbean as well as major challenges to manage these diseases. Potential use of all possible components of integrated management practices including host resistance, fungicides, biocontrol agents, natural plant products, and cultural practices etc. are discussed. Major diseases include powdery mildew, anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, Rhizoctonia root rot and web blight, Macrophomina charcoal rot/dry root rot and blight. Review of the literature indicated an absence of resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot, little sources of resistance for dry root rot and anthracnose. Major resistant genes (R genes) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot, which may be potentially used in Marker assisted selection (MAS). Although the mechanisms of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by biocontrol agents have been studied with Macrophomina blight, there is little information on the mechanisms and use of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in managing fungal diseases of mungbean. Several studies targeted exploiting biological control for soil-borne root rot diseases. Botanical products, such as plant extracts, are also found effective to manage root and foliar diseases. However, many of these studies were limited to laboratory and/or green house experiments. Thus, long-term field studies are required for further exploitation of biological methods and commercial applications.

AB  - There is a growing use of novel psychoactive substances containing synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoid products have effects similar to those of natural cannabis, yet, these drugs are more potent and dangerous, and have been associated with dangerous adverse effects. Here, we review current literature on the epidemiology, acute, and chronic effects of synthetic and natural cannabinoid-based drugs. Synthetic drugs contain a mixture of psychoactive compounds that mostly bind cannabinoid receptors with high potency. These synthetic drugs replicate the effects of natural cannabis and 1 9-tetrahydrocannabinol but they induce more severe adverse effects including respiratory difficulties, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and cognitive impairment. Chronic use of synthetic cannabinoids has been associated with serious psychiatric and medical conditions and even death. Given the growing popularity in the use of cannabinoid-based drugs and their harmful potential, there is a need for further research in this field.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting about 6.3 million people worldwide. PD is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting into severe motor symptoms. The cellular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic cell death in PD are still not fully understood, but mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD cases. Aberrant post-translational modifications, namely glycation and glycosylation, together with age-dependent insufficient endogenous scavengers and quality control systems, lead to cellular overload of dysfunctional proteins. Such injuries accumulate with time and may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and exacerbated inflammatory responses, culminating in neuronal cell death. Here, we will discuss how PD-linked protein mutations, aging, impaired quality control mechanisms and sugar metabolism lead to up-regulated abnormal post-translational modifications in proteins. Abnormal glycation and glycosylation seem to be more common than previously thought in PD and may underlie mitochondria-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in a feed-forward mechanism. Moreover, the stress-induced post-translational modifications that directly affect parkin and/or its substrates, deeply impairing its ability to regulate mitochondrial dynamics or to suppress inflammation will also be discussed. Together, these represent still unexplored deleterious mechanisms implicated in neurodegeneration in PD, which may be used for a more in-depth knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms, or as biomarkers of the disease.

AB  - Despite abundant research into the neurobiology of mental disorders, to date neurobiological insights have had very little impact on psychiatric diagnosis or treatment. In this review, we contend that the search for neuroimaging biomarkers-neuromarkers-of mental disorders is a highly promising avenue toward improved psychiatric healthcare. However, many of the traditional tools used for psychiatric neuroimaging are inadequate for the identification of neuromarkers. Specifically, we highlight the need for larger samples and for multivariate analysis. Approaches such as machine learning are likely to be beneficial for interrogating high-dimensional neuroimaging data. We suggest that broad, population-based study designs will be important for developing neuromarkers of mental disorders, and will facilitate a move away from a phenomenological definition of mental disorder categories and toward psychiatric nosology based on biological evidence. We provide an outline of how the development of neuromarkers should occur, emphasizing the need for tests of external and construct validity, and for collaborative research efforts. Finally, we highlight some concerns regarding the development, and use of, neuromarkers in psychiatric healthcare.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a popular new-type psychostimulant drug with complicated neurotoxicity. In spite of mounting evidence on METH-induced damage of neural cell, the accurate mechanism of toxic effect of the drug on central nervous system (CNS) has not yet been completely deciphered. Besides, effective treatment strategies toward METH neurotoxicity remain scarce and more efficacious drugs are to be developed. In this review, we summarize cellular and molecular bases that might contribute to METH-elicited neurotoxicity, which mainly include oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. We also discuss some drugs that protect neural cells suffering from METH-induced neurotoxic consequences. We hope more in-depth investigations of exact details that how METH produces toxicity in CNS could be carried out in future and the development of new drugs as natural compounds and immunotherapies, including clinic trials, are expected.

AB  - Background
   It is a widespread opinion that after treatment with psychotherapy, patients with anxiety disorders maintain their gains beyond the active treatment period, whereas patients treated with medication soon experience a relapse after treatment termination.
   Aims
   We aimed to provide evidence on whether enduring effects of psychotherapy differ from control groups.
   Method
   We searched 93 randomised controlled studies with 152 study arms of psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioural therapy or other psychotherapies) for panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder that included follow-up assessments. In a meta-analysis, pre-post effect sizes for end-point and all follow-up periods were calculated and compared with control groups (medication: n = 16 study arms; pill and psychological placebo groups: n = 17 study arms).
   Results
   Gains with psychotherapy were maintained for up to 24 months. For cognitive-behavioural therapy, we observed a significant improvement over time. However, patients in the medication group remained stable during the treatment-free period, with no significant difference when compared with psychotherapy. Patients in the placebo group did not deteriorate during follow-up, but showed significantly worse outcomes than patients in cognitive-behavioural therapy.
   Conclusions
   Not only psychotherapy, but also medications and, to a lesser extent, placebo conditions have enduring effects. Long-lasting treatment effects observed in the follow-up period may be superimposed by effects of spontaneous remission or regression to the mean.

AB  - The present review aimed to 1) identify what sleep disturbances co-occur alongside psychotic-like, dissociative and hypomanic experiences; 2) assess the strength of potential associations between the severity of sleep disturbances and of the experiences studied; and 3) appraise evidence for a causal link. MedLine and PsycInfo were searched and 44 studies were deemed eligible.
   Results showed that insomnia was associated with all individual psychotic-like, dissociative and hypomanic experiences reviewed (effect size range: small-to-large). Parasomnias were associated with all psychotic-like experiences; however, there was evidence of variation in magnitude between individual experiences. An eveningness chronotype was associated with dissociative and hypomanic experiences, and circadian dysrhythmia was found alongside hypomania but not the other experiences reviewed.
   Finally, experimental sleep manipulation studies revealed a potential causal link between sleep loss and psychotic-like and dissociative experiences, although size and consistency of effects varied by specific experience. Future research, using experimental manipulations of sleep to address putative mechanisms, will enable questions of causality to be answered with more confidence.

AB  - Specialized treatments for personality disorder are usually offered late in the course of the disorder, to a small number of help-seeking individuals with entrenched disability. Intervention during the early stages of personality disorder might help to decrease the persistence and/or the severity of personality disorder and to prevent the cascading of secondary psychopathology and psychosocial disability. Research regarding the understanding of and appropriate treatment for early stage personality disorder is growing. However, there is still a lack of clarity in the field about what constitutes early intervention and how it might relate to early intervention for other mental disorders. Also, there is little research on how to design integrated early intervention services suitable for personality and other mental disorders or on the long-term effects of early intervention.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system, which is characterized by movement disorders, such as static tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia in advanced patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, such as gastric dysmotility, constipation, and anorectic dysfunction, is common non-motor symptom in the early stage of PD. The progression of PD includes the degenerative loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra (SN). Interestingly, both of them are also present in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of PD patients. In this review, we describe the relationship between non motor symptoms particularly GI dysfunction and the pathogenesis of PD, aiming to show the powerful evidences about the prion-like propagation of alpha-synuclein and support the hypothesis of gut-brain axis in PD. We then summarize the mechanism of the gut-brain axis and confirm alpha-synuclein as a potential target for drug design or new clinical treatment.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of the literature on correlates/predictors of mobility limitation among community-dwelling U.S. Hispanic older adults. A search of scientific databases (PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) was conducted. After abstract and full text review, 20 epidemiologic studies that met all eligibility criteria were included. The theoretical framework of mobility was used to categorize factors related to mobility limitation. The majority of the studies reviewed (n = 17) examined some aspect of physical factors in relation to mobility limitation. Several factors emerged as important influences on mobility outcomes: diabetes mellitus, stroke, obesity, arthritis, and depression. None examined the influence of built environment. This review suggests that multilevel factors can impact both mobility limitations and disability among U.S. Hispanic older adults. However, the study findings were inconsistent, with some studies showing significant relationships or effects and others demonstrating no associations or mixed findings.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The value of early intervention in psychosis and allocation of public resources has long been debated because outcomes in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have remained suboptimal.
   OBJECTIVE To compare early intervention services (EIS) with treatment as usual (TAU) for early-phase psychosis.
   DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials. gov without language restrictions through June 6, 2017.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials comparing EIS vs TAU in first-episode psychosis or early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This systematic reviewwas conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Three independent investigators extracted data for a random-effects meta-analysis and prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomeswere all-cause treatment discontinuation and at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization during the treatment period.
   RESULTS Across 10 randomized clinical trials (mean [SD] trial duration, 16.2 [7.4] months; range, 9-24 months) among 2176 patients (mean [SD] age, 27.5 [4.6] years; 1355 [62.3%] male), EIS was associated with better outcomes than TAU at the end of treatment for all 13 meta-analyzable outcomes. These outcomes included the following: all-cause treatment discontinuation (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.80; P <.001), at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90; P =.003), involvement in school or work (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24; P =.01), total symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.32; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.17; P <.001), positive symptom severity (SMD, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.11; P <.001), and negative symptom severity (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.14; P <.001). Superiority of EIS regarding all outcomes was evident at 6, 9 to 12, and 18 to 24 months of treatment (except for general symptom severity and depressive symptom severity at 18-24 months).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In early-phase psychosis, EIS are superior to TAU across all meta-analyzable outcomes. These results support the need for funding and use of EIS in patients with early-phase psychosis.

AB  - Purpose of Review In the face of rising water demands and dwindling freshwater supplies, alternative water sources are needed. Desalination of water has become a key to helping meet increasing water needs, especially in water-stressed countries where water obtained by desalination far exceeds supplies from the freshwater sources.
   Recent Findings Recent technological advancements have enabled desalination to become more efficient and cost-competitive on a global scale. This has become possible due to the improvement in the materials used in membrane-based desalination, incorporation of energy-recovery devices to reduce electricity demands, and combining different desalination methods into hybrid designs. Further, there has been a gradual phasing-in of renewable energy sources to power desalination plants, which will help ensure the long-term sustainability of desalination. However, there are still challenges of reducing energy demands and managing waste products from the desalination to prevent adverse environmental effects.
   Summary This article reviews the history, location, components, costs, and other facets of desalination and summarizes the new technologies that are set to improve the overall efficiency of the desalination process.

AB  - People differ significantly in their response to psychological intervention, with some benefitting more from treatment than others. According to the recently proposed theoretical framework of vantage sensitivity, some of this variability may be due to individual differences in environmental sensitivity, the inherent ability to register, and process external stimuli. In this paper, we apply the vantage sensitivity framework to the field of psychiatry and clinical psychology, proposing that some people are more responsive to the positive effects of psychological intervention due to heightened sensitivity.
   After presenting theoretical frameworks related to environmental sensitivity, we review a selection of recent studies reporting individual differences in the positive response to psychological intervention.
   A growing number of studies report that some people benefit more from psychological intervention than others as a function of genetic, physiological, and psychological characteristics. These studies support the vantage sensitivity proposition that treatment response is influenced by factors associated with heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. More recently, studies have also shown that sensitivity can be measured with a short questionnaire which appears to predict the response to psychological intervention.
   Vantage sensitivity is a framework with significant relevance for our understanding of widely observed heterogeneity in treatment response. It suggests that variability in response to treatment is partly influenced by people's differing capacity for environmental sensitivity, which can be measured with a short questionnaire. Application of the vantage sensitivity framework to psychiatry and clinical psychology may improve our knowledge regarding when, how, and for whom interventions work.

AB  - Prematurity is a known risk factor for later cognitive deficits. At present there are neither behavioral nor neurological tests available to detect those preterm infants who would benefit most from early interventions. Neurophysiologic methods, and more specifically, auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) are convenient tools to investigate early cognitive functioning. However, the capability of AERPs as a prognostic factor for mental development in preterm infants remains unclear. The present systematic search of the literature yielded 1016 articles, out of which 13 were included. Both prospective and cross-sectional studies reported a relationship between AERPs and cognitive outcome. Our results show that larger amplitudes and shorter latencies of late AERPs are related to better cognitive outcomes. Additional studies are needed to corroborate our findings regarding this potential use of AERPs in the individual evaluation of preterm born infants.

AB  - Background. Humanitarian emergencies can impact people's psychosocial well-being and mental health. Providing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) is an essential component of humanitarian aid responses. However, factors influencing the delivery MHPSS programmes have yet to be synthesised. We undertook a systematic review on the barriers to, and facilitators of, implementing and receiving MHPSS programmes delivered to populations affected by humanitarian emergencies in low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods. A comprehensive search of 12 bibliographic databases, 25 websites and citation checking was undertaken. Studies published in English from 1980 onwards were included if they contained evidence on the perspectives of adults or children who had engaged in or programmes providers involved in delivering, MHPSS programmes in humanitarian settings. Thirteen studies were critically appraised and analysed thematically.
   Results. Community engagement was a key mechanism to support the successful implementation and uptake of MHPSS programmes. Establishing good relationships with parents may also be important when there is a need to communicate the value of children and young people's participation in programmes. Sufficient numbers of trained providers were essential in ensuring a range of MHPSS programmes were delivered as planned but could be challenging in resource-limited settings. Programmes need to be socially and culturally meaningful to ensure they remain appealing. Recipients also valued engagement with peers in group-based programmes and trusting and supportive relationships with providers.
   Conclusion. The synthesis identified important factors that could improve MHPSS programme reach and appeal. Taking these factors into consideration could support future MHPSS programmes achieve their intended aims.

AB  - Multiple changes are influencing work, workplaces and workers in the US including shifts in the main types of work and the rise of the 'gig' economy. Work and workplace changes have coincided with a decline in unions and associated advocacy for improved safety and health conditions. Risk assessment has been the primary method to inform occupational and environmental health policy and management for many types of hazards. Although often focused on one hazard at a time, risk assessment frameworks and methods have advanced toward cumulative risk assessment recognizing that exposure to a single chemical or non-chemical stressor rarely occurs in isolation. We explore how applying cumulative risk approaches may change the roles of workers and employers as they pursue improved health and safety and elucidate some of the challenges and opportunities that might arise. Application of cumulative risk assessment should result in better understanding of complex exposures and health risks with the potential to inform more effective controls and improved safety and health risk management overall. Roles and responsibilities of both employers and workers are anticipated to change with potential for a greater burden of responsibility on workers to address risk factors both inside and outside the workplace that affect health at work. A range of policies, guidance and training have helped develop cumulative risk assessment for the environmental health field and similar approaches are available to foster the practice in occupational safety and health.

AB  - Managers are in an influential position to make decisions that can impact on the mental health and well-being of their employees. As a result, there is an increasing trend for organisations to provide managers with training in how to reduce work-based mental health risk factors for their employees. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify workplace interventions for managers with an emphasis on the mental health of employees reporting directing to them. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled effect sizes using the random effects model for both manager and employee outcomes. Ten controlled trials were identified as relevant for this review. Outcomes evaluating managers' mental health knowledge (standardised mean difference (SMD)=0.73; 95%CI 0.43 to 1.03; p<0.001), non-stigmatising attitudes towards mental health (SMD=0.36; 95%CI 0.18 to 0.53; p<0.001) and improving behaviour in supporting employees experiencing mental health problems (SMD=0.59; 95%CI 0.14 to 1.03; p=0.01) were found to have significant pooled effect sizes favouring the intervention. A significant pooled effect was not found for the small number of studies evaluating psychological symptoms in employees (p=0.28). Our meta-analysis indicates that training managers in workplace mental health can improve their knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviour in supporting employees experiencing mental health problems. At present, any findings regarding the impact of manager training on levels of psychological distress among employees remain preliminary as only a very limited amount of research evaluating employee outcomes is available. Our review suggests that in order to understand the effectiveness of manager training on employees, an increase in collection of employee level data is required.

AB  - Over the last fifteen years, the emerging field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has described the relatively late development of prefrontal cortex in children and the relation between gradual structural changes and children's protracted development of prefrontal-dependent skills. Widespread recognition by the broader scientific community of the extended development of prefrontal cortex has led to the overwhelming perception of prefrontal cortex as a "late developing" region of the brain. However, despite its supposedly protracted development, multiple lines of research have converged to suggest that prefrontal cortex development may be particularly susceptible to individual differences in children's early environments. Recent studies demonstrate that the impacts of early adverse environments on prefrontal cortex are present very early in development: within the first year of life. This review provides a comprehensive overview of new neuroimaging evidence demonstrating that prefrontal cortex should be characterized as a "rapidly developing" region of the brain, discusses the converging impacts of early adversity on prefrontal circuits, and presents potential mechanisms via which adverse environments shape both concurrent and long-term measures of prefrontal cortex development. Given that environmentally-induced disparities are present in prefrontal cortex development within the first year of life, translational work in intervention and/or prevention science should focus on intervening early in development to take advantages of this early period of rapid prefrontal development and heightened plasticity.

AB  - Transgender and gender variant (GV) youth experience elevated risk for poor health and academic outcomes due mainly to social experiences of stigma and discrimination. To supplement the growing evidence on health risks encountered by transgender/GV youth, we identified factors theorized to be protective for these youth across all four levels of Bronfenbrenner's socioecological model (individual, relationship, community, societal). We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed research. The articles included in this review were published in peer-reviewed journals in English or Spanish between 1999 and 2014, analyzed data from a sample or subsample of transgender or GV participants with a mean age between 10 and 24 years, and examined the relationship of at least one theorized protective factor to a health or behavioral outcome. Twenty-one articles met inclusion criteria. Transgender/GV youth in included articles ranged from 11 to 26 years of age, were racially/ethnically diverse, and represented varied gender identities. Within these articles, 27 unique protective factors across four levels of the ecological model were identified as related to positive health and well-being. Self-esteem at the individual level, healthy relationships with parents and peers at the relationship-level, and gay-straight alliances at the community level emerged as protective factors across multiple studies. Our findings underscore the relative lack of research on transgender/GV youth and protective factors. Novel recruitment strategies for transgender/GV youth and better measurement of transgender identities are needed to confirm these protective relationships and identify others. Growth in these areas will contribute to building a body of evidence to inform interventions.

AB  - A systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate whether an insecure attachment style is associated with greater anthropomorphic tendencies. We searched eight electronic databases and checked reference lists for eligible studies. After removing duplicates, 1022 titles and abstracts were appraised for eligibility. Eligible studies were those that assessed insecure attachment and anthropomorphism of non-living entities, presented original data, contained sufficient data for computing effect sizes, and were written in English. We deemed 30 articles potentially eligible and read their full texts. Six studies were eligible, with a total of 1341 participants. A quality assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Two independent raters achieved 85% agreement on the quality appraisal of the studies. The quality of the included studies was poor, with 10.7% of items coded zero (did not meet criterion at all), and an overall average quality rating of 60%. A narrative review of the eligible studies highlighted that anxious attachment and anthropomorphic tendencies are positively and moderately related, but that attachment avoidance is not related to anthropomorphism. Given the poor quality of the research to date, better quality research is needed to more conclusively establish whether and how insecure attachment styles are related to anthropomorphic tendencies.

AB  - The use of technology in intervention is not uncommon for improving emotion recognition of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in emotion recognition in people with ASD. After searching six electronic databases, 15 studies published from 2000 to 2016 were yielded and reviewed. Eight technology-based interventions for improving emotion recognition skills in people with ASD were identified. Overall, this review provides preliminary evidence that the use of technology-based intervention with coach support and emphasis on facial features can improve emotion recognition in children and adolescents with ASD. Factors which need to be considered in order to confirm the effectiveness of various intervention programs were discussed.

AB  - Due to the increasing reliance on teamwork in the modern work environment featured by its fast pace and high pressure, research on how work teams perceive and manage stress has garnered growing attention. In an attempt to synthesize this literature, we summarized team stress research ranging from lab studies on ad hoc teams to field studies on intact work groups. We posited that research on team stress could benefit from an integrative overview of the theories and findings regarding teams' reactions to stressors and their downstream consequences. Accordingly, we reviewed major theoretical frameworks used to explain perceptions and effects of stress in work teams. We then focused on empirical research that examined mediators and/or moderators of the team level stressor-strain relationships, due to their enhanced ability to inform underlying mechanisms. Finally, we concluded our review by proposing new theoretical directions to help guide further advancements in team stress research.

AB  - We have a limited understanding of the role of exercise on memory function among those with Parkinson's disease (PD). This review discusses the mechanisms influencing PD, examines the extent and mechanisms through which exercise can reduce the risk of developing PD, details the extent and mechanisms through which exercise is associated with memory function among PD, and indicates the effects of exercise on various non-memory outcomes among PD patients. A narrative and systematic review approach was employed. We specifically highlight the role of dopamine in PD; indicate the protective effect of exercise in reducing PD risk, which may occur from exercise-induced alterations in dopamine levels, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotrophic factor levels; detail the literature (in human and animal models) demonstrating that exercise can enhance memory function among PD patients, which may occur from exercise-induced changes in dopamine and modulation of mechanisms associated with memory (e.g., AMPA and NMDA receptor expression); and demonstrate that regular exercise engagement (including various exercise modalities) among PD patients can improve motor function, psychological function, and prevent early mortality. Exercise may be a putative strategy to help prevent PD and treat the memory impairment associated with PD. Recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) are complex and multidimensional disorders with high heritability rates. The contribution of genetic factors to the etiology of these disorders is increasingly being recognized as the action of multiple risk variants with small effect sizes, which might explain only a minor part of susceptibility. On the other site, numerous environmental factors have been found to play an important role in their causality. Therefore, in recent years, several studies focused on gene x environment interactions that are believed to bridge the gap between genetic underpinnings and environmental insults. In this article, we performed a systematic review of studies investigating gene x environment interactions in BD and schizophrenia spectrum phenotypes. In the majority of studies from this field, interacting effects of variation in genes encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) have been explored. Almost consistently, these studies revealed that polymorphisms in COMT, BDNF, and FKBP5 genes might interact with early life stress and cannabis abuse or dependence, influencing various outcomes of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and BD. Other interactions still require further replication in larger clinical and non-clinical samples. In addition, future studies should address the direction of causality and potential mechanisms of the relationship between gene x environment interactions and various categories of outcomes in schizophrenia and BD.

AB  - Background Regular physical activity is important for maintaining physical and mental health. Benefits are optimized when physical activity is maintained. Understanding causal mechanisms is important to inform future interventions.
   Purpose To investigate mediators of physical activity maintenance.
   Methods Six databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science). Eligibility criteria included adult nonclinical populations, validated measure of physical activity behavior at baseline and at least 6 months postbaseline, control/comparison group(s), and reported mediators of physical activity behavior change. Mediators were examined according to (i) formal mediation tests, (ii) mediator association with physical activity outcome, and (iii) intervention effects on mediators.
   Results There were few formal mediation tests conducted (n = 12/39 included studies), and various other methodological limitations were identified. There was some evidence that effective mediators in formal mediation tests at 6 months and later included the "behavioral processes of change" (n = 5/6). Many of the included interventions were not effective for changing targeted mediators (only 34% of 413 tests of mediator changes were significant).
   Conclusions There were a number of methodological and statistical limitations in the evidence base. In future, prespecified formal mediation tests should be carried out and could be aided by a formal framework. Social and environmental variables should be considered in addition to intrapersonal variables. Improving knowledge of how to change hypothesized mediators, based on theory and evidence, will reveal how physical activity behavior change maintenance can be achieved. Maintenance research would be enhanced by establishing a formal definition of behavior change "maintenance."

AB  - Aims: In light of the rise in research on technological addictions and smartphone addiction in particular, the aim of this paper was to review the relevant literature on the topic of smartphone addiction and determine whether this disorder exists or if it does not adequately satisfy the criteria for addiction. Methods: We reviewed quantitative and qualitative studies on smartphone addiction and analyzed their methods and conclusions to make a determination on the suitability of the diagnosis "addiction" to excessive and problematic smartphone use. Results: Although the majority of research in the field declares that smartphones are addictive or takes the existence of smartphone addiction as granted, we did not find sufficient support from the addiction perspective to confirm the existence of smartphone addiction at this time. The behaviors observed in the research could be better labeled as problematic or maladaptive smartphone use and their consequences do not meet the severity levels of those caused by addiction. Discussion and conclusions: Addiction is a disorder with severe effects on physical and psychological health. A behavior may have a similar presentation as addiction in terms of excessive use, impulse control problems, and negative consequences, but that does not mean that it should be considered an addiction. We propose moving away from the addiction framework when studying technological behaviors and using other terms such as "problematic use" to describe them. We recommend that problematic technology use is to be studied in its sociocultural context with an increased focus on its compensatory functions, motivations, and gratifications.

AB  - To identify measurement tools which screen for the presence of fear of birth (FOB) and to determine the most effective tool/s for use in clinical practice.
   Fear or birth (FOB) is internationally recognised as a cause for increasing concern, despite a lack of consensus on a definition or optimal measure of assessment. There is a wide array of FOB measurement tools, however little clarity on which tool should be used to screen for FOB in clinical practice. This review explores the use of tools that are used to screen for FOB and discusses the perceived effectiveness of such tools.
   A structured literature review was undertaken. Electronic databases were searched in July 2017 and manuscripts reviewed for quality. The review included 46 papers. The majority of studies were undertaken in Scandinavia (n = 29) and a range of tools were used to measure FOB. The most widely used tool was the Wilma Delivery Expectancy Experience Questionnaire' (W-DEQ). Inconsistencies were found in the way this tool was used, including variations in assessment cut-off points, implementation and use across a range of cultural settings and women of varying gestations. Moreover, the tool may be too lengthy to use in clinical practice. The Fear of Birth Scale (FOBS) has been shown to be as effective as W-DEQ but has the advantage of being short and easy to administer.
   The inconsistencies in tools reflect the difficulties in defining FOB. A clear consensus definition of FOB would aid comparisons across practice and research. The W-DEQ is not used in clinical practice; this may be due to its length and complexity. The FOBS is likely to be a more versatile tool that can be used in clinical practice.

KW  - Stress factors
KW  - Stress consequences
AB  - Organizations have increasingly sought to adopt innovative interventions to prevent stress-related issues. In the field of manufacturing, however, the effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear because a systematic and specific review of existing primary evidence has not been undertaken. The present systematic literature review sought to address the foregoing limitation in the literature by summarizing the main source of stress and effectiveness of stress management interventions as grounded in the context of manufacturing. Our review was limited to only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies and concerned employees from the manufacturing sector. Twenty-two studies on primary, secondary and tertiary interventions across four continents (Asia, Europe, USA and South America) were selected and analyzed in terms of stress factors, methodological properties and outcomes. Most of these were RCT studies (68% Vs 32%) with a majority of secondary interventions (N = 11, 50%), followed by primary (N = 5, 22%), tertiary (N = 3, 13%), and two (9%) mixed interventions. The main outcomes included an improvement of psychological wellbeing, decreased stress reactivity and an increment of general health. There was a predominance of interventions utilizing skills programs and/or cognitive-behavioral techniques. The main source of stress reported related to professional identity, organizational deficiencies, interpersonal conflicts, physical complaints and poor work environment. Taken together, the findings provide important theoretical and practical implications for advancing the study of stress factors and the use of stress management interventions in the workplace. The prerequisite for a successful intervention is to address the real problems experienced by professionals and help them to cope with their difficult situations. The strategy of "bottom-up" offers a potential means of enhancing employees' health and well-being; however, the most effective means of implementing these interventions needs to be understood better.

AB  - Objective African-American children and adolescents experience an undue burden of disease for many health outcomes compared to their White peers. More research needs to be completed for this priority population to improve their health outcomes and ameliorate health disparities. Integrating hip hop music or hip hop dance into interventions may help engage African-American youth in health interventions and improve their health outcomes. We conducted a review of the literature to characterize hip hop interventions and determine their potential to improve health.
   Methods We searched Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE to identify studies that assessed hip hop interventions. To be included, studies had to (1) be focused on a psychosocial or physical health intervention that included hip hop and (2) present quantitative data assessing intervention outcomes. Twenty-three articles were identified as meeting all inclusion criteria and were coded by two reviewers. Articles were assessed with regards to sample characteristics, study design, analysis, intervention components, and results.
   Results Hip hop interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, health behavior, and mental health. The interventions were primarily targeted to African-American and Latino children and adolescents. Many of the health literacy and mental health studies used non-experimental study designs. Among the 12 (of 14) health behavior studies that used experimental designs, the association between hip hop interventions and positive health outcomes was inconsistent.
   Conclusions The number of experimental hip hop intervention studies is limited. Future research is required to determine if hip hop interventions can promote health.

AB  - To clarify the relationship between the concepts of management, administration, and leadership in psychiatry. The authors provide a review of the conceptual evolution of administrative psychiatry and develop operational definitions of these three domains. Based upon their experiences, they discuss relevant core competencies and personal attributes. The authors found that the terms psychiatric management, psychiatric administration, and psychiatric leadership are often used interchangeably, yet they each have a different and distinct focus. Additionally, some in the field consider the concepts overlapping, existing on a continuum, while others draw distinct conceptual boundaries between these terms. Psychiatrists in leadership positions function in all three domains. While these are distinct concepts, the authors recommend that administrative psychiatrists integrate all three in their everyday work. The authors suggest the distinctions among these concepts should inform training and identify core competencies related to these distinctions. Mentoring should focus on the practical integration of the concepts of management, administration, and leadership in administrative psychiatry. The authors present a cohesive framework for future development of a curriculum for education and research.

AB  - Objective Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a nonpharmacological technique used to stimulate the brain. It is a safe and proven alternative tool to treat resistant major depressive disorders (MDDs). Neuroimaging studies suggest a wide corticolimbic network is involved in MDDs. We researched observable changes in magnetic resonance imaging induced by rTMS to clarify the operational mechanism.
   Methods A systematic search of the international literature was performed using PubMed and Embase, using papers published up to January 1, 2017. The following MESH terms were used: (depression or major depressive disorder) and (neuroimaging or MRI) and (rTMS or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). We searched the databases using a previously defined strategy to identify potentially eligible studies.
   Results Both structural and functional changes were observed on magnetic resonance imagings performed before and after rTMS. Various areas of the brain were impacted when rTMS was used. Although the results were very heterogeneous, a pattern that involved the anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex emerged. These are known to be regions of interest in MDDs. However, the various parameters used in rTMS make any generalization difficult.
   Conclusions Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation helps to treat MDDs with good efficacy. Its effect on the brain, as observed in several neuroimaging studies, seems to impact on the structural and functional features of several networks and structures involved in major depressive disorders.

AB  - Clinical and molecular genetics have advanced current knowledge on genetic disorders associated with autism. A review of diverse genetic disorders associated with autism is presented and for the first time discussed extensively with regard to possible common underlying mechanisms leading to a similar cognitive-behavioral phenotype of autism. The possible role of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including epigenetic mechanisms, is in particular examined. Finally, the pertinence of distinguishing non-syndromic autism (isolated autism) from syndromic autism (autism associated with genetic disorders) will be reconsidered. Given the high genetic and etiological heterogeneity of autism, autism can be viewed as a behavioral syndrome related to known genetic disorders (syndromic autism) or currently unknown disorders (apparent non-syndromic autism), rather than a specific categorical mental disorder. It highlights the need to study autism phenotype and developmental trajectory through a multidimensional, non-categorical approach with multivariate analyses within autism spectrum disorder but also across mental disorders, and to conduct systematically clinical genetic examination searching for genetic disorders in all individuals (children but also adults) with autism.

AB  - Methylene blue (MB) is a well-established drug with a long history of use, owing to its diverse range of use and its minimal side effect profile. MB has been used classically for the treatment of malaria, methemoglobinemia, and carbon monoxide poisoning, as well as a histological dye. Its role in the mitochondria, however, has elicited much of its renewed interest in recent years. MB can reroute electrons in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain directly from NADH to cytochrome c, increasing the activity of complex IV and effectively promoting mitochondrial activity while mitigating oxidative stress. In addition to its beneficial effect on mitochondrial protection, MB is also known to have robust effects in mitigating neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as a seemingly unifying pathological phenomenon across a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders, which thus positions methylene blue as a promising therapeutic. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, MB has shown impressive efficacy in mitigating neurodegeneration and the accompanying behavioral phenotypes in animal models for such conditions as stroke, global cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. This review summarizes recent work establishing MB as a promising candidate for neuroprotection, with particular emphasis on the contribution of mitochondrial function to neural health. Furthermore, this review will briefly examine the link between MB, neurogenesis, and improved cognition in respect to age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) usually starts during adolescence and is associated with an array of psychological and psychiatric symptoms and future suicide attempts. The aim of this study is to determine prospective predictors, mediators and moderators of NSSI in adolescent community samples in order to target prevention and treatment strategies. Two team members searched online databases independently. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review. Several variables were seen to prospectively predict NSSI: female gender, family-related variables, peer victimisation, depression, previous NSSI and self-concept. Few studies analysed mediators and moderators. Low self-concept was highlighted as a relevant moderator in the relationship between intra/interpersonal variables and NSSI. Implications of these findings are discussed. The considerable heterogeneity between studies posed a limitation to determine robust predictors of NSSI. Further prospective studies using standardised measures of predictors and outcomes are needed to ascertain the most at risk individuals and develop prevention strategies.

AB  - Entropy production rate is increased by several metabolic and thermodynamics abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Irreversible processes are quantified by changes in the entropy production rate. This review is focused on the opposing interactions observed in NDs between the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway and PPAR gamma and their metabolic and thermodynamic implications. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, WNT/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated, whereas PPAR gamma is downregulated. In Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, WNT/beta-catenin pathway is downregulated while PPAR gamma is upregulated. The dysregulation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway is responsible for the modification of thermodynamics behaviors of metabolic enzymes. Upregulation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway leads to aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activated enzymes, such as glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactic dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Downregulation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway leads to oxidative stress and cell death through inactivation of Glut, PKM2, PDK1, MCT-1, LDH-A but activation of PDH. In addition, in NDs, PPAR gamma is dysregulated, whereas it contributes to the regulation of several key circadian genes. NDs show many dysregulation in the mediation of circadian clock genes and so of circadian rhythms. Thermodynamics rhythms operate far-from-equilibrium and partly regulate interactions between WNT/beta-catenin pathway and PPAR gamma. In NDs, metabolism, thermodynamics and circadian rhythms are tightly interrelated.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders are common among patients with Parkinson's disease and may appear in any stage of the disease. However, these disorders often go undiagnosed and receive insufficient treatment. Observations in recent years have revealed that dopamine replacement therapy may lead to the development or worsening of conditions, such as gambling disorder, compulsive sexual behavior, compulsive buying and binge eating, in addition to punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. The pathophysiology of these disorders seems to be related to abnormal dopaminergic stimulation of the basal regions of the basal ganglia, especially via nigro-mesolimbic pathways. The aim of the present study was to perform a literature review on impulsivity, impulse control disorders and related conditions among patients with Parkinson's disease, with emphasis on their epidemiology, clinical characteristics and treatment.

AB  - Although it is widely believed that risk assessment tools can help manage risk of violence and offending, it is unclear what evidence exists to support this view. As such, we conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis. To identify studies, we searched 13 databases, reviewed reference lists, and contacted experts. Through this review, we identified 73 published and unpublished studies (N = 31,551 psychiatric patients and offenders, N = 10,002 professionals) that examined either professionals' risk management efforts following the use of a tool, or rates of violence or offending following the implementation of a tool. These studies included a variety of populations (e.g., adults, adolescents), tools, and study designs. The primary findings were as follows: (a) despite some promising findings, professionals do not consistently adhere to tools or apply them to guide their risk management efforts; (b) following the use of a tool, match to the risk principle is moderate and match to the needs principle is limited, as many needs remained unaddressed; (c) there is insufficient evidence to conclude that tools directly reduce violence or reoffending, as findings are mixed; and (d) tools appear to have a more beneficial impact on risk management when agencies use careful implementation procedures and provide staff with training and guidelines related to risk management. In sum, although risk assessment tools may be an important starting point, they do not guarantee effective treatment or risk management. However, certain strategies may bolster their utility.

AB  - Objectives: Multidisciplinary teams in mental health receive limited guidance, leading to inconsistent practices. We undertook a systematic review of the characteristics and practices of multidisciplinary team reviews for patients with severe mental illness or in relevant mental health service settings.
   Methods: Sources published since 2000 were located via academic database and web searches. Results were synthesised narratively.
   Results: A total of 14 sources were analysed. Important characteristics and practices identified included routine monitoring and evaluation, good communication, equality between team members, and clear documentation practices. Success factors included defined leadership and clear team goals. Four sources described considerations for patients with complex clinical needs, including allocating sufficient time for discussion, maintaining connections with community providers, and ensuring culturally sensitive practices.
   Conclusions: No single best practice model was found, due to variations in team caseload, casemix, and resourcing levels. However, key ingredients for success were proposed. Sources were mostly descriptive; there remains a lack of evidence-based guidance regarding multidisciplinary team review characteristics and practices.

AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Pharmacological animal models are invaluable tools to study the pathological mechanisms of PD. Currently, invertebrate and vertebrate animal models have been developed by using several main neurotoxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, paraquat, and rotenone. These models achieve to some extent to reproduce the key features of PD, including motor defects, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, and the formation of Lewy bodies. In this review, we will highlight the pathogenic mechanisms of those neurotoxins and summarize different neurotoxic animal models with the hope to help researchers choose among them accurately and to promote the development of modeling PD.

AB  - Executive functions and working memory are long known to involve the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and two PFC-projecting areas: midline/paramidline thalamus (MLT) and cornus ammonis 1 (CA1)/subiculum of the hippocampal formation (HF). An increasing number of rodent electrophysiology studies are examining these substrates together, thus providing circuit-level perspectives on input convergence, synaptic plasticity and functional coupling, as well as insights into cognition mechanisms and brain disorders. Our review article puts this literature into a method-oriented narrative. As revisited throughout the text, limbic thalamic and hippocampal afferents to the PFC gate one another's inputs, which in turn are modulated by PFC interneurons and ascending monoaminergic projections. In addition, long-term synaptic plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and event-related potentials (ERP) dynamically vary across PFC-related circuits during learning paradigms and drug effects. Finally, thalamic-prefrontal loops, which have been shown to amplify both cognitive processes and limbic seizures, are also being implicated as relays in the prefrontal-hippocampal feedback, contributing to spatial navigation and decision making. Based on these issues, we conclude the review with a critical synthesis and some research directions.

AB  - In recent years, several important advances have been made in our understanding of the pathways that lead to cell dysfunction and death in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Despite distinct clinical and pathological features, these two neurodegenerative diseases share critical processes, such as the presence of misfolded and/or aggregated proteins, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial anomalies. Even though the mitochondria are commonly regarded as the "powerhouses" of the cell, they are involved in a multitude of cellular events such as heme metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction play a key role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, further highlighting the importance of these organelles, especially in neurons. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity through different surveillance mechanisms is thus critical for neuron survival. Mitochondria display a wide range of quality control mechanisms, from the molecular to the organellar level. Interestingly, many of these lines of defense have been found to be altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and HD. Current knowledge and further elucidation of the novel pathways that protect the cell through mitochondrial quality control may offer unique opportunities for disease therapy in situations where ongoing mitochondrial damage occurs. In this review, we discuss the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration with a special focus on the recent findings regarding mitochondrial quality control pathways, beyond the classical effects of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bioenergetic alterations. We also discuss how disturbances in these processes underlie the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD and HD.

AB  - Nicotinamide, the amide form of vitamin B-3 (niacin), has long been associated with neuronal development, survival, and function in the central nervous system (CNS), being implicated in both neuronal death and neuroprotection. Here, we summarise a body of research investigating the role of nicotinamide in neuronal health within the CNS, with a focus on studies that have shown a neuroprotective effect. Nicotinamide appears to play a role in protecting neurons from traumatic injury, ischaemia, and stroke, as well as being implicated in 3 key neurodegenerative conditions: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. A key factor is the bioavailability of nicotinamide, with low concentrations leading to neurological deficits and dementia and high levels potentially causing neurotoxicity. Finally, nicotinamide's potential mechanisms of action are discussed, including the general maintenance of cellular energy levels and the more specific inhibition of molecules such as the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1).

AB  - Background: Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a non-invasive method of stimulating widespread cortical areas and, presumably, deeper neural networks. The current study assessed the effects of DTMS in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD) using a systematic review.
   Methods: Electronic literature search (PsycInfo, Medline until April 2017) identified k = 9 studies (k = 4 randomized-controlled trials, RCTs, with inactive sham and k = 5 open-label studies). DTMS was most commonly applied using high frequency/intensity (10-20 Hz/100-120% of the resting motor threshold, MT) protocols for 10-20 daily sessions in cases with alcohol, nicotine or cocaine use disorders. The outcome measures were craving and dependence (according to standardized scales) or consumption (frequency, abstinence or results of biological assays) at the end of the daily treatment phases and at the last follow-up.
   Results: Acute and longer-term (6-12 months) reductions in alcohol craving were observed after 20 sessions (20 Hz, 120% MT) relative to baseline in k = 4 open-label studies with comorbid SUD and major depressive disorder (MDD). In k = 2 RCTs without MDD, alcohol consumption acutely decreased after 10-12 sessions (10-20 Hz, 100-120% MT) relative to baseline or to sham. Alcohol craving was reduced only after higher frequency/intensity DTMS (20 Hz, 120% MT) relative to sham in k = 1 RCT. Nicotine consumption was reduced and abstinence was increased after 13 sessions (10 Hz, 120% MT) and at the 6-month follow-up relative to sham in k = 1 RCT. Cocaine craving was reduced after 12 sessions (15 Hz, 100% MT) and at the 2-month follow-up relative to baseline in k = 1 open-label study while consumption was reduced after 12 sessions (10 Hz, 100% MT) relative to baseline but not to sham in k = 1 RCT.
   Conclusions: High-frequency DTMS may be effective at treating some SUD both acutely and in the longer-term. Large RCTs with inactive sham are required to determine the efficacy and the optimal stimulation parameters of DTMS for the treatment of SUD.

AB  - Background: Mental health policy can be an essential and powerful tool to improve a population's mental health. However, around one third of countries do not possess a mental health policy, and there are large disparities in population coverage rates between high-and low-income countries. The goal of this study is to identify the transition and implementation challenges of mental health policies in both high-income countries (HICs) as well as middle-and low-income countries (MLICs).
   Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Campbell Library were searched from inception to 31 December 2017, for studies on implemented mental health policies at the national level. Abstracts and the main texts of papers were double screened, and extracted data were analysed through thematic synthesis.
   Results: A total of 93 papers were included in this study, covering 24 HICs, 28 MLICs and 5 regions. Studies on mental health policies, especially those of MLICs, kept increasing, but MLICs were still underrepresented in terms of publication quantity and study frequency. Based on the included studies, nine policy domains were summarized: service organizing, service provision, service quality, human resources, legislation and human rights, advocacy, administration, surveillance and research, and financing and budgeting. HICs incrementally enriched their policy content in all domains over centuries of development; following HICs' experience, mental health policies in MLICs have boomed since the 1990s and quickly extended to all domains. Implementation problems in HICs were mainly related to service organizing and service provision; for MLICs, more severe implementation problems converged on financing and budgeting, administration and human resources.
   Conclusions: Mental health policy developments in both HICs and MLICs present a process of diversification and enrichment. In terms of implementation, MLICs are faced with more and greater challenges than HICs, especially in funding, human resources and administration. Therefore, future efforts should not only be made on helping MLICs developing mental health policies, but also on promoting policy implementation under MLICs' local context.

AB  - Telomerase, a specialized ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex, maintains telomere length at the 3 0 end of chromosomes, and functions importantly in stem cells, cancer and aging. Telomerase exists in neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), at a high level in the developing and adult brains of humans and rodents. Increasing studies have demonstrated that telomerase in NSCs/NPCs plays important roles in cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, neuronal survival and neuritogenesis. In addition, recent works have shown that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) can protect newborn neurons from apoptosis and excitotoxicity. However, to date, the link between telomerase and diseases in the central nervous system (CNS) is not well reviewed. Here, we analyze the evidence and summarize the important roles of telomerase in the CNS. Understanding the roles of telomerase in the nervous system is not only important to gain further insight into the process of the neural cell life cycle but would also provide novel therapeutic applications in CNS diseases such as neurodegenerative condition, mood disorders, aging and other ailments.

This study aims to describe patterns of use of health services of international migrant children and differences to respective native populations.
   Methods: Electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science, references of identified publications, and websites of relevant international agencies were searched. We included observational studies published between 2006 and 2016 that reported use of formal health services by migrant children (0-18 years), including first and second generation migrants. Data on study characteristics, study theme, main outcome and study quality were extracted.
   Results: One hundred seven full texts were included in the review. Of the studies that reported comparable outcomes, half (50%) indicated less use of healthcare by migrants compared with non-migrants; 25% reported no difference, 18% reported greater use, and 7% did not report this outcome. There was variation by theme, so that the proportion of conclusions "less use" was most common in the categories "general access to care", "primary care" and "oral health", whereas in the use of emergency rooms or hospitalisations, the most common conclusion was "greater use".
   Conclusions: Migrant children appear to use different types of healthcare services less than native populations, with the exception of emergency and hospital services.

AB  - Background: Despite the importance of inclusive employment, described in Goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employment of persons with psychiatric disabilities in Africa is lower than among the general population.Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to explore evidence related to the barriers to and facilitators of employment of persons with psychiatric disabilities in Africa.Methods: A literature search was conducted using six relevant electronic databases of articles published between 1990 and 2017.Results: Eight studies were identified and analysed regarding barriers and facilitators of employment of persons with psychiatric disabilities. The dynamic adaptation of the bio-psycho-social model was used as an analytical framework. Identified barriers include ill health, (anticipated) psychiatric illness, social stigma and discrimination, negative attitudes among employers and the lack of social support and government welfare. Facilitators of employment include stability of mental illness, heightened self-esteem, a personal decision to work despite stigma, competitive and supported employment, reduction in social barriers/stigma and workplace accommodations.Conclusion: Employment of persons with psychiatric disabilities is essential, yet there is dearth of scientific evidence to identify contextual models that might be useful in African countries and other low-and middle countries (LMICs). This gap in information would benefit from further research to improve the employment rates of persons with psychiatric disabilities in Africa.

AB  - Neurotrophins have been implicated in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric diseases. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant and widely distributed neurotrophin in the brain. Its Val66Met polymorphism (refSNP Cluster Report: rs6265) is a common and functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting the activity-dependent release of BDNF. BDNF Val66Met transgenic mice have been generated, which may provide further insight into the functional impact of this polymorphism in the brain. Considering the important role of BDNF in brain function, more than 1,100 genetic studies have investigated this polymorphism in the past 15 years. Although these studies have reported some encouraging positive findings initially, most of the findings cannot be replicated in following studies. These inconsistencies in BDNF Val66Met genetic studies may be attributed to many factors such as age, sex, environmental factors, ethnicity, genetic model used for analysis, and gene-gene interaction, which are discussed in this review. We also discuss the results of recent studies that have reported the novel functions of this polymorphism. Because many BDNF polymorphisms and non-genetic factors have been implicated in the complex traits of neuropsychiatric diseases, the conventional genetic association-based method is limited to address these complex interactions. Future studies should apply data mining and machine learning techniques to determine the genetic role of BDNF in neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - Background: The paper reviews alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol-related social and health issues among 15-29-year old young people in Asian countries, and discusses strategies for preventing and controlling alcohol use and related harms.
   Methods: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science for reports, reviews and journal articles published in English between 1st Jan 1990 and 31st August 2016.
   Results: Forty-one reports, reviews and journal papers were identified and included in the final review. The current drinking levels and prevalence among young people are markedly different between eight included Asian countries, ranging from 4.2% in Malaysia to 49.3% in China. In a majority of the selected Asian countries, over 15% of total deaths among young men and 6% among young women aged 15-29 years are attributable to alcohol use. Alcohol use among young people is associated with a number of harms, including stress, family violence, injuries, suicide, and sexual and other risky behaviours. Alcohol policies, such as controlling sales, social supply and marketing, setting up/raising a legal drinking age, adding health warning labels on alcohol containers, and developing a surveillance system to monitor drinking pattern and risky drinking behaviour, could be potential means to reduce harmful use of alcohol and related harm among young people in Asia.
   Conclusions: The review reveals that drinking patterns and behaviours vary across eight selected Asian countries due to culture, policies and regional variations. The research evidence holds substantial policy implications for harm reduction on alcohol drinking among young people in Asian countries - especially for China, which has almost no alcohol control policies at present.

AB  - Providing food to wildlife during periods when natural food is limited results in aggregations that may facilitate disease transmission. This is exemplified in western Wyoming where institutional feeding over the past century has aimed to mitigate wildlife-livestock conflict and minimize winter mortality of elk (Cervus canadensis). Here we review research across 23 winter feedgrounds where the most studied disease is brucellosis, caused by the bacterium Brucella abortus. Traditional veterinary practices (vaccination, test-and-slaughter) have thus far been unable to control this disease in elk, which can spill over to cattle. Current disease-reduction efforts are being guided by ecological research on elk movement and density, reproduction, stress, co-infections and scavengers. Given the right tools, feedgrounds could provide opportunities for adaptive management of brucellosis through regular animal testing and population level manipulations. Our analyses of several such manipulations highlight the value of a research-management partnership guided by hypothesis testing, despite the constraints of the sociopolitical environment. However, brucellosis is now spreading in unfed elk herds, while other diseases (e.g. chronic wasting disease) are of increasing concern at feedgrounds. Therefore experimental closures of feedgrounds, reduced feeding and lower elk populations merit consideration.

AB  - While urban expansion increasingly encroaches on natural habitats, many wildlife species capitalize on anthropogenic food resources, which have the potential to both positively and negatively influence their responses to infection. Here we examine how food availability and key nutrients have been reported to shape innate and adaptive immunity in wildlife by drawing from field-based studies, as well as captive and food restriction studies with wildlife species. Examples of food provisioning and key nutrients enhancing immune function were seen across the three study type distinctions, as were cases of trace metals and pharmaceuticals impairing the immunity of wildlife species. More generally, food provisioning in field studies tended to increase innate and adaptive responses to certain immune challenges, whereas patterns were less clear in captive studies. Mild food restriction often enhanced, whereas severe food restriction frequently impaired immunity. However, to enable stronger conclusions we stress a need for further research, especially field studies, and highlight the importance of integrating nutritional manipulation, immune challenge, and functional outcomes. Despite current gaps in research on this topic, modern high throughput molecular approaches are increasingly feasible for wildlife studies and offer great opportunities to better understand human influences on wildlife health.

AB  - Background: People with severe mental disorders (SMDs) are associated with increased risk of infectious disease including human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other types of hepatitis viruses because of high-risk behaviors compared to the general population. The prevalence of HIV in people with SMDs is higher in females than in males. Unlike HIV, the prevalence of HBV and HCV is higher in males than in females. This study aimed to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and estimated gender difference in the risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD.
   Methods: Literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. Publications were screened according to predefined inclusion criteria. A qualitative and quantitative analysis was undertaken for this systematic review. Eighteen materials published from 1993 to 2017 were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Random-effect model was used to calculate weighted prevalence, odds ratio (OR), and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: 12,290 citations were identified and 18 articles including 11,175 participants were included. The results of our meta-analysis show that the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD was 7.59% (95% CI 4.82-11.75), 15.63% (95% CI 7.19-30.69), and 7.21% (95% CI 4.44-11.50), respectively. The prevalence of HIV was higher in women (8.25%) than men (7.04%), but the prevalence of HBV and HCV was higher in men than women (18.91% versus 12.02% and 9.16% versus 5.43% for HBV and HCV in men versus women, respectively). A meta-analysis of included studies demonstrated a significantly increased risk of HBV (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.17-2.53) and HCV (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.16-3.20) infections in men compared to women in people with SMD. However, no significant association was observed between gender and HIV. The funnel plot and Egger's regression tests provided no evidence of substantial publication bias in the prevalence and gender difference in association for HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD.
   Conclusions: In our review, the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV was high. The prevalence of HBV is significantly higher than HIV and HCV. There was a significantly increased risk of HBV and HCV infections in men compared to women. No significant association was observed between gender and HIV. People with SMDs warrant greater emphasis in efforts to identify and treat HIV, HBV and HCV.

AB  - The treatment of psychiatric diseases with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is becoming more of a reality as studies proliferate the indications and targets for therapies. Opinions on the initial failures of DBS trials for some psychiatric diseases point to a certain lack of finesse in using an Open Loop DBS (OLDBS) system in these dynamic, cyclical pathologies. OLDBS delivers monomorphic input into dysfunctional brain circuits with modulation of that input via human interface at discrete time points with no interim modulation or adaptation to the changing circuit dynamics. Closed Loop DBS (CLDBS) promises dynamic, intrinsic circuit modulation based on individual physiologic biomarkers of dysfunction. Discussed here are several psychiatric diseases which may be amenable to CLDBS paradigms as the neurophysiologic dysfunction is stochastic and not static. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has several peripheral and central physiologic and neurologic changes preceding stereotyped hyper-activation behavioral responses. Biomarkers for CLDBS potentially include skin conductance changes indicating changes in the sympathetic nervous system, changes in serum and central neurotransmitter concentrations, and limbic circuit activation. Chemical dependency and addiction have been demonstrated to be improved with both ablation and DBS of the Nucleus Accumbens and as a serendipitous side effect of movement disorder treatment. Potential peripheral biomarkers are similar to those proposed for PTSD with possible use of environmental and geolocation based cues, peripheral signs of physiologic arousal, and individual changes in central circuit patterns. Non-substance addiction disorders have also been serendipitously treated in patients with OLDBS for movement disorders. As more is learned about these behavioral addictions, DBS targets and effectors will be identified. Finally, discussed is the use of facial recognition software to modulate activation of inappropriate responses for psychiatric diseases in which misinterpretation of social cues feature prominently. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder, PTSD, and Schizophrenia-all of which have a common feature of dysfunctional interpretation of facial affective clues. Technological advances and improvements in circuit-based, individual-specific, real-time adaptable modulation, forecast functional neurosurgery treatments for heretofore treatment-resistant behavioral diseases.

AB  - Background: Every year, more than 800,000 people worldwide die by suicide. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of brief psychological interventions in addressing suicidal thoughts and behaviour in healthcare settings.
   Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsycINFO databases. A predefined search strategy was used. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts followed by full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. Backward and forward citation tracking of included papers was conducted. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials and the CASP tool for randomised controlled trials. The small number and heterogeneity of studies did not allow for meta-analysis to be conducted. A narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: Four controlled studies of brief psychological interventions were included, conducted in Switzerland, the U.S. and across low and middle-income countries. Three studies were conducted with adults and one with adolescents. All studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. All of the interventions were implemented with patients after attending emergency departments and involved 3412 participants. The main outcomes were suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, depression and hospitalization. The components of the interventions were early therapeutic engagement, information provision, safety planning and follow-up contact for at least 12 months. The interventions drew to, different degrees, on psychological theory and techniques. Two trials that measured suicidal ideation found no impact. Two studies showed fewer suicide attempts, one showed fewer suicides and one found an effect on depression.
   Conclusions: Although the evidence base is small, brief psychological interventions appear to be effective in reducing suicide and suicide attempts. All studies to date have been conducted with people who had attended the ED but the interventions could potentially be adopted for inpatient and other outpatient settings. Early engagement and therapeutic intervention based on psychological theories of suicidal behaviour, sustained in follow-up contacts, may be particularly beneficial.

AB  - Introduction: An increase in post abortion care (PAC) research with adolescents, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, has brought to attention several associated research ethics challenges. In order to better understand the ethics context of PAC research with adolescents, we conducted a scoping review of published literature.
   Methods: Following a systematic search of PubMed, HINARI, and Google Scholar, we analysed articles meeting inclusion criteria to determine common themes across both the ethical challenges related to PAC research with adolescents and any available guidance on the identified challenges.
   Results: The literature search identified an initial 3321 records of which 14 were included in analysis following screening. Several ethical challenges stem from abortion being a controversial, sensitive, and stigmatized topic in many settings. Ethical dilemmas experienced by researchers conducting adolescent PAC research included: difficulties in convincing local health providers to permit PAC research; challenges in recruiting and seeking consent due to sensitivity of the subject; effectively protecting confidentiality; managing negative effects of interventions; creating a non-prejudicial atmosphere for research; managing emotional issues among adolescents; and dealing with uncertainty regarding the role of researchers when observing unethical health care practices. Suggested strategies for addressing some of these challenges include: using several sources to recruit study participants, using research to facilitate dialogue on abortion, briefing health workers on any observed unethical practices after data collection, fostering a comprehensive understanding of contextual norms and values, selecting staff with experience working with study populations, and avoiding collection of personal identifiers.
   Conclusion: Addressing ethical challenges that researchers face when conducting PAC research with adolescents requires guidance at the individual, institutional, community, and international levels. Overall, despite the documentation of challenges in the published literature, guidance on handling several of these ethics challenges is sparse. We encourage further research to clarify the identified challenges and support the development of formal guidance in this area.

AB  - The neurobiology of psychiatric disorders is still unclear, although changes in multiple neuronal systems, specifically the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic systems as well as abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and neural connectivity, are currently suggested to underlie their pathophysiology. A growing body of evidence suggests multifaceted mitochondrial dysfunction in mental disorders, which is in line with their role in neuronal activity, growth, development, and plasticity. In this review, we describe the main endeavors toward development of treatments that will enhance mitochondrial function and their transition into clinical use in congenital mitochondrial diseases and chronic disorders such as types 1 and 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. In addition, we discuss the relevance of mitochondrial targeted treatments to mental disorders and their potential to become a novel therapeutic strategy that will improve the efficiency of the current treatments.

AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) opens new perspectives in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), because of its ability to modulate cortical excitability and induce long-lasting effects. The aim of this review is to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding tDCS application in MDD. Methods: In this review, we searched for articles published in PubMed/MEDLINE from the earliest available date to February 2018 that explored clinical and cognitive effects of tDCS in MDD. Results: Despite differences in design and stimulation parameters, the examined studies indicated beneficial effects of tDCS for MDD. These preliminary results, the non-invasiveness of tDCS, and its good tolerability support the need for further research on this technique. Conclusions: tDCS constitutes a promising therapeutic alternative for patients with MDD, but its place in the therapeutic armamentarium remains to be determined.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances, in particular insomnia, represent a common problem in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs). Currently, there are no approved medications for insomnia in children by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency and therefore they are prescribed off-label. We critically reviewed pediatric literature on drugs as well as nonpharmacological (behavioral) interventions used for sleep disturbances in children with NDDs. Methods: PubMed, Ovid (including PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE (R), and Embase), and Web of Knowledge databases were searched through February 12, 2017, with no language restrictions. Two authors independently and blindly performed the screening. Results: Good sleep practices and behavioral interventions, supported by moderate-to-low level evidence, are the first recommended treatments for pediatric insomnia but they are often challenging to implement. Antihistamine agents, such as hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine, are the most widely prescribed sedatives in the pediatric practice but evidence supporting their use is still limited. An increasing body of evidence supports melatonin as the safest choice for children with NDDs. Benzodiazepines are not recommended in children and should only be used for transient insomnia, especially if daytime anxiety is present. Only few studies have been carried out in children's and adolescents' zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone, with contrasting results. Limited evidence supports the use of alpha-agonists such as clonidine to improve sleep onset latency, especially in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder subjects. Tricyclic antidepressants, used in adults with insomnia, are not recommended in children because of their safety profile. Trazodone and mirtazapine hold promise but require further studies. Conclusions: Here, we provided a tentative guide for the use of drugs for insomnia in children with NDDs. Well-controlled studies employing both objective polysomnography and subjective sleep measures are needed to determine the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the currently prescribed pediatric sleep medicines in children with NDDs.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been regarded as the third gaseous transmitter alongside nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). In mammalian brain, H2S is produced redundantly by four enzymatic pathways, implying its abundance in the organ. In physiological conditions, H2S has been found to induce the formation of long-term potential in neuronal cells by augmenting the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Likewise, it also actively takes part in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ and pH homeostasis in both neuronal cells and glia cells. Intriguingly, emerging evidence indicates a connection of H2S with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, the endogenous H2S level in the substantia nigra (SN) is significantly reduced along with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment in rats, while supplementation of H2S not only reverses 6-OHDA-induced neuronal loss but also attenuates the following disorders of movement, suggesting a protective effect of H2S in Parkinson's disease (PD). Remarkably, the protective effect has been extensively demonstrated with various in vitro and in vivo PD models. These suggest that H2S may be a new hope for the treatment of PD. Further studies have shown that the protective effects can be ascribed to H2S-mediated anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and pro-survival activity, which are also summarized in the review. Moreover, the progresses on the development of H2S donors are also conveyed with an emphasis on the treatment of PD. Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that the precise role of H2S in the pathogenesis of PD remains largely elusive. Therefore, more studies are warranted before turning the hope into a real therapy for PD.

AB  - Self-harm among young people remains largely stigmatised and misunderstood. Parents have been identified as key facilitators in the help-seeking process, yet they typically report feeling ill-equipped to support the young person in their care. The aim of this review was to examine the perspectives of both young people (aged 12-28) and parents and to develop the conceptual framework for a future qualitative study. A systematic search of MEDLINE and PsycINFO was performed to identify articles that focused on the experiences of family members and young people related to managing the discovery of self-harm. Fourteen articles were included for review. Four addressed the perspectives of young people and 10 reported on the impact of adolescent self-harm on parents. The impact of self-harm is substantial and there exists a discrepancy between the most common parental responses and the preferences of young people. In addition, parents are often reluctant to seek help for themselves due to feelings of shame and guilt. This highlights the need for accessible resources that seek to alleviate parents' distress, influence the strategies implemented to manage the young person's self-harm behaviour, reduce self-blame of family members, and increase the likelihood of parental help seeking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Catatonia in medically ill patients is rare but often unrecognized. This monograph summarizes current knowledge on the diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, and management of catatonia occurring in the medical setting.
   METHODS: PubMed searches were used to identify relevant articles from 1962 to present.
   RESULTS: More than 3,000 articles were obtained and reviewed for relevance, including references of articles identified by the initial search. Several areas were identified as important, including: (1) catatonia and delirium; (2) malignant catatonia; (3) pediatric catatonia; (4) catatonia associated with another medical condition (CAMC); (5) drug exposure and withdrawal syndromes associated with catatonia; and (6) treatment of catatonia in the medical setting.
   CONCLUSIONS: Catatonia in the medically ill appears to have numerous etiologies, although etiology does not seem to modify the general treatment approach of prompt administration of lorazepam. Delirium and catatonia are commonly comorbid in the medical setting and should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. Electroconvulsive therapy should be offered to patients who do not respond to benzodiazepines or have malignant features. Removing offending agents and treating the underlying medical condition is paramount when treating CAMC. Memantine or amantadine may be helpful adjunctive agents. There is not enough evidence to support the use of antipsychotics or stimulants in treating CAMC.

AB  - Objective: Acute course of electroconvulsive therapy is effective in inducing remission from depression, but recurrence rate is unacceptably high following termination of electroconvulsive therapy despite continued pharmacotherapy. Continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy have been studied for their efficacy in preventing relapse and recurrence of depression. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy in preventing relapse and recurrence of depression in comparison to antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane register of controlled trials from the database inception to December 2016 without restriction on language or publication status for randomized trials of continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy. Two independent Cochrane reviewers extracted the data in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed using four domains of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. Outcomes were pooled using random effect model. The primary outcome was relapse or recurrence of depression.
   Results: Five studies involving 436 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of the pooled data showed that continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy, both with pharmacotherapy, were associated with significantly fewer relapses and recurrences than pharmacotherapy alone at 6months and 1year after a successful acute course of electroconvulsive therapy (risk ratio=0.64, 95% confidence interval=[0.41, 0.98], p=0.04, risk ratio=0.46, 95% confidence interval=[0.21, 0.98], p=0.05, respectively). There was insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis of stand-alone continuation electroconvulsive therapy or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy beyond 1year.
   Conclusion: There are only a few randomized trials of continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy. The preliminary and limited evidence suggests the modest efficacy of continuation electroconvulsive therapy and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy with concomitant pharmacotherapy in preventing relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes for 1year after the remission of index episode with the acute course of electroconvulsive therapy.

AB  - The authors undertook a scoping review to assess the literature from 2002 to 2017 on the relationship between occupation and female breast cancer. Case-control, cohort, and meta-analytic studies suggest that women working as flight attendants, in medical professions, some production positions, sales and retail, and scientific technical staff are likely to have elevated risk of breast cancer. In addition, occupational exposures to night-shift work, ionizing radiation, some chemicals, job stress, and sedentary work may increase risk of breast cancer. Occupational physical activity appears to decrease risk. Workplace exposures to passive smoke and occupational exposure to nonionizing radiation do not appear to affect breast cancer risk. Some studies of occupational categories and workplace exposures indicate that risk may be modified by duration of exposure, timing of exposure, dose, hormone-receptor subtypes, and menopausal status at diagnosis. The compelling data from this review reveal a substantial need for further research on occupation and breast cancer.

AB  - Diet and immunity are both highly complex processes through which organisms interact with their environment and adapt to variable conditions. Parents that are able to transmit information to their offspring about prevailing environmental conditions have a selective advantage by 'priming' the physiology of their offspring. We used a meta-analytic approach to test the effect of parental diet on offspring immune responses. Using the geometric framework for nutrition (a method for analysing diet compositions wherein food nutrient components are expressed as axes in a Cartesian coordinate space) to define dietary manipulations in terms of their energy and macronutrient compositions, we compiled the results of 226 experiments from 38 published papers on the intergenerational effects of diet on immunity, across a range of study species and immunological responses. We observed intergenerational impacts of parental nutrition on a number of offspring immunological processes, including expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well as decreases in anti-inflammatory markers in response to certain parental diets. For example, across our data set as a whole (encompassing several types of dietary manipulation), dietary stress in parents was seen to significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine levels measured in offspring (overall d = 0.575). All studies included in our analysis were from experiments in which the offspring were raised on a normal or control diet, so our findings suggest that a nutrition-dependent immune state can be inherited, and that this immune state is maintained in the short term, despite offspring returning to an 'optimal' diet. We demonstrate how the geometric framework for nutrition can be used to disentangle the role that different forms of dietary manipulation can have on intergenerational immunity. For example, offspring B-cell responses were significantly decreased when parents were raised on a range of different diets. Similarly, our approach allowed us to show that a parental diet elevated in protein (regardless of energy composition and relative to a control diet) can increase expression of inflammatory markers while decreasing B-cell-associated markers. By conducting a systematic review of the literature, we have identified important gaps that impair our understanding of the intergenerational effects of diet, such as a paucity of experimental studies involving increased protein and decreased energy, and a lack of studies directed at the whole-organism consequences of these processes, such as immune resilience to infection. The results of our analyses inform our understanding of the effects of diet on physiological state across diverse biological fields, including biomedical sciences, maintenance of agricultural breed stock and conservation breeding programs, among others.

AB  - Nutrient criteria provide a scientific foundation for the comprehensive evaluation, prevention, control and management of water eutrophication. In this review, the literature was examined to systematically evaluate the benefits, drawbacks, and applications of statistical analysis, paleolimnological reconstruction, stressor-response model, and model inference approaches for nutrient criteria determination. The developments and challenges in the determination of nutrient criteria in lakes and reservoirs are presented. Reference lakes can reflect the original states of lakes, but reference sites are often unavailable. Using the paleolimnological reconstruction method, it is often difficult to reconstruct the historical nutrient conditions of shallow lakes in which the sediments are easily disturbed. The model inference approach requires sufficient data to identify the appropriate equations and characterize a waterbody or group of waterbodies, thereby increasing the difficulty of establishing nutrient criteria. The stressor-response model is a potential development direction for nutrient criteria determination, and the mechanisms of stressor-response models should be studied further. Based on studies of the relationships among water ecological criteria, eutrophication, nutrient criteria and plankton, methods for determining nutrient criteria should be closely integrated with water management requirements.

AB  - Recent research has expanded the list of factors that control spatial attention. Beside current goals and perceptual salience, statistical learning, reward, motivation and emotion also affect attention. But do these various factors influence spatial attention in the same manner, as suggested by the integrated framework of attention, or do they target different aspects of spatial attention? Here I present evidence that the control of attention may be implemented in two ways. Whereas current goals typically modulate where in space attention is prioritized, search habits affect how one moves attention in space. Using the location probability learning paradigm, I show that a search habit forms when people frequently find a visual search target in one region of space. Attentional cuing by probability learning differs from that by current goals. Probability cuing is implicit and persists long after the probability cue is no longer valid. Whereas explicit goal-driven attention codes space in an environment-centered reference frame, probability cuing is viewer-centered and is insensitive to secondary working memory load and aging. I propose a multi-level framework that separates the source of attentional control from its implementation. Similar to the integrated framework, the multi-level framework considers current goals, perceptual salience, and selection history as major sources of attentional control. However, these factors are implemented in two ways, controlling where spatial attention is allocated and how one shifts attention in space. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticides are a mixture of chemical substances used to kill pests. Apart from their toxicity to pests, thy affect nontarget organisms. They also generate free radicals producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can disturb cellular pathways by inhibiting various enzymes or receptors. Pesticides also induce oxidative DNA damage, DNA adducts, and single or double strand DNA breaks. Various mechanisms of DNA repair deal with such damages and help to maintain cell integrity. Alteration in DNA repair genes modulates the individual's susceptibility towards DNA repair and various diseases. Biological monitoring provides a useful tool for the estimation of genetic risk in populations exposed to pesticides. Large numbers of evidences show that occupational exposure to pesticides in agricultural workers has been associated with an increased incidence of various diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, reproductive disorders, and birth defects. In this review, we have discussed occupational pesticide exposure, various mechanisms of DNA damage caused by pesticides, DNA repair mechanisms, biomonitoring tools, and various diseases caused by pesticide exposure.

AB  - Objective Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique increasingly used to relieve symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Electrophysiologic markers, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP), have high temporal resolution sensitive to detect plastic changes of the brain associated with symptomatic improvement following tDCS application.
   Methods We performed systematic review to identify electrophysiological markers that reflect tDCS effects on plastic brain changes in psychiatric disorders. A total of 638 studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, psychINFPO. Of these, 21 full-text articles were assessed eligible and included in the review.
   Results Although the reviewed studies were heterogeneous in their choices of tDCS protocols, targeted electrophysiological markers, and disease entities, their results strongly support EEG/ERPs to sensitively reflect plastic brain changes and the associated symptomatic improvement following tDCS.
   Conclusion EEG/ERPs may serve a potent tool in revealing the mechanisms underlying psychiatric symptoms, as well as in localizing the brain area targeted for stimulation. Future studies in each disease entities employing consistent tDCS protocols and electrophysiological markers would be necessary in order to substantiate and further elaborate the findings of studies included in the present systematic review.

AB  - Background: Exposure to parental suicide attempt is associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes like lower educational performance, drug abuse and delinquent behavior. When a patient is hospitalized after a suicide attempt, this presents a unique opportunity to identify whether the patient has children, and thereby provide adequate follow-up for both the parent/patient and their children. The objective of this paper was to review the existing literature on follow-up measures for children subjected to parental suicide attempt. Methods: In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we conducted a systematic literature search. Results: The search resulted in a total of 1275 article titles, of which all abstracts were screened. Out of these, 72 full text papers were read, and a final four articles were included. Three of the included papers described parts of the same study from an emergency department in The Hague, where a protocol was implemented for monitoring and referring children of parents attempting suicide. The fourth article described the association between maternal attempted suicide and risk of abuse or neglect of their children. Conclusions: The lack of research in this particular area is striking. The circumstances surrounding a parent's suicide attempt call for appropriate familial care.

AB  - Several studies suggest that work-related stress in police officers may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of studies is, however, still lacking.
   According to PRISMA statement, a systematic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Cinahl and PsychInfo electronic databases was undertaken. Studies published in English between 1/1/2000 and 31/12/2016 were included. A studies quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale (NOS).
   The preliminary search retrieved 752 records. After selection, 16 studies (total population 17,698) were retrieved. The average quality of studies was low. Exposure to stress in cross-sectional studies was inconstantly associated with hypertension, obesity, dyslipidaemia, and impaired glucose metabolism. In addition, there was a prevalence of positive studies showing an association between stress and cardiovascular disease morbidity. Studies of higher quality, such as longitudinal studies on large sample size, were more supportive of a significant positive association between stress and cardiovascular risk factors. Results were, however, often conflicting and inconsistent with regard to definitions and measurement of stress, features of individual study design, study conduct, and conclusions drawn.
   A sound precautionary principle would be to adopt worksite health promotion programs designed to implement stress management strategies in this category of workers.

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests first episode psychosis (FEP) is associated with suicide, and the influence of depression on suicidal behaviour in cross sectional studies is clear. However the influence of depression during FEP on longer-term mortality is not certain. Existing evidence was synthesised to understand the influence of depressive symptoms during FEP on subsequent suicidal behaviour.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and NICE Evidence were searched from inception to Jan 25, 2017. Longitudinal observational studies assessing the relationship between depressive symptoms during FEP with a measure of s at a specified follow-up time were included. Summary estimates were extracted. The Downs and Black Instrument was used to appraise study quality. Odds ratio (OR) of suicidal behaviour were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017055881).
   Results: Of 4210 articles found, 23 fulfilled eligibility criteria. 13 were included in meta-analysis (n = 3002). 428 participants demonstrated suicidal behaviour in the study periods. Odds of suicidal behaviour during follow-up were significantly higher among patients with depressive symptoms during FEP compared to those without (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.14-2.21; I2 = 50.0%, p = 0.02). Meta-regression demonstrated no evidence of influence of length of follow-up on results.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms during FEP are associated with increased longer-term risk of suicidal behaviour. This association should be acknowledged during early management planning. Large-scale clinical trials are needed to identify efficacious management of depression during FEP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patient satisfaction with mental health care has become an important construct in research and routine care. Both as a process measure and as an outcome criterion in its own right, it needs to be assessed with appropriate scales.
   Purpose: To provide a review of scales for assessing patient satisfaction in different settings, their characteristics and the content of care that they cover.
   Method: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify studies that used a scale to assess patient satisfaction with care in mental health services. Peer reviewed articles were screened by two independent reviewers and included when they met predetermined criteria. Data on the characteristics of scales found in at least two studies were extracted and a qualitative analysis was performed to identify the contents of included scales.
   Results: Twenty-eight scales were identified. They vary substantially in terms of structure, length, focus and quality. The qualitative analyses identified a total of 19 contents of care that were covered in the scales. The most consistent contents across scales were overall satisfaction, followed by relationship with staff and staff skills.
   Discussion: A wide range of scales have been used to assess patient satisfaction with mental health care in different settings. Whilst some scales have been frequently used, there is no consensus on a gold standard one. The choice of the most appropriate scale depends on the aim of the assessment, the setting, the content that

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is a protein that regulates metabolism and inflammation by activating nuclear receptors, especially the family of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs). PGC-1 alpha and PPARs also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular energy production, thermogenesis, and lipid metabolism. Brain energy metabolism may also be regulated in part by the interaction between PGC-1 alpha and PPARs. Because neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and bipolar disorder have been associated with dysregulated mitochondrial and brain energy metabolism, PGC-1 alpha may represent a potential drug target for these conditions. The purpose of this article is to review the physiology of PGC-1 alpha, PPARs, and the role of PPAR agonists to target PGC-1 alpha to treat neurodegenerative diseases and bipolar disorder. We also review clinical trials of repurposed antidiabetic thiazolidines and anti-triglyceride fibrates (PPAR agonists) for neurodegenerative diseases and bipolar disorder. PGC-1 alpha and PPARs are innovative potential targets for bipolar disorder and warrant future clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Individuals with mental health problems have many support needs that are often inadequately met; however, perceptions of who should be responsible for meeting these needs have been largely unexplored. Varying perceptions may influence whether, how, and to what extent relevant stakeholders support individuals with mental health problems.
   Aims: To critically evaluate the literature to determine who different stakeholders believe should be responsible for supporting individuals with mental health problems, what factors shape these perceptions, and how they relate to one another.
   Method: A critical literature review was undertaken. Following an extensive literature search, the conceptual contributions of relevant works were critically evaluated. A concept map was created to build a conceptual framework of the topic.
   Results: Views of individual versus societal responsibility for need provision and health; the morality of caring; and attributions of responsibility for mental illness offered valuable understandings of the review questions. Creating a concept map revealed that various interrelated factors may influence perceptions of responsibility.
   Conclusions: Varying perceptions of who should be responsible for supporting individuals with mental health problems may contribute to unmet support needs among this group. Our critical review helps build a much-needed conceptual framework of factors influencing perceptions of responsibility. Such a framework is essential as these views iteratively shape and reflect the complex divisions of mental healthcare roles and responsibilities. Understanding these perceptions can help define relevant stakeholders' roles more clearly, which can improve mental health services and strengthen stakeholder accountability.

AB  - Patients with mental disorders have a higher coronary morbidity and mortality as compared to the general population. However, it remains unclear whether their coronary risk scores are higher than those of the general population. We reviewed studies and meta-analyze case-control studies about coronary risk scores in individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders. Search was performed in Pubmed and clinical trial registration databases. Four case-control studies were identified, comprising 963 individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders and 1681 controls. They focused on the most validated coronary risk score, the Framingham Risk Score 1998 (FRS 1998). The mean FRS 1998 was significantly higher in individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders than in the general population 7.9(+/- 6.9) vs. 5.0(+/- 4.8). FRS 1998 differs between individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders and controls (Mean difference:1.84 [95% CI:0.57-3.11], p = 0.0051; high heterogeneity was observed (I-2 = 78%; p < 0.003). The difference was driven by three FRS 1998 criteria: smoking, diabetes and HDL cholesterolemia. The mean FRS 1998 was significantly higher in men, and to a trend in women. In conclusion, individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders have a higher coronary risk score than controls. The FRS 1998 should be used as a simple and objective way of monitoring coronary risk in order to improve prevention of coronary events in psychiatric settings.

AB  - Conceptualization and assessment of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has evolved substantially in recent years. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, NSSI and its related variables have traditionally been assessed retrospectively, leading to less precise studies of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance, cessation, or aggravation of this behavior. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) enables real-time collection of patient states, which can be very useful in the study of the mechanisms implied in this behavior. This systematic review aims to elucidate the current status of EMA use in NSSI investigation. An exhaustive search in PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted up to September 2017. All papers included were focused on the study of NSSI using EMA. Studies with methodological diversity were included, which were afterwards organized according to main topic of studies. There were no ineligibility criteria based on age or diagnosis. Twenty-three papers were studied, the majority of which are short-term studies focused on the study of affect dynamics and the emotion-regulation function of NSSI. Implications of these results and recommendations for future research are discussed.

In addition to these core characteristics other movement disorders (e.g. dystonia, myoclonus, spasticity), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, cognitive dysfunction) may occur in the course of the disease and can severely impair patients' quality of live. To date no causal therapy is available and therefore symptomatic treatment plays a pivotal role in patient care. In this article we provide an overview of frequent clinical symptoms and their symptomatic treatment options.

AB  - Purpose of reviewHallucinations are common and often stressful experiences, occurring in all sensory modalities. They frequently complicate many disorders or situations, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, hearing or vision loss, intoxications and delirium. Although psychoeducation, coping techniques and psychotherapy may be broadly applicable, they do not address a specific underlying brain mechanism. Pharmacotherapy may effectively alleviate hallucinations if the corresponding mechanism is present, whereas in its absence, may only cause harmful side effects. Therefore, pharmacotherapy needs input about underlying brain mechanisms.Recent findingsRecent findings suggest new underlying neurobiological mechanisms as possible therapeutic targets in selected patients, for example increased glutamate levels. In addition, neuronavigation can guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations to target-specific cortical regions.SummaryWe propose the use of neuroimaging methods to better understand the interaction of different mechanisms underlying hallucinations and to use this knowledge to guide pharmacotherapy or focal brain stimulation in a personalized manner. In addition, we suggest evidence from various imaging modalities should converge to answer a research question. We believe this convergence of evidence' avoids the problem of overreliance on single and isolated findings.

AB  - Over the last decade a prominent amount of studies in preclinical transgenic models of multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been performed. These studies have helped understand mechanisms downstream to the a-synuclein oligodendroglial accumulation relevant to human MSA. However, the successful translation of the preclinical outcomes into a clinical trial has failed. Looking back, we can now identify possible confounders for the failure. Biomarkers of disease progression are mostly missing. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapeutic clinical trials is limited. The need of both proof-of-concept as well as clinically relevant preclinical study designs with clinically relevant timing and preclinical readouts is identified as a must in our translational efforts for MSA to date. Finally, improved clinical study designs with improved enrollment criteria, and measurement outcomes are warranted on the way to finding the successful therapeutic approach for MSA. This review provides an overview of experimental studies and clinical trials for MSA and the lessons learned over the last decade towards the identification of the cure for MSA.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe contribution of people with psychosis to homicide statistics is small, but there is a statistically significantly higher rate of homicide among them than in the general population. Legal authorities and the wider public call for more information. Our aim was a narrative synthesis of empirical literature generated by systematic searches for the five complete years 2013-2017.Recent findingsOne article showed that people with psychosis are five times more likely to be homicide victims than those without, but focus remains on perpetrators. Consensus is that although psychotic symptoms contribute to homicidal acts, so do many of the variables that increase homicide risk more generally - including substance use, trauma histories and access to weapons; thus, both the epidemiology of homicide and some details, like method, may be country specific. In 2013-2017, variation in service provision as a risk factor for homicide has emerged more clearly but, overall, research made few homicide-specific advances.SummaryCriminal homicide is, fortunately, uncommon in most countries. Homicides by people with psychosis are so rare that they do not rate mention in the 2013 United Nations Global Survey of Homicide. This may account for the limitations to much research for this group. Despite some homicide-specific evidence of advantage for early intervention for psychosis, impact of improving treatment - the most promising way forward - will generally have to be inferred from the not entirely satisfactory surrogate of effects of treatment on violent offending more generally.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the accuracy of screening tools in detecting postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, Clinical Key, and Google Scholar from the years 2001-2016 with a modified PRISMA method. The keywords, "postnatal depression screening," "antenatal depression screening," and "maternal depression" were used in the search. Sixty-eight articles were reviewed, and 36 further analyzed. Results: The accuracy of screening tools was dependent upon a number of factors. The studies reviewed differed in the types of screening tools tested, the combination of screening tools administered, the timing in which screening tools were administered, the geographic location of patients screened, and the reference standard(s) used. Conclusions: No tool could be deemed best at accurately detecting PPD on the basis of sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, there was no recommended time duration in which screening should be done. Thus, further research is needed to elucidate the accuracy of PPD screening tools, and the best criteria to determine this.

AB  - Patients describe experiencing personal recovery despite ongoing symptoms of psychosis. The aim of the current research was to perform a meta-analysis investigating the relationship between clinical and personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. A comprehensive OvidSP database search was performed to identify relevant studies. Correlation coefficients of the relationship between clinical and personal recovery were retrieved from primary studies. Meta-analyses were performed, calculating mean weighted effect sizes for the association between clinical and personal recovery, hope, and empowerment. Additionally, associations between positive, negative, affective symptoms, general functioning, and personal recovery were investigated. The results show that heterogeneity across studies was substantial. Random effect meta-analysis of the relationship between symptom severity and personal recovery revealed a mean weighted correlation coefficient of r = -.21 (95% CI = -0.27 to -0.14, P < .001). We found the following mean weighted effect size for positive symptoms r = -.20 (95% CI = -0.27 to -0.12, P < .001), negative symptoms r = -.24 (95% CI = -0.33 to -0.15, P < .001), affective symptoms r = -.34 (95% CI = -0.44 to -0.24, P < .001) and functioning r = .21 (95% CI = -0.09 to 0.32, P < .001). The results indicate a significant small to medium association between clinical and personal recovery. Psychotic symptoms show a smaller correlation than affective symptoms with personal recovery. These findings suggest that clinical and personal recovery should both be considered in treatment and outcome monitoring of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

AB  - Background. Clinical practice of mental health services changed in 1978 after the Basaglia Law was passed, and it is now characterized by usually voluntary treatments offered by community-based services. That broadened the interventions' focus from the single subject to their environment. Dual diagnosis is defined by WHO as "the co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive substance use disorder and another psychiatric disorder". It is considered to be a "border territory" since entails networking between different medical services. Materials and methods. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Search terms were: "guidelines", "treatment", "comorbidity", "substance abuse", "alcohol", "dual-diagnosis", "psychiatric illness", "outpatient", "inpatient", "health care service", "clinical practice". National and regional regulations about health and addiction were screened too. Out of 598 titles, 31 studies were included in this article for their relevance on treatments and networking between services for dual diagnosis cases. Results. There are not any guidelines for clinical practice in the literature, neither there are any shared treatment strategies on a national level. Considering the autonomy that every regional health service has, several different courses of action are possible. Here there are reported the ones available. Conclusions. After discussing the weak points of the treatment options, we suggest the "Multidisciplinary Healthcare" model to best address the difficulties represented by dual diagnosis cases.

AB  - Question Oppositional defiant and conduct disorders (ODD and CD) start early and persist, incurring high individual and collective costs. To inform policy and practice, we therefore asked: What is the best available research evidence on preventing and treating these disorders?
   Study selection and analysis We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions addressing the prevention or treatment of behaviour problems in individuals aged 18 years or younger. Our criteria were tailored to identify higher-quality RCTs that were also relevant to policy and practice. We searched the CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases, updating our initial searches in May 2017. Thirty-seven RCTs met inclusion criteriaevaluating 15 prevention programmes, 8 psychosocial treatments and 5 medications. We then conducted narrative synthesis.
   Findings For prevention, 3 notable programmes reduced behavioural diagnoses: Classroom-Centered Intervention; Good Behavior Game; and Fast Track. Five other programmes reduced serious behaviour symptoms such as criminal activity. Prevention benefits were long term, up to 35 years. For psychosocial treatment, Incredible Years reduced behavioural diagnoses. Three other interventions reduced criminal activity. Psychosocial treatment benefits lasted from 1 to 8years. While 4 medications reduced post-test symptoms, all caused important adverse events.
   Conclusions Considerable RCT evidence favours prevention.
   Clinical implications Effective prevention programmes should therefore be made widely available. Effective psychosocial treatments should also be provided for all children with ODD/CD. But medications should be a last resort given associated adverse events and given only short-term evidence of benefits. Policymakers and practitioners can help children and populations by acting on these findings.

AB  - The role of phagocytosis in the neuroprotective function of microglia has been appreciated for a long time, but only more recently a dysregulation of this process has been recognized in Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, microglia play several critical roles in central nervous system (CNS), such as clearance of dying neurons and pathogens as well as immunomodulation, and to fulfill these complex tasks they engage distinct phenotypes. Regulation of phenotypic plasticity and phagocytosis in microglia can be impaired by defects in molecular machinery regulating critical homeostatic mechanisms, including autophagy. Here, we briefly summarize current knowledge on molecular mechanisms of microglia phagocytosis, and the neuro-pathological role of microglia in PD. Then we focus more in detail on the possible functional role of microglial phagocytosis in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Evidence in support of either a beneficial or deleterious role of phagocytosis in dopaminergic degeneration is reported. Altered expression of target-recognizing receptors and lysosomal receptor CD68, as well as the emerging determinant role of alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) in phagocytic function is discussed. We finally discuss the rationale to consider phagocytic processes as a therapeutic target to prevent or slow down dopaminergic degeneration.

AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between substance use and suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) has important public health implications for suicide prevention in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 75% of suicides occur. This systematic review explored the associations between substance use and SIB in LMICs.
   Methods: We searched five databases using a combination of keywords for substance use, SIB and LMICs to identify English-written quantitative studies published between January 2006 and February 2016. Data were extracted to provide an overview of what is known about the topic, highlight gaps in the literature, and explore the implications of current knowledge for suicide prevention. Studies included in the review were assessed for methodological quality using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist.
   Results: Analysis of included studies (N = 108) demonstrated a consistent positive association between substance use and SIB across all substances (i.e. alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, illicit drugs, non-medical use of prescription drugs), all substance use dimensions (i.e. intoxication, use, and pathological use) and all SIB dimensions (i.e. suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behaviour, and suicide). Most of the available research evidence comes from upper-middle-income countries, only 22% comes from lower-middle-income and low-income countries. Most studies focused on alcohol and tobacco, while neglecting substances such as cannabis, opioids, sedatives, stimulants, misuse of prescription medication, inhalants, and hallucinogens. Most of the studies employed a cross-sectional design, were conducted within a risk-factor paradigm, and provided little information about the potential interaction between variables.
   Conclusions: Public health suicide prevention policy and research in LMICs should take account of the fact that: substance use is a potentially modifiable risk factor; assessment and management of substance use is integral to the care of at-risk patients; reducing consumption and hazardous use of substances in LMICs is important for suicide prevention; and research needs to be expanded to include more theory driven research that focuses on all substance use dimensions and SIB dimensions, while employing more sophisticated statistical methods.

AB  - Positron emission tomography has, for 30 years, been used in numerous case-control studies searching for hypothesized differences in the density of neuroreceptor or transporter proteins in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. In most cases, the results have not been conclusive. One reason could be the sizeable interindividual variability in biochemical markers, which in twin studies have shown to emanate from both environmental and genetic factors, leading to low statistical power for the detection of group effects. On the other hand, the same interindividual variability has served as an opportunity for correlative studies on the biological underpinning of behaviour. Using this approach, a series of studies has linked markers for the dopamine and serotonin system to personality traits associated with psychiatric conditions. Based on increasing evidence for the view that many psychopathological states represent extremes of a continuum rather than distinct categories, this research strategy may lead to new biological insights about the vulnerability to and pathophysiology ofmajor psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: Alexithymia and emotional awareness may be considered overlapping constructs and both have been shown to be related to psychological and emotional well-being. However, it is not clear how the constructs relate to each other empirically or if they may overlap more or less in different populations. The aim of this review was therefore to conduct a meta-analysis of correlations between the most commonly used measures of alexithymia (i.e., the self-report instrument Toronto Alexithymia Scale; TAS-20) and emotional awareness (i.e., the observer-rated instrument Level of Emotional Awareness Scale; LEAS) and to explore potential moderators of their relationship.
   Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies published until the end of February 2018. Study samples were coded as medical conditions, psychiatric disorders and/or healthy controls and sample mean age and gender distribution were extracted. Correlations between the TAS-20 and the LEAS were subjected to a random effect of meta-analysis and moderators were explored in subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Publication bias was considered.
   Results: 21 studies reporting on 28 independent samples on correlation analysis were included, encompassing a total of 2857 subjects (57% women). The aggregated correlation between TAS-20 and LEAS was r = -0.122 (95% CI [-0.180, -0.064]; Z = -4.092; p < 0.001), indicating a significant, but weak, negative relationship between the measures. Heterogeneity was moderate, but we found no indication of significant differences between patients with medical conditions, psychiatric disorders or healthy controls, nor that mean age or percentage of female subjects moderated the relationship. The overall estimate became somewhat weaker after adjusting for possible publication bias.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that TAS-20 and LEAS measure different aspects of emotional functioning. The small overlap suggests that alexithymia and emotional awareness are distinct constructs of emotional well-being. Clinicians need to assess both aspects when considering treatment options for individual patients. Moreover, from the clinical standpoint, an easy reliable and valid way of measuring emotional awareness is still needed. More research should be focus on the differences between alexithymia and emotional awareness in specific conditions, but also how to integrate self-report instrument and observed based measures in a clinical situation.

AB  - Ketamine is a non-competitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist whose effect in subanesthetic doses has been studied for chronic pain and mood disorders treatment. It has been proposed that ketamine could change the perception of nociceptive stimuli by modulating the cortical connectivity and altering the top-down mechanisms that control conscious pain perception. As this is a strictly central effect, it would be relevant to provide fresh insight into ketamine's effect on cortical response to external stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect the combined synchronic activity of postsynaptic potentials of many cortical pyramidal neurons similarly oriented, being a well-established technique to study cortical responses to sensory input. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the current evidence of subanesthetic ketamine doses on patterns of cortical activity based on ERPs in healthy subjects. To answer the question whether ERPs could be potential markers of the cortical effects of ketamine, we conducted a systematic review of ketamine's effect on ERPs after single and repeated doses. We have searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases and pre-selected 141 articles, 18 of which met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest that after ketamine administration some ERP parameters are reduced (reduced N2, P2, and P3 amplitudes, PN and MMN) while others remain stable or are even increased (P50 reduction, PPI, P1, and N1 amplitudes). The current understanding of these effects is that ketamine alters the perceived contrast between distinct visual and auditory stimuli. The analgesic effect of ketamine might also be influenced by a decreased affective discrimination of sensorial information, a finding from studies using ketamine as a model for schizophrenia, but that can give an important hint not only for the treatment of mood disorders, but also to treat pain and ketamine abuse.

AB  - Interactions among endothelial cells (EC) forming blood vessels and their surrounding cell types are essential to establish the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an integral part of the neurovascular unit (NVU). Research on the NVU has recently seen a renaissance to especially understand the neurobiology of vascular and brain pathologies and their frequently occurring comorbidities. Diverse signaling molecules activated in the near proximity of blood vessels trigger paracellular pathways which regulate the formation and stabilization of tight junctions (TJ) between EC and thereby influence BBB permeability. Among regulatory molecules, the erythropoietin-producing-hepatocellular carcinoma receptors (EphR) and their Eph receptor-interacting signals (ephrins) play a pivotal role in EC differentiation, angiogenesis and BBB integrity. Multiple EphR-ligand interactions between EC and other cell types influence different aspects of angiogenesis and BBB formation. Such interactions additionally control BBB sealing properties and thus the penetration of substances into the brain parenchyma. Thus, they play critical roles in the healthy brain and during the pathogenesis of brain disorders. In this mini-review article, we aim at integrating the constantly growing literature about the functional roles of the EphR/ephrin system for the development of the vascular system and the BBB and in the pathogenesis of neurovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. We suggest the hypothesis that a disrupted EphR/ephrin signaling at the BBB might represent an underappreciated molecular hub of disease comorbidity. Finally, we propose the possibility that the EphR/ephrin system bears the potential of becoming a novel target for the development of alternative therapeutic treatments, focusing on such comorbidities.

AB  - Bacteria and other microorganisms have evolved an ingenious form of life, where they cooperate and improve their chances of survival when subjected to environmental stress, called biofilms. In these communities of adhered cells, bacteria are protected by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that provide protection against e.g., temperature and pH fluctuations, UV exposure, changes in salinity, depletion of nutrients, antimicrobial compounds, and predation. Their success in marine environments and the number of bacterial cells in the sea, allow them to colonize nearly all man-made surfaces in contact with seawater. The costs to maritime transport, aquaculture, oil and gas industries, desalination plants and other industries are significant which has led to the development of various strategies to prevent biofilm formation and cleaning of infected surfaces. In this review, the benefits for bacterial cells to live in biofilms and the consequences to human activities are discussed.

AB  - Background: Clozapine is the antipsychotic of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and has minimal risk for extrapyramidal symptoms. Therapeutic benefits, however, are accompanied by a myriad of cardiometabolic side-effects. The specific reasons for clozapine's high propensity to cause adverse cardiometabolic events remain unknown, but it is believed that autonomic dysfunction may play a role in many of these.
   Objective: This systematic review summarizes the literature on autonomic dysfunction and related cardiovascular side effects associated with clozapine treatment.
   Method: A search of the EMBASE, MEDLINE, and EBM Cochrane databases was conducted using the search terms antipsychotic agents, antipsychotic drug*, antipsychotic*, schizophrenia, schizophren*, psychos*, psychotic*, mental ill*, mental disorder*, neuroleptic*, cardiovascular*, cardiovascular diseases, clozapine*, clozaril*, autonomic*, sympathetic*, catecholamine*, norepinephrine, noradrenaline, epinephrine, adrenaline.
   Results: The search yielded 37 studies that were reviewed, of which only 16 studies have used interventions to manage cardiovascular side effects. Side effects reported in the studies include myocarditis, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. These were attributed to sympathetic hyperactivity, decreased vagal contribution, blockade of cholinergic and adrenergic receptors, reduced heart rate variability and elevated catecholamines with clozapine use. Autonomic neuropathy was identified by monitoring blood pressure and heart rate changes in response to stimuli and by spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Metoprolol, lorazepam, atenolol, propranolol, amlodipine, vasopressin and norepinephrine infusion were used to treat tachycardia and fluctuations in blood pressure, yet results were limited to case reports.
   Conclusion: The results indicate there is a lack of clinical studies investigating autonomic dysfunction and a limited use of interventions to manage cardiovascular side effects associated with clozapine. As there is often no alternative treatment for refractory schizophrenia, the current review highlights the need for better designed studies, use of autonomic tests for prevention of cardiovascular disease and development of novel interventions for clozapine-induced side effects.

AB  - Introduction: It is well-established that low socioeconomic status (SES) influences one's health status, morbidity and mortality. Housing type has been used as an indicator of SES and social determinant of health in some studies. In Singapore, home ownership is among the highest in the world. Citizens who have no other housing options are offered heavily subsidised rental housings. Residents staying in such rental housings are characterised by low socioeconomic status. Our aim is to review studies on the association between staying in public rental housing in Singapore and health status.
   Methods: A PubMed and Scopus search was conducted in January 2017 to identify suitable articles published from 1 January 2000 to 31 January 2017. Only studies that were done on Singapore public rental housing communities were included for review. A total of 14 articles including 4 prospective studies, 8 cross-sectional studies and 2 retrospective cohort studies were obtained for the review. Topics addressed by these studies included: (1) Health status; (2) Health seeking behaviour; (3) Healthcare utilisation.
   Results: Staying in public rental housing was found to be associated with poorer health status and outcomes. They had lower participation in health screening, preferred alternative medicine practitioners to western-trained doctors for primary care, and had increased hospital utilisation. Several studies performed qualitative interviews to explore the causes of disparity and concern about cost was one of the common cited reason.
   Conclusion: Staying in public rental housing appears to be a risk marker of poorer health and this may have important public health implications. Understanding the causes of disparity will require more qualitative studies which in turn will guide interventions and the evaluation of their effectiveness in improving health outcome of this sub-population of patients.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a unique form of programmed death, characterised by cytosolic accumulation of iron, lipid hydroperoxides and their metabolites, and effected by the fatal peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane. It is a major driver of cell death in neurodegenerative neurological diseases. Moreover, cascades underpinning ferroptosis could be active drivers of neuropathology in major psychiatric disorders. Oxidative and nitrosative stress can adversely affect mechanisms and proteins governing cellular iron homeostasis, such as the iron regulatory protein/iron response element system, and can ultimately be a source of abnormally high levels of iron and a source of lethal levels of lipid membrane peroxidation. Furthermore, neuroinflammation leads to the upregulation of divalent metal transported on the surface of astrocytes, microglia and neurones, making them highly sensitive to iron overload in the presence of high levels of non-transferrin-bound iron, thereby affording such levels a dominant role in respect of the induction of iron-mediated neuropathology. Mechanisms governing systemic and cellular iron homeostasis, and the related roles of ferritin and mitochondria are detailed, as are mechanisms explaining the negative regulation of ferroptosis by glutathione, glutathione peroxidase 4, the cysteine/glutamate antiporter system, heat shock protein 27 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. The potential role of DJ-1 inactivation in the precipitation of ferroptosis and the assessment of lipid peroxidation are described. Finally, a rational approach to therapy is considered, with a discussion on the roles of coenzyme Q(10), iron chelation therapy, in the form of deferiprone, deferoxamine (desferrioxamine) and deferasirox, and N-acetylcysteine.

AB  - Childhood is an important and sensitive period for cognitive development. There is limited published research regarding the relationship between sports and cognitive functions in children. We present studies that demonstrate the influence of physical activity on health, especially a positive correlation between sports and cognitive functions. The keywords "children, cognition, cognitive function, physical activity, and brain" were searched for using Psyclnfo, Medline, and Google Scholar, with publication dates ranging from January 2000 to November 2017. Of the 617 results, 58 articles strictly connected to the main topics of physical activity and cognitive functioning were then reviewed. The areas of attention, thinking, language, learning, and memory were analyzed relative to sports and childhood. Results suggest that engaging in sports in late childhood positively influences cognitive and emotional functions. There is a paucity of publications that investigate the impact of sports on pre-adolescents' cognitive functions, or explore which cognitive functions are developed by which sporting disciplines. Such knowledge would be useful in developing training programs for pre-adolescents, aimed at improving cognitive functions that may guide both researchers and practitioners relative to the wide range of benefits that result from physical activity.

AB  - The shortcomings of existing antidepressants used in patients with treatment-resistant depression have evoked much interest in exploring novel yet cost-effective drugs that target N-methyl D-aspartate receptors. In addition to ketamine, evidence for the effectiveness of the antituberculosis drug D-cycloserine (DCS) in this realm has also been steadily accumulating. Systematic searches of the PubMed, Cochrane, and MEDLINE Plus databases were conducted to identify studies on the antidepressant effects of DCS. Results from one case series, four double-blinded trials, and two open-label studies comprising a total of 134 participants who had received DCS are summarized. These studies reported that DCS was safe and well tolerated, and four of them showed a reduction in depressive symptoms without psychomimetic and dissociative effects. We present the limited but convincing evidence to suggest the promising antidepressant properties of DCS when administered independently at high dose or as an adjuvant in controlled settings.

AB  - Proneurotrophins were initially thought to be simple inactive precursors, only responsible for promoting the folding of the mature domain and for the regulation of the neurotrophin secretory pathway. However, recent evidence shows that proneurotrophins can be secreted to the extracellular space, bind with high affinity to specific receptor complexes and induce activation of the apoptotic machinery with subsequent cell death of different neuronal populations. These pathways can be activated due to injury and to several neuro-degenerative disorders, which promote proneurotrophin secretion to the extracellular space. In addition to neuropathology, extracellular proneurotrophins also play a pivotal role in many other cellular mechanisms in the nervous system. Proneurotrophins were shown to mediate synaptic plasticity, namely long-term depression in hippocampal neurons. They are also important in axonal development, and an increase of pro- to mature neurotrophin ratio has been described as a trigger of cell death. The conversion of proneurotrophins into the respective mature form is controlled by the action of several enzymes and regulators. The failure in this regulation is now considered one of the possible mechanisms responsible for pathological cell death associated to proneurotrophins. Here, we discuss the processes behind proneurotrophin action, with particular focus on proBDNF and proNGF and their regulatory pathways. Additionally, we review the most recent studies concerning proneurotrophin involvement in neuronal death, in several disease-associated states in the CNS and PNS, and discuss future avenues of investigation in the proneurotrophin field.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of longitudinal theory of mind (ToM) studies, focusing on the precursors to and functional outcomes of ToM in typically-developing samples. Our search yielded 87 longitudinal studies, all of which involved children and adolescents. Early attention skills, executive function development, and the use of language are precursors to ToM development. Additionally, quality interaction with parents and older siblings can foster early improvements in ToM. Healthy ToM development improves social relationships with peers and produces greater desire to engage in prosocial behaviors. However, victimized individuals with highly-developed ToM may engage in increased aggression. Future longitudinal research is needed to investigate the functional outcomes resulting from ToM changes in adulthood.

KW  - PROMOTION
AB  - Background: Pharmaceutical companies spend large amounts of money promoting their products to physicians. There is evidence that physicians' interactions with pharmaceutical companies negatively affect their prescribing patterns. The objective of this study was to systematically review the extent of the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical companies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Studies assessing the extent of any type of interaction between practicing physicians and pharmaceutical companies were eligible. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases in July 2016. Reviewers worked in duplicate and independently to complete study selection, data abstraction and assessment of methodological features. We summarized the findings narratively. Results: We included 11 eligible studies (7 quantitative and 4 qualitative). Quantitative studies found that pharmaceutical company representatives visited at least 90% of physicians. Printed material, stationery items and drug samples were the most frequently received gifts. Two of the studies assessing direct payment found percentages of 16 and 5%, respectively. Findings of qualitative studies were consistent with those of quantitative studies. In addition, they revealed an increasing tendency for pharmaceutical companies to provide expensive personal gifts, sponsor social events and offer cash as inducements to physicians based on their demands. They also identified building personal relationships, creating a sense of indebtedness and emotional blackmailing as commonly used techniques to influence physicians. Conclusion: A relatively high percentage of physicians in LMICs interact with pharmaceutical companies. Findings have implications for policy and practice, given the current extent of interaction is likely affecting the prescribing habits and professional behaviour of physicians.

AB  - Emil Kraepelin's psychiatric nosology, proposedin the 5thand 6th editions of his textbook published in 1896 and 1899, did not quickly gain worldwide acceptance, but was instead met with substantial and sustained criticism. The authors review critiques of Kraepelin's work published in his lifetime by Adolf Meyer, Friedrich Jolly, Eugenio Tanzi, Alfred Hoche, Karl Jaspers, and Willy Hellpach. These critics made six major points. First, Kraepelin's new categories of dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity were too broad and too heterogeneous. Second, his emphasis on course of illness was misconceived, as the same disease can result in brief episodes or a chronic course. Third, the success of his system was based on the quality of his textbooks and his academic esteem, rather than on empirical findings. Fourth, his focus on symptoms and signs led to neglect of the whole patient and his or her life story. Fifth, Kraepelin's early emphasis on experimental psychology did not bear the expected fruit. Sixth, Kraepelin was committed to the application of the medical disease model. However, because of the many-to-many relationship between brain pathology and psychiatric symptoms, true natural disease entities may not exist in psychiatry. Most of the ongoing debates about Kraepelin's nosology have roots in these earlier discussions and would be enriched by a deeper appreciation of their historical contexts. As authoritative as Kraepelin was, and remains today, his was only one among many voices, and attention to them would be well repaid by a deeper understanding of the fundamental conceptual challenges in our field.

AB  - LGBT clients have unique healthcare needs but experience a wide range of quality in the care that they receive. This study provides a summary of clinical guideline recommendations related to the provision of primary care and family planning services for LGBT clients. In addition, we identify gaps in current guidelines, and inform future recommendations and guidance for clinical practice and research. PubMed, Cochrane, and Agency for Health-care Research and Quality electronic bibliographic databases, and relevant professional organizations' websites, were searched to identify clinical guidelines related to the provision of primary care and family planning services for LGBT clients. Information obtained from a technical expert panel was used to inform the review. Clinical guidelines meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed to determine their alignment with Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards for the development of clinical practice guidelines and content relevant to the identified themes. The search parameters identified 2,006 clinical practice guidelines. Seventeen clinical guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Two of the guidelines met all eight IOM criteria. However, many recommendations were consistent regarding provision of services to LGBT clients within the following themes: clinic environment, provider cultural sensitivity and awareness, communication, confidentiality, coordination of care, general clinical principles, mental health considerations, and reproductive health. Guidelines for the primary and family planning care of LGBT clients are evolving. The themes identified in this review may guide professional organizations during guideline development, clinicians when providing care, and researchers conducting LGBT-related studies.

AB  - Background: Eating disorders are serious mental disorders and are associated with substantial economic and social burden. The aim of this study is to undertake a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness studies of both preventive and treatment interventions for eating disorder.
   Method: Electronic databases (including the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, Global Health, CINAHL complete, Health Business Elite, Econlit, Health Policy Reference Center and ERIC) were searched for published cost-effectiveness studies of eating disorder prevention and treatment including papers published up to January 2017. The quality of studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.
   Results: In all, 13 studies met the review inclusion criteria as full cost-effectiveness studies and 8 were published since 2011. The studies included three modelled and one trial-based study focused on prevention, two trial-based and one modelled study for anorexia nervosa treatment and three trial-based studies for bulimia nervosa treatment. The remaining studies targeted binge-eating disorder or non-specific eating disorder treatment. The average percent of CHEERS checklist items reported was 71% (standard deviation 21%). Eating disorder interventions were mainly cost-saving or more effective and more costly compared to comparators; however, some results did not reach statistical significance. In the two studies that achieved 100% CHEERS checklist, one study reported that a cognitive dissonance intervention might be cost-effective for prevention of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with a 90% participation rate and the second study supported lisdexamfetamine to be cost-effective in the treatment of binge-eating disorder. Insufficient evidence for long-term cost-effectiveness (e.g. over 2years) was found.
   Conclusion: Cost-effectiveness studies in eating disorder appear to be increasing in number over the last 6years. Findings were inconsistent and no firm conclusion can be drawn with regard to comparative value-for-money conclusions. However, some promising interventions were identified. Further research with improved methodology is required.

AB  - There is copious evidence of abnormalities in resting-state functional network connectivity states, grey and white matter pathology and impaired cerebral perfusion in patients afforded a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, major depression or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (myalgic encephalomyelitis). Systemic inflammation may well be a major element explaining such findings. Inter-patient and inter-illness variations in neuroimaging findings may arise at least in part from regional genetic, epigenetic and environmental variations in the functions of microglia and astrocytes. Regional differences in neuronal resistance to oxidative and inflammatory insults and in the performance of antioxidant defences in the central nervous system may also play a role. Importantly, replicated experimental findings suggest that the use of high-resolution SPECT imaging may have the capacity to differentiate patients afforded a diagnosis of CFS from those with a diagnosis of depression. Further research involving this form of neuroimaging appears warranted in an attempt to overcome the problem of aetiologically heterogeneous cohorts which probably explain conflicting findings produced by investigative teams active in this field. However, the ionising radiation and relative lack of sensitivity involved probably preclude its use as a routine diagnostic tool.

AB  - Human exposure to neurotoxic pollutants (e.g. metals, pesticides and other chemicals) is recognized as a key risk factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging evidence indicates that an alteration in autophagic pathways may be correlated with the onset of the neurotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to these pollutants. In fact, autophagy is a natural process that permits to preserving cell homeostasis, through the seizure and degradation of the cytosolic damaged elements. However, when an excessive level of intracellular damage is reached, the autophagic process may also induce cell death. A correct modulation of specific stages of autophagy is important to maintain the correct balance in the organism. In this review, we highlight the critical role that autophagy plays in neurotoxicity induced by the most common classes of environmental contaminants. The understanding of this mechanism may be helpful to discover a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce side effects induced by these compounds. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phthalates have been blended in various compositions as plasticizers worldwide for a variety of purposes. Consequently, humans are exposed to a wide spectrum of phthalates that needs to be researched and understood correctly. The goal of this review is to focus on phthalate's internal exposure pathways and possible role of human digestion on liver toxicity. In addition, special focus was made on stem cell therapy in reverting liver toxicity. The known entry of higher molecular weight phthalates is through ingestion while inhalation and dermal pathways are for lower molecular weight phthalates. In human body, certain phthalates are digested through phase 1 (hydrolysis, oxidation) and phase 2 (conjugation) metabolic processes. The phthalates that are made bioavailable through digestion enter the blood stream and reach the liver for further detoxification, and these are excreted via urine and/or feces. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a compound well studied involving human metabolism. Liver plays a pivotal role in humans for detoxification of pollutants. Thus, continuous exposure to phthalates in humans may lead to inhibition of liver detoxifying enzymes and may result in liver dysfunction. The potential of stem cell therapy addressed herewith will revert liver dysfunction and lead to restoration of liver function properly.

AB  - Mental contamination is defined and the main features of the phenomenon are set out. In addition to the familiar form of abnormal mental contamination, as evident in psychological disorders, notably Obsessive-compulsive Disorder, the phenomenon of non-clinical mental contamination is common. The clinical form is distressing, uncontrollable, constant and dysfunctional. The normal phenomenon can be disturbing but it is usually dormant, evoked intermittently, transient, tolerable, manageable, not dysfunctional and psychologically fascinating. The cognitive theory of mental contamination encompasses the causes of mental contamination, its persistence, and individual vulnerability. The field would benefit greatly from additional work, such as that reported elsewhere in this Special Issue, to incorporate the unusual manifestations of visual contamination, morphing and self-contamination, and to account for the experience of mental contamination in nonclinical and other clinical manifestations.

KW  - WORK
AB  - Background: Since the global economic crisis in 2007, unemployment rates have escalated in most European and North American countries. Unemployment protection policies, particularly the unemployment insurance (UI) system, have become a weighty issue for many modern welfare states. Decades of research have established concrete findings on the adverse impacts of unemployment on poverty-and health-related outcomes. This provided a foundation for further exploration into the potential protective effects of UI in offsetting these adverse outcomes. Methods: We developed a systematic review protocol in four stages (literature search, study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal) to ensure a rigorous data collection and inter-rated reliability. We examined the full body of empirical research published between 2000 and 2013 on the pathways by which UI impacts poverty and health. Results: Out of 2233 primary studies identified, a total of 12 met our inclusion criteria. The selected studies assessed poverty-related outcomes (absolute/relative poverty and material hardship) or one or more health-related outcomes (health behaviors, self-rated health, well-being and mental health). Across various UI systems, jurisdictions from high income countries, and study designs, we found good support for our conceptual framework, by which UI attenuates the effect of unemployment on both poverty and health, with a few exceptions. Conclusion: Whether UI impacts differ by age and region might be explored further in future research. The complex mediating relationship between unemployment, UI, poverty and health should further be assessed in light of economic and historical contexts. This could inform decision-making processes during future periods of economic recession.

Relevant clinical studies on human subjects involving choice of anaesthetic, ventilation and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in the ECT setting were considered. The references of relevant studies were likewise considered.ResultsPropofol yields the shortest seizures, etomidate and ketamine the longest. Etomidate and ketamine+propofol 1 : 1 seems to yield the seizures with best quality. Seizure quality is improved when induction of ECT is delayed until the effect of the anaesthetic has waned - possibly monitored with BIS values. Manual hyperventilation with 100% O-2 may increase the pO(2)/pCO(2)-ratio, which may be correlated with better seizure quality.ConclusionEtomidate or a 1 : 1 ketamine and propofol combination may be the best method to achieve general anaesthesia in the ECT setting. There is a need for large randomised prospective studies comparing the effect of methohexital, thiopental, propofol, ketamine, propofol+ketamine 1 : 1 and etomidate in the ECT treatment of major depressed patients. These studies should investigate safety and side effects, and most importantly have antidepressant efficacy and cognitive side effects as outcome measures instead of seizure quality.

AB  - Cadmium has been proposed to be the one of the factors of atherosclerosis development, although the existing data are still controversial. The primary objective of the present study is the review and the meta-analysis of studies demonstrating the association between Cd exposure and atherosclerosis as well as review of the potential mechanisms of such association. We performed a systematic search in the PubMed-Medline database using the MeSH terms cadmium, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, mortality and humans up through December 20, 2017. Elevated urinary Cd levels were associated with increased mortality for cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.07-1.67) as well as elevated blood Cd levels (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.24-2.56). Analysis restricted to never smokers showed similar, though more imprecise, results. Consistently, we also observed an association between Cd exposure markers (blood and urine) and coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Moreover, Cd exposure was associated with atherogenic changes in lipid profile. High Cd exposure was associated with higher TC levels (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.10-2.01), higher LDL-C levels (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.99-1.73) and lower HDL-C levels (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.09-3.55). The mechanisms of atherogenic effect of cadmium may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, enhanced lipid synthesis, up-regulation of adhesion molecules, prostanoid dysbalance, as well as altered glycosaminoglycan synthesis.

AB  - Background. Deficiencies in older people's social relationships (including loneliness, social isolation, and low social support) have been implicated as a cause of premature mortality and increased morbidity. Whether they affect service use is unclear.
   Objectives. To determine whether social relationships are associated with older adults' use of health services, independently of health-related needs.
   Search Methods. We searched 8 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Webof Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) for data published between 1983 and 2016. We also identified relevant sources from scanning the reference lists of included studies and review articles, contacting authors to identify additional studies, and searching the tables of contents of key journals.
   Selection Criteria. Studies met inclusion criteria if more than 50% of participants were older than 60 years or meanage was older than 60 years; they included a measure of social networks, received social support, or perceived support; and they reported quantitative data on the association between social relationships and older adults' health service utilization.
   Data Collection and Analysis. Two researchers independently screened studies for inclusion. They extracted data and appraised study quality by using standardized forms. In a narrative synthesis, we grouped the studies according to the outcome of interest (physician visits, hospital admissions, hospital readmissions, emergency department use, hospital length of stay, utilization of home- and community-based services, contact with general health services, and mental health service use) and the domain of social relationships covered (social networks, received social support, or perceived support). For each service type and social relationship domain, we assessed the strength of the evidence across studies according to the quantity and quality of studies and consistency of findings.
   Main Results. The literature search retrieved 26 077 citations, 126 of which met inclusion criteria. Data were reported across 226 678 participants from 19 countries. We identified strong evidence of an association between weaker social relationships and increased rates of readmission to hospital (75% of high-quality studies reported evidence of an association in the same direction). In evidence of moderate strength, according to 2 high-quality and 3 medium-quality studies, smaller social networks were associated with longer hospital stays. When we considered received and perceived social support separately, they were not linked to health care use. Overall, the evidence did not indicate that older patients with weaker social relationships place greater demands on ambulatory care (including physician visits and community- or home-based services) than warranted by their needs.
   Authors' Conclusions. Current evidence does not support the view that, independently of health status, older patients with lower levels of social support place greater demands on ambulatory care. Future research on social relationships would benefit from a consensus on clinically relevant concepts to measure.
   Public Health Implications. Our findings are important for public health because they challenge the notion that lonely older adults are a burden on all health and social care services. In high-income countries, interventions aimed at reducing social isolation and loneliness are promoted as a means of preventing inappropriate service use. Our review cautions against assuming that reductions in care utilization can be achieved by intervening to strengthen social relationships.

AB  - Although numerous studies have investigated the association of ambient air pollution with hypertension and blood pressure (BP), the results were inconsistent. We performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies. Seven international and Chinese databases were searched for studies examining the associations of particulate (diameter<2.5 mu m (PM2.5), 2.5-10 mu m (PM2.5-10) or >10 mu m (PM10)) and gaseous (sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO)) air pollutants with hypertension or BP. Odds ratios (OR), regression coefficients (beta) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis were also conducted. The overall meta-analysis showed significant associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 with hypertension (OR = 1.05), and of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 with DBP (beta values: 0.47-0.86 mmHg). In addition, short-term exposures to four (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2), two (PM2.5 and SO2), and four air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2), were significantly associated with hypertension (ORS: 1.05-1.10), SBP (beta values: 0.53-0.75 mmHg) and DBP (beta values: 0.15-0.64 mmHg), respectively. Stratified analyses showed a generally stronger relationship among studies of men, Asians, North Americans, and areas with higher air pollutant levels. In conclusion, our study indicates a positive association between ambient air pollution and increased BP and hypertension. Geographical and socio-demographic factors may modify the pro hypertensive effects of air pollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global application of nitrogen is far greater than phosphorus, and it is widely involved in the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs. We used a bibliometric method to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate nitrogen research in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs to reveal research developments, current research hotspots, and emerging trends in this area. A total of 2695 articles in the past 25 years from the online database of the Scientific Citation Index Expended (SCI-Expanded) were analyzed. Articles in this area increased exponentially from 1991 to 2015. Although the USA was the most productive country over the past 25 years, China achieved the top position in terms of yearly publications after 2010. The most active keywords related to nitrogen in the past 25 years included phosphorus, nutrients, sediment, chlorophyll-a, carbon, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, water quality, modeling, and stable isotopes, based on analysis within 5-year intervals from 1991 to 2015 as well as the entire past 25 years. In addition, researchers have drawn increasing attention to denitrification, climate change, and internal loading. Future trends in this area should focus on: (1) nutrient amounts, ratios, and major nitrogen sources leading to eutrophication; (2) nitrogen transformation and the bioavailability of different nitrogen forms; (3) nitrogen budget, mass balance model, control, and management; (4) ecosystem responses to nitrogen enrichment and reduction, as well as the relationships between these responses; and (5) interactions between nitrogen and other stressors (e.g., light intensity, carbon, phosphorus, toxic contaminants, climate change, and hydrological variations) in terms of eutrophication.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this review was to objectively evaluate the effects of Baduanjin exercise on rehabilitative outcomes in stroke patients. Methods: Both Chinese and English electronic databases were searched for potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently screened eligible trials against the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality by using the revised PEDro scale. Meta-analysis was only performed for balance function. Results: In total, there were eight randomized controlled trials selected in this systematic review. The aggregated result of four trials has shown a significant benefit in favor of Baduanjin on balance function (Hedges' g = 2.39, 95% CI 2.14 to 2.65, p < 0.001, I-2 = 61.54). Additionally, Baduanjin exercise effectively improved sensorimotor function of lower extremities and ability of daily activities as well as reduced depressive level, leading to improved quality of life. Conclusion: Baduanjin exercise as an adjunctive and safe method may be conducive to help stroke patients achieve the best possible short-term outcome and should be integrated with mainstream rehabilitation programs. More rigorous randomized controlled trials with long-term intervention periods among a large sample size of stroke patients are needed to draw a firm conclusion regarding the rehabilitative effects for this population.

AB  - Operant behavior is not only regulated by factors related to the quality or quantity of reinforcement, but also by the work requirements inherent in performing instrumental actions. Moreover, organisms often make effort-related decisions involving economic choices such as cost/benefit analyses. Effort-based decision making is studied using behavioral procedures that offer choices between high-effort options leading to relatively preferred reinforcers vs. low effort/low reward choices. Several neural systems, including the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and other brain circuits, are involved in regulating effort-related aspects of motivation. Considerable evidence indicates that mesolimbic DA transmission exerts a bi-directional control over exertion of effort on instrumental behavior tasks. Interference with DA transmission produces a low-effort bias in animals tested on effort-based choice tasks, while increasing DA transmission with drugs such as DA transport blockers tends to enhance selection of high-effort options. The results from these pharmacology studies are corroborated by the findings from recent articles using optogenetic, chemogenetic and physiological techniques. In addition to providing important information about the neural regulation of motivated behavior, effort-based choice tasks are useful for developing animal models of some of the motivational symptoms that are seen in people with various psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease). Studies of effort-based decision making may ultimately contribute to the development of novel drug treatments for motivational dysfunction.

AB  - In both excitable and non-excitable cells, calcium (Ca2+) signals are maintained by a highly integrated process involving store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), namely the opening of plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ channels following the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Upon depletion of Ca2+ store, the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) senses Ca2+ level reduction and migrates from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like sites to the PM where it activates the channel proteins Orai and/or the transient receptor potential channels (TRPC) prompting Ca2+ refilling. Accumulating evidence suggests that SOCE dysregulation may trigger perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in neurons, glia or hematopoietic cells, thus participating to the pathogenesis of diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Under acute conditions, such as ischemic stroke, neuronal SOCE can either re-establish Ca2+ homeostasis or mediate Ca2+ overload, thus providing a non-excitotoxic mechanism of ischemic neuronal death. The dualistic role of SOCE in brain ischemia is further underscored by the evidence that it also participates to endothelial restoration and to the stabilization of intravascular thrombi. In Parkinson's disease (PD) models, loss of SOCE triggers ER stress and dysfunction/degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Disruption of neuronal SOCE also underlies Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, since both in genetic mouse models and in human sporadic AD brain samples, reduced SOCE contributes to synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Unlike the AD setting, in the striatum from Huntington's disease (HD) transgenic mice, an increased STIM2 expression causes elevated synaptic SOCE that was suggested to underlie synaptic loss in medium spiny neurons. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of SOCE is beneficial to synapse maintenance in HD models, whereas the same approach may be anticipated to be detrimental to cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, up-regulation of SOCE may be beneficial during AD. These intriguing findings highlight the importance of further mechanistic studies to dissect the molecular pathways, and their corresponding targets, involved in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss during aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: It is an important objective of the psychiatric services to keep the use of involuntary procedures to a minimum, as the use of coercion involves clinical, ethical, and legal issues. It has been claimed that Norway has a relatively high rate of involuntary admissions. We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature on the use of involuntary admission in Norway, with the purpose of identifying the current state of knowledge and areas in need of further research.
   Methods: A systematic review following the PRISMA statement was conducted. We searched the electronic databases PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase for studies relating to involuntary admission to Norwegian adult psychiatric hospitals published in the period 1 January 2001 to 8 August 2016. The database searches were supplemented with manual searches of relevant journals, reference lists, and websites.
   Results: Seventy-four articles were included and grouped into six categories based on their main topics: Patients' experiences, satisfaction and perceived coercion (21 articles), the Referral and admission process (11 articles), Rates of admission (8 articles), Characteristics of the patients (17 articles), Staff attitudes (9 articles), and Outcomes (8 articles). Four of the included articles described intervention studies. Fifty-seven of the articles had a quantitative design, 16 had a qualitative design, and one a mixed-method design. There was a broad range of topics that were studied and considerable variation in study designs. The findings were largely in line with the international literature, but the particularities of Norwegian legislation and the Norwegian health services were reflected in the literature. The four intervention studies explored interventions for reducing rates of involuntary admission, such as modifying referring routines, improving patient information procedures, and increasing patients' say in the admission process, and represent an important avenue for future research on involuntary admission in Norway.
   Conclusions: The review suggests that Norway has a relatively high rate of involuntary admissions. The identified studies represent a broad mix of topics and designs. Four intervention studies were identified. More studies with strong designs are needed to bring research on involuntary admission in Norway to a next level.

AB  - Inflammation is a complex biological response fundamental to how the body deals with injury and infection to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury and effect repair. Unlike a normally beneficial acute inflammatory response, chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage and ultimately its destruction, and often results from an inappropriate immune response. Inflammation in the nervous system ("neuroinflammation"), especially when prolonged, can be particularly injurious. While inflammation per se may not cause disease, it contributes importantly to disease pathogenesis across both the peripheral (neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia) and central [e.g., Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, ischemia and traumatic brain injury, depression, and autism spectrum disorder] nervous systems. The existence of extensive lines of communication between the nervous system and immune system represents a fundamental principle underlying neuroinflammation. Immune cell-derived inflammatory molecules are critical for regulation of host responses to inflammation. Although these mediators can originate from various non-neuronal cells, important sources in the above neuropathologies appear to be microglia and mast cells, together with astrocytes and possibly also oligodendrocytes. Understanding neuroinflammation also requires an appreciation that non-neuronal cell-cell interactions, between both glia and mast cells and glia themselves, are an integral part of the inflammation process. Within this context the mast cell occupies a key niche in orchestrating the inflammatory process, from initiation to prolongation. This review will describe the current state of knowledge concerning the biology of neuroinflammation, emphasizing mast cell-glia and glia-glia interactions, then conclude with a consideration of how a cell's endogenousmechanisms might be leveraged to provide a therapeutic strategy to target neuroinflammation.

AB  - Major depressive episodes are the largest cause of psychiatric disability, and can often resist treatment with medication and psychotherapy. Advances in the understanding of the neural circuit basis of depression, combined with the success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders, spurred several groups to test DBS for treatment-resistant depression. Multiple brain sites have now been stimulated in open-label and blinded studies. Initial open-label results were dramatic, but follow-on controlled/blinded clinical trials produced inconsistent results, with both successes and failures to meet endpoints. Data from follow-on studies suggest that this is because DBS in these trials was not targeted to achieve physiologic responses. We review these results within a technology-lifecycle framework, in which these early trial "failures" are a natural consequence of over-enthusiasm for an immature technology. That framework predicts that from this "valley of disillusionment," DBS may be nearing a "slope of enlightenment." Specifically, by combining recent mechanistic insights and the maturing technology of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), the next generation of trials will be better able to target pathophysiology. Key to that will be the development of closed-loop systems that semi-autonomously alter stimulation strategies based on a patient's individual phenotype. Such next-generation DBS approaches hold great promise for improving psychiatric care.

AB  - Long-lasting memories form the basis of our identity as individuals and lie central in shaping future behaviours that guide survival. Surprisingly, however, our current knowledge of how such memories are stored in the brain and retrieved, as well as the dynamics of the circuits involved, remains scarce despite seminal technical and experimental breakthroughs in recent years. Traditionally, it has been proposed that, over time, information initially learnt in the hippocampus is stored in distributed cortical networks. This process-the standard theory of memory consolidation-would stabilize the newly encoded information into a lasting memory, become independent of the hippocampus, and remain essentially unmodifiable throughout the lifetime of the individual. In recent years, several pieces of evidence have started to challenge this view and indicate that long-lasting memories might already ab ovo be encoded, and subsequently stored in distributed cortical networks, akin to the multiple trace theory of memory consolidation. In this review, we summarize these recent findings and attempt to identify the biologically plausible mechanisms based on which a contextual memory becomes remote by integrating different levels of analysis: from neural circuits to cell ensembles across synaptic remodelling and epigenetic modifications. From these studies, remote memory formation and maintenance appear to occur through a multi-trace, dynamic and integrative cellular process ranging from the synapse to the nucleus, and represent an exciting field of research primed to change quickly as new experimental evidence emerges.

AB  - Impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) have been proposed to underlie the clinical symptoms of drug addiction as mediated by cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical networks. The bulk of evidence supporting the iRISA model comes from neuroimaging research that has focused on cortical and striatal influences with less emphasis on the role of the thalamus. Here, we highlight the importance of the thalamus in drug addiction, focusing on animal literature findings on thalamic nuclei in the context of drug-seeking, structural and functional changes of the thalamus as measured by imaging studies in human drug addiction, particularly during drug cue and non-drug reward processing, and response inhibition tasks. Findings from the animal literature suggest that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the lateral habenula and the mediodorsal nucleus may be involved in the reinstatement, extinction and expression of drug-seeking behaviours. In support of the iRISA model, the human addiction imaging literature demonstrates enhanced thalamus activation when reacting to drug cues and reduced thalamus activation during response inhibition. This pattern of response was further associated with the severity of, and relapse in, drug addiction. Future animal studies could widen their field of focus by investigating the specific role(s) of different thalamic nuclei in different phases of the addiction cycle. Similarly, future human imaging studies should aim to specifically delineate the structure and function of different thalamic nuclei, for example, through the application of advanced imaging protocols at higher magnetic fields (7 Tesla).

AB  - Background: It remains unclear whether cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with depression in the general elderly population. We thus performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between depression and CMBs.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science for relevant studies that assessed the relationship between depression and the prevalence of CMBs.
   Results: Five eligible studies including 7,328 patients were pooled in meta-analysis. The prevalence of CMBs was 18.0%. The prevalence of depression was 11.1%. The pooled analysis demonstrated odds ratio for CMBs and depression to be 1.187 (95% confidence interval 1.005-1.403; p = 0.043) with no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 0.0%, p = 0.621).
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of available published data indicated an increased prevalence of depression in the subjects with pre-existing CMBs. This finding supports the vascular depression hypothesis. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of CMBs in the pathogenesis and progression of depression, which might provide a potential target for the prevention and treatment.

AB  - Antidepressant medications are the most common treatment for major depression and related disorders. Pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that response to these medications is associated with genetic variation. While these studies have been invaluable they have yet to explain why a significant number of patients do not respond to their initial medication. The epigenetic modification known as DNA methylation has recently been studied in the context of antidepressant treatment response. As such, the purpose of this article is to review the advances made in the relatively new field of pharmaco-epigenetics of antidepressant response. We included all published articles examining DNA methylation in association with antidepressant treatment response in Major Depressive Disorder from April 2006 to June 2016 using the PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. At the present time, although original articles are limited, epigenetic modifications of SLC6A4, BDNF, and IL11 genes are showing promising results as biomarkers for prediction of antidepressant response. However, research methods and results are heterogeneous and additional studies are required before results are generalizable. At the end of this review we provide recommendations for study design and analytic approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most prevalent and chronic conditions of childhood. Various factors including biological and dietary factors along with an overlay of parental social factors have been found to be associated with the progression of ECC. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize available literature and to identify parent-level proximal and distal risk factors associated with the development of ECC in developing nations.
   Methods: Studies conducted in developing nations, published between 2005 and 2017 in English, that included children younger than 6 years and examined ECC were included. The outcome of interest were parental risk factors, which included parental knowledge, behavior, attitudes, sense of coherence (SOC), stress, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and breastfeeding duration. The studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, Ovid Medline, and PubMed.
   Results: The search yielded 325 studies, of which 18 were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. Ten studies found maternal education, and seven studies found parental education to be significantly associated with ECC. SES was significantly associated with ECC in 13 studies in the form of annual household income and occupation level. Four studies observed the significant association between oral health knowledge and attitudes with ECC, whereas only two studies found maternal attitude to be associated with ECC. Breastfeeding duration was a significant risk factor in four studies. One study each found significant associations of SOC, parental distress, and secondary smoke with ECC.
   Conclusion: To date, most of the researches done in developing countries have reported distal parental factors such as income and education being significant risk factors in caries development compared to proximal risk factors in low-income groups. Only a few studies analyzed the psychosocial and behavioral factors. Interventions could be designed to improve parental oral health knowledge and behaviors in these nations.

AB  - Background: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic skin disease, linked to poverty, and belonging to the group of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Depending on the severity, the type of lesions or scars, and the context, CL can lead to self-and social stigma influencing the quality of life and psychological well-being of the patient. This dimension is, however, little documented for the most common, localized form of cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). We aimed to describe the current knowledge on the psychological burden and the stigma related to LCL.
   Methods: The population of interest for this scoping review are patients or their relatives with localized LCL or related scars. We searched the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, POPLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Global Health, and LILACS, for articles written in Arabic, English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, or Spanish, and published until the end of August 2017.
   Results: From 2485 initial records, 15 papers met our inclusion criteria. Dermatology life quality index was the most frequent used scale to assess LCL psychological impact in quantitative studies. Six qualitative studies used individual interviews and/or focus groups discussions to explore the psychological and/or the social burden of this disease. Quantitative assessments using standard scales as well as qualitative research asserts that LCL is a source of psychological suffering, stigmatization, and decreased quality of life (QoL).
   Conclusion: Most studies showed that LCL has a significant negative effect on the QoL and mental health. However, the fact that the psychosocial burden generated by LCL is time-dependent makes it hard to measure. We recommend to develop a more specific and validated assessment scale to appreciate the full burden of this disease and enhance comparability of findings.

AB  - Recent evidence implicates immune alterations and gut microbiota dysbiosis in at least some subpopulations of individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). Immune and gut alterations in ASD have mostly been studied separately, and the reviews and theoretical models up to now have mainly considered the immune system as one of the routes for gut-brain communication. We take a different perspective and consider possible common mechanisms of action for the gut microbiota and inflammation on the neural basis of ASD. We propose these to be their effects on ASD-susceptibility genes, neurodevelopment, and intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity. We then use these common mechanisms to offer pathways for potentially beneficial effects of early-life probiotics on the neural development in ASD. This new perspective yields a conceptual framework for creating effective preventions for mothers at risk of giving birth to children with ASD. Such a framework may also inform effective interventions targeting these common mechanisms of action, which may be shared in many ASD cases regardless of their different etiological profiles. Probiotics may be one example of such preventions and interventions. Finally, the common mechanisms offered by this perspective can be useful in the search of comprehensive theories that can account for the complete neurobiological and behavioral symptoms of ASD.

AB  - Blast exposures are associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-induced TBIs are common injuries affecting military personnel. Department of Defense and Veterans Administration (DoD/VA) reports for TBI indicated that the vast majority (82.3%) has been mild TBI (mTBI)/concussion. mTBI and associated posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) have been called "the invisible injury" of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These injuries induce varying degrees of neuropathological alterations and, in some cases, chronic cognitive, behavioral and neurological disorders. Appropriate animal models of blast-induced TBI will not only assist the understanding of physical characteristics of the blast, but also help to address the potential mechanisms. This report provides a brief overview of physical principles of blast, injury mechanisms related to blast exposure, current blast animal models, and the neurological behavioral and neuropathological findings related to blast injury in experimental settings. We describe relationships between blast peak pressures and the observed injuries. We also report preliminary use of a highly reproducible and intensity-graded blast murine model carried out in open-field with explosives, and describe physical and pathological findings in this experimental model. Our results indicate close relationships between blast intensities and neuropathology and behavioral deficits, particularly at low level blast intensities relevant to mTBI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several lines of evidence place alpha-synuclein (aSyn) at the center of Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, but it is still unclear why overexpression or mutated forms of this protein affect some neuronal populations more than others. Susceptible neuronal populations in PD, dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the locus coeruleus (LC), are distinguished by relatively high cytoplasmic concentrations of dopamine and calcium ions. Here we review the evidence for the multi-hit hypothesis of neurodegeneration, including recent papers that demonstrate synergistic interactions between aSyn, calcium ions and dopamine that may lead to imbalanced protein turnover and selective susceptibility of these neurons. We conclude that decreasing the levels of any one of these toxicity mediators can be beneficial for the survival of SNpc and LC neurons, providing multiple opportunities for targeted drug interventions aimed at modifying the course of PD.

AB  - Background: One of the main obstacles in studying suicide risk factors is the difference between cases in which the individual died by suicide and those in which the individual engaged in suicidal behavior. A promising strategy that overcomes this obstacle is the study of survivors of serious suicide attempt (SSA), i.e., an attempt that would have been lethal had it not been for the provision of rapid and effective emergency treatment. Serious suicide attempters are epidemiologically very much like those who died by suicide, and thus may serve as valid proxies for studying suicides. This paper aims to define the specific risk factors for SSAs by conducting a qualitative data synthesis of existing studies.
   Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of the literature in PubMed, ProQuest, and Psychlit electronic research-literature databases. Search terms were "serious" "OR" "near lethal," combined with the Boolean "AND" operator with "suicide*." In addition, we performed a manual search on Google Scholar for further studies not yet identified.
   Results: The preliminary search identified 683 citations. A total of 39 research reports that met the predefined criteria were analyzed. Mental pain, communication difficulties, decision-making impulsivity, and aggression, as well as several demographic variables, were found to be major risk factors for SSAs.
   Limitations: We found a variability of definitions for SSA that hamper the ability to draw a model for the risk factors and processes that facilitate it. Moreover, the role of suicide intent and planning in SSA is still unclear. Further studies should aim to clarify and refine the concepts and measures of SSA, thereby enabling more specific and concrete modeling of the psychological element in its formation.
   Conclusion: SSA is a distinguishable phenomenon that needs to be addressed specifically within the scope of suicidal behavior. Interpersonal problems, as well as impulsivity and aggression, seem to facilitate SSA when mental pain serves as a secondary factor. Healthcare professionals should be aware of SSA, and familiar with its specific risk factors. Moreover, psychological and suicidal risk assessment should include a designated evaluation of these risk factors as part of intervention and prevention models for SSA.

TI  - THE VICTORIAN MENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - In a 1990 review of Jenny Bourne Taylor's In the Secret Theatre of Home: Wilkie Collins, Sensation Narrative, and Nineteenth-Century Psychology (1988), Lawrence Rothfield commented that the book explores what until recently might have seemed a bizarrely specialized cultural context and an equally obscure literary phenomenon (97). Rothfield argued that Taylor's study was representative of the recent move to new historicist methodologies, which made contexts and authors once considered to be historical footnotes important to scholarship. Prior to that shift, [n]ineteenth-century English psychology, a mishmash of scientifically dubious theories and practices such as phrenology, physiognomy, moral management, and mesmerism, hardly seemed key to understanding the broad cultural issues of concern as traditionally construed in Victorian studies (97). Strikingly, now some twenty-five years later, knowledge of nineteenth-century psychology seems essential to the field. Presses, alert to that shift, have republished out-of-print literary studies that explored Victorian literature in relation to psychology in the years preceding the current surge of interest in the subject. (Faas's 1989 Retreat into the Mind: Victorian Poetry and the Rise of Psychiatry was reissued by Princeton University Press in a 2016 hardcover edition. Kearns's 1987 Metaphors of Mind in Fiction and Psychology was reissued in 2014 by the University of Kentucky Press.) Judging by the number of publications in the area, as well as by titles on the programs of recent conferences, the sciences of the mind have become one of the central topics in Victorian studies.

AB  - Mitochondria are key regulators of cell fate during disease. They control cell survival via the production of ATP that fuels cellular processes and, conversely, cell death via the induction of apoptosis through release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome C. Therefore, it is essential to have stringent quality control mechanisms to ensure a healthy mitochondrial network. Quality control mechanisms are largely regulated by mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. The processes of mitochondrial fission (division) and fusion allow for damaged mitochondria to be segregated and facilitate the equilibration of mitochondrial components such as DNA, proteins, and metabolites. The process of mitophagy are responsible for the degradation and recycling of damaged mitochondria. These mitochondrial quality control mechanisms have been well studied in chronic and acute pathologies such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction, but less is known about how these two processes interact and contribute to specific pathophysiologic states. To date, evidence for the role of mitochondrial quality control in acute and chronic disease is divergent and suggests that mitochondrial quality control processes can serve both survival and death functions depending on the disease state. This review aims to provide a synopsis of the molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial quality control, to summarize our current understanding of the complex role that mitochondrial quality control plays in the progression of acute vs chronic diseases and, finally, to speculate on the possibility that targeted manipulation of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms may be exploited for the rationale design of novel therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Aims: Numerous measures exist that assess dimensions of spirituality and religiosity in health, theological and social settings. In this review, we aim to identify and evaluate measures assessing factors relating to spirituality and religiosity in clinical settings. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases with search terms relating to spirituality, religiosity that also included well-being, needs, distress and beliefs used in self-reporting and clinician-administered measures. Only articles relating to the validation and subsequent administration of measures used in clinical settings were eligible for review. Results: Of 75 measures selected for initial screening, 25 had been validated and used in clinical settings and were reviewed for this study. Most measures were validated in oncological and palliative care settings where the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-Sp12) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Spiritual, Religious and Personal Beliefs (WHOQOL-SRPB) were most validated and frequently used. Only six measures were found that assessed spiritual distress and/or the needs of which only two had been investigated more than twice. Two measures assessing spirituality and religious beliefs in healthcare staff were also reviewed. Conclusions: This review provides a current summary of measures evaluating several dimensions of spirituality and religiosity used in clinical settings. Currently there is a lack of reliable measures evaluating spiritual needs and distress.

AB  - BackgroundSmall groups are used to promote health, well-being, and personal change by altering members' perceptions, beliefs, expectations, and behaviour patterns. An extensive cross-disciplinary literature has articulated and tested theories explaining how such groups develop, function, and facilitate change. Yet these theoretical understandings are rarely applied in the development, description, and evaluation of health-promotion, group-based, behaviour-change interventions.
   MethodsMedline database, library catalogues, search engines, specific journals and reference lists were searched for relevant texts. Texts were reviewed for explanatory concepts or theories describing change processes in groups, which were integrated into the developing conceptual structure. This was designed to be a parsimonious conceptual framework that could be applied to design and delivery.
   ResultsFive categories of interacting processes and concepts were identified and defined: (1) group development processes, (2) dynamic group processes, (3) social change processes, (4) personal change processes, and (5) group design and operating parameters. Each of these categories encompasses a variety of theorised mechanisms explaining individual change in small groups.
   ConclusionThe final conceptual model, together with the design issues and practical recommendations derived from it, provides a practical basis for linking research and theory explaining group functioning to optimal design of group-based, behaviour-change interventions.

AB  - Eczema is a chronic atopic disease that is highly prevalent among children worldwide. Identification of factors that may contribute to childhood eczema is needed in order to develop strategies in its prevention. Over the past decade, accumulating evidence has suggested a potential correlation between the experience of stress by mothers and the risk of eczema development in their child. The present review attempts to provide an overview of the studies that contribute data on this correlation. The literature search was conducted using five databases, resulting in the inclusion of eleven studies in the review. The findings of these studies were summarized narratively. Further, an appraisal of the reporting quality of the included studies was conducted using a twelve-item checklist adapted from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Overall, the included studies showed that a positive correlation exists between the experience of stress among mothers and eczema risk of their child. The findings highlight the importance of the implementation of stress reduction programs for pregnant women and those in their postpartum period within communities in order to enable these individuals to relieve stress effectively.

   Evidence Acquisition: Based on a bibliographic search of Pub Med, we identified, using keywords, all the clinical studies up to 2015 conducted on the oral health of patients with schizophrenia
   Results: From 81 articles chosen, we retained 23 clinical studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies find higher dental and periodontal indexes in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population. Access to healthcare is a problem for these patients. The level of research is insufficiently considered compared to other chronic pathologies. Many factors contribute to poor oral health in these patients such as their mental illness, side effects of psychotropic drugs, and any psychosocial factors they might encounter.
   Conclusions: For these fragile patients with specific needs, simple measures can be implemented to improve their oral health. Better taken into account, the oral health of these patients should contribute to the overall improvement of quality of life and to the general health of these subjects.

AB  - Background. Current literature shows that posttraumatic stress disorder and complex posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms differ. Although the psychological treatments available for posttraumatic disorder are well established, little is known about the effectiveness of those aimed at the treatment of complex posttraumatic stress. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of psychological treatments for complex posttraumatic stress disorder. Method. A systematic qualitative search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, searching four psychological and health electronic databases: Medline, Pilots, PsycINFO, and Pubmed. Three reviewers independently selected the studies in two phases: preselection (criteria for complex posttraumatic stress disorder, replicable psychological treatment, and treatment effect) and selection (additional criteria: type of study, participants, and treatment). Results. Of the 615 studies reviewed, 25 were preselected, eight of which met the inclusion and methodological quality criteria. Five studies explored adult populations (with one exception, all were randomized clinical trials) and three child populations (clinical studies with pre-post-treatment design, with and without control group). Most studies with adult populations included psychoeducation, cognitive re-structuration, and exposure therapy. The studies with child samples included EMDR and mindfulness as the most frequent treatment components. Discussion and conclusion. The evidence was insufficient to determine the most effective treatment. More research on this issue is required.

AB  - Food, energy, and water (FEW) systems are inexorably linked. Earth's changing climate and increasing competition for finite land resources are creating and amplifying challenges at the FEW nexus. Managing FEW systems to mitigate these negative impacts and stresses is a pressing policy issue. The FEW interface is often managed as three independent systems, missing disruptive opportunities for streamlined integrated management. We contend that existing technologies can be reframed and emerging technologies can be harnessed for integrated FEW management, changing the way that each resource system operates within the broader system. We discuss solutions to three main challenges to integrating FEW system management: resolving spatiotemporal disconnections over multiple scales; closing resource loops; and creating actionable information. Sustainable resource management is critical for humanity, as well as for functioning trade systems and ecological health. Embracing integrated management in FEW systems would enable policy makers and managers to more efficiently and effectively secure critical resource systems in the face of global change.

AB  - Purpose of Review Psychiatric practice continues to evolve and play an important role in patients' lives, the field of medicine, and health care delivery. Clinicians must learn a variety of clinical care systems and lifelong learning (LLL) is crucial to apply knowledge, develop skills, and adjust attitudes. Technology is rapidly becoming a key player-in delivery, lifelong learning, and education/training.
   Recent Findings The evidence base for telepsychiatry/telemental health via videoconferencing has been growing for three decades, but a greater array of technologies have emerged in the last decade (e.g., social media/networking, text, apps). Clinicians are combining telepsychiatry and these technologies frequently and they need to reflect on, learn more about, and develop skills for these technologies. The digital age has solidified the role of technology in continuing medical education and day-to-day practice.
   Summary Other fields of medicine are also adapting to the digital age, as are graduate and undergraduate medical education and many allied mental health organizations. In the future, there will be more online training, simulation, and/or interactive electronic examinations, perhaps on a monthly cycle rather than a quasi-annual or 10-year cycle of recertification.

AB  - Recent evidence has suggested that psychosis could develop not only in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) but also in those with clinical risk syndromes for emergent nonpsychotic mental disorders. The proportion of people with these clinical risk syndromes who will develop psychosis rather than to other nonpsychotic mental disorders is undetermined. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting on clinical risk syndromes for the development of emergent nonpsychotic mental disorders. Incidence of emerging psychotic and nonpsychotic mental disorders defined on the ICD or DSM. Of a total of 9 studies relating to 3006 nonpsychotic at-risk individuals were included. Within prospective studies (n = 4, sample = 1051), the pooled incidence of new psychotic disorders across these clinical risk syndromes was of 12.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 4.3 to 38.6) and that of nonpsychotic disorders (n = 3, sample = 538) was of 43.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 30.9 to 61.3). Psychotic disorders may emerge outside the CHR-P paradigm, from clinical risk syndromes for incident nonpsychotic disorders, albeit at lower rates than in the CHR-P group. The clinical risk syndromes for emerging nonpsychotic disorders may exhibit a pluripotential risk of developing several types of mental disorders compared with CHR-P. If substantiated by future research, the current findings suggest that it may be useful to move beyond the current strategy of identifying individuals meeting CHR-P criteria only.

AB  - Background: Death following self-harm constitutes a major global public health challenge and there is an urgent need for governments to implement cost-effective, national suicide prevention strategies. Aim: To conduct a systematic review and quality appraisal of the economic evaluations of interventions aimed at preventing suicidal behavior. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in several literature databases to identify relevant articles published from 2003 to 2016. Drummond's 10-item appraisal tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: In total, 25 documents encompassing 30 economic evaluations were included in the review. Of the identified evaluations, 10 studies were found to be of poor quality, 14 were of average quality, and six studies were considered of good quality. The majority of evaluations found the interventions to be cost-effective. Limitations: Several limitations were identified and discussed in the article. Conclusion: A notable few economic evaluations were identified. The studies were diverse, primarily set in high-income countries, and often based on modeling, emphasizing the need for more primary research into the topic. The discussion of suicide and self-harm prevention should be as nuanced as possible, including health economics along with cultural, social, and political aspects.

AB  - This systematic review assesses the association between prenatal antidepressant exposure and risk of ADHD in children. Electronic databases were searched up to 25 July 2017. Observational studies examining this association were included in the review and meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. Eight relevant studies were identified. The seven studies included in the meta-analysis comprised a total of 2,886,502 children. The pooled estimates comparing prenatal exposure to non-exposure showed an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 1.39 (95%CI 1.21-1.61). Similarly, an increased risk was found comparing previous antidepressant users and nonusers: aRR = 1.56 (95%CI 1.25-1.95). The relationship between maternal psychiatric conditions and ADHD in children yielded an aRR of 1.90 (95%CI 1.47-2.45). Three studies conducted sibling-matched analyses with aRR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.75-1.16). These data suggest that the observed association between prenatal use of antidepressants and risk of ADHD in offspring can be partially explained by confounding by indication because the results from sibling-matched analyses do not support an increased risk of ADHD in discordant exposed siblings.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is associated with increased physical morbidity and early mortality, suggesting that the aging process may be accelerated in schizophrenia. However, the biological underpinnings of these alterations in aging in schizophrenia are unclear. Method: We conducted a detailed search of peer-reviewed empirical studies to evaluate evidence for accelerated biological aging in schizophrenia based on systemic, age-related biomarkers. We included studies that investigated differences between persons with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects in levels of biomarkers known to be associated with aging and examined the relationship of these biomarkers to age in the 2 groups. Results: Forty-two articles that met our selection criteria were reviewed. Nearly 75% reported abnormal biomarker levels among individuals with schizophrenia, including indices of inflammation, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, metabolic health, gene expression, and receptor/synaptic function, with medium to large effect sizes reported in many studies. Twenty-nine percent of the studies observed differential age-related decline in schizophrenia. Markers of receptor/synaptic function and gene expression were most frequently differentially related to age in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients with greater disease severity and longer illness duration exhibited higher levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and shorter telomere length. Conclusions: Most studies show biomarker abnormalities in schizophrenia, and there is some suggestion for accelerated aging. Although definitive interpretation is limited by cross-sectional design of the published reports, findings in the area of gene expression and synaptic function are promising and pave the way for future longitudinal studies needed to fully test this hypothesis.

KW  - drug interactions
KW  - safety
AB  - Background: Lithium is often used in bipolar disorder and occasionally in unipolar depression. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics are frequently prescribed and their interaction with lithium is based mainly in few small studies. Objectives: Conduct a review, identify different interaction patterns and discuss treatment options. Methods: Three searches were made in PubMed in January 2016: 1) using the keywords "lithium" [and] "non-steroidal anti-inflammatory"; 2) using the keywords "lithium" [and] "diuretics" and the filter "title/abstract"; 3) using the terms "lithium" [and] "toxicity" and the filters "title" [and] "review". From the 293 remaining articles, 10 were selected. Another search in Scielo. org was made, using the term "litio" and the filter "Psiquiatria". Two articles were selected from the initial 53. Six textbooks were added to expand the evidence, achieving a total of 18 references. Results: The majority of NSAIDs and diuretics rises lithium levels, specially thiazides. However, some show great variability or no interaction at all, and others even decrease lithium levels. Discussion: Lower-doses, shorter durations, lithium adjustments and levels' follow-ups are recommended, especially in elderly and multiple co-morbid patients.

AB  - Unmasking of latent neurodegenerative disease has been reported following exposure to chemicals that share one or more mechanisms of action in common with those implicated in the specific disease. For example, unmasking of latent Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with exposure to anti-dopaminergic agents, while the progression of pre-existing mild cognitive impairment and unmasking of latent Alzheimer's disease has been associated with exposure to general anesthetic agents which promote A protein aggregation. This literature review and clinical case report about a 45-year-old man with no family history of motor neuron disease who developed overt symptoms of a neuromuscular disorder in close temporal association with his unwitting occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) puts forth the hypothesis that exposure to VOCs such as toluene, which disrupt motor function and increase oxidative stress, can unmask latent ALS type neuromuscular disorder in susceptible individuals.

AB  - Fisheries currently represent the main source of animal protein intake worldwide, although catches of most commercial species are at or beyond maximum sustainable yields. Increasing production would require an excess of exploitation levels and aquaculture is expected to become crucial in sustaining a growing seafood demand. Nonetheless, many threats are expected to affect aquaculture and the increased production must evolve in a way that minimizes environmental and socio-economic impacts. The claimed sustainable development of human activities at sea (blue growth and economy) seeks for new joint analyses and solutions at (trans-)national systemic level should be planned and applied. To meet a sustainable development, both production and management approaches should evolve. Here we propose a conceptual framework to integrate a "downscaling approach" based on functional features of cultivated organisms to accommodate multiple stressors in setting sustainable development standards to design adaptive solutions fitting with the management of marine space.

AB  - Frequent visitors at the psychiatric emergency room (PER) constitute a small subgroup of patients, yet they are responsible for a disproportionate number of visits and thus claim considerable resources. Their needs are often left unmet and their repetitive visits reflect their dissatisfaction as well as that of PERs' staff. Motivated by these dilemmas, this study systematically reviews the literature about frequent visitors at PER and seeks to answer two questions: What characterizes frequent visitors at PER in the literature? and What characterizes PER in the literature? Based on 29 studies, this paper offers answers to the two questions based on a strength weakness opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis. The results of the review and subsequent analysis of the literature revealed the multiplicity and complexity of frequent visitors' characteristics and how they appear to converge. Commonalities were more difficult to identify in PER characteristics. In some cases, this happened because the characteristics were poorly described or were context specific. As a result, it was not easy to compare the studies on PER. Based on SWOT and the findings of the analysis, the paper proposes new venues of research and suggests how the field of mental health might develop by taking into account its opportunities and threats.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic and progressive disorders that affect specific regions of the brain, causing gradual disability and suffering that results in a complete inability of patients to perform daily functions. Amyloid aggregation of specific proteins is the most common biological event that is responsible for neuronal death and neurodegeneration in various neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic agents capable of interfering with the abnormal aggregation are required, but traditional drug discovery has fallen short. The exploration of new uses for approved drugs provides a useful alternative to fill the gap between the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and the long-term assessment of classical drug discovery technologies. Drug re-profiling is currently the quickest possible transition from bench to bedside. In this way, experimental evidence shows that some antibiotic compounds exert neuroprotective action through anti-aggregating activity on disease-associated proteins. The finding that many antibiotics can cross the blood-brain barrier and have been used for several decades without serious toxic effects makes them excellent candidates for therapeutic switching towards neurological disorders. The present review is, to our knowledge, the first extensive evaluation and analysis of the anti-amyloidogenic effect of different antibiotics on well-known disease-associated proteins. In addition, we propose a common structural signature derived from the antiaggregant antibiotic molecules that could be relevant to rational drug discovery. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mentally disordered offenders may be sent to secure psychiatric hospitals. These settings can resemble carceral spaces, employing high levels of security restricting resident autonomy, expression and social interaction. However, research exploring the restrictiveness of forensic settings is sparse. A systematic review was therefore undertaken to conceptualize this restrictiveness. Eight databases were searched for papers that address restrictive elements of secure forensic care in a non-cursory way. Fifty sources (empirical articles and policy documents) were included and subject to thematic analysis to identify 1) antecedent conditions to, 2) characteristic attributes, 3) consequences and 4) 'deviant' cases of the developing concept.
   The restrictiveness of forensic care was experienced across three levels: individual, institutional and systemic. Restrictiveness was subjective and included such disparate elements as limited leave and grounds access, ownership of personal belongings and staff attitudes. The manner and extent to which these are experienced as restrictive was influenced by two antecedent conditions; whether the purpose of forensic care was to be more caring or custodial and the extent to which residents were perceived to be risky. We argue that there must be a reflexivity from stakeholders between the level of restrictiveness needed to safely provide care in a therapeutic milieu and enable the maximum amount of resident autonomy.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Self-injurious behaviour (SIB) is a devastating condition frequently encountered in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) that can lead to dangerous tissue injury and profound psychosocial difficulty. An increasing number of reports over the past decade have demonstrated the swift and well tolerated resolution of intractable SIB with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) when psychopharmacological and behavioural interventions are ineffective. The current article provides a review of the salient literature, including the conceptualization of repetitive self-injury along the catatonia spectrum, and further clarifies the critical distinction between ECT and contingent electric shock.
   Recent findings
   We searched electronically for literature regarding ECT for self-injurious behaviour from 1982 to present, as the first known report was published in 1982. Eleven reports were identified that presented ECT in the resolution of self-injury in autistic or intellectually disabled patients, and another five reports discussed such in typically developing individuals. These reports and related literature present such self-injury along the spectrum of agitated catatonia, with subsequent implications for ECT.
   Summary
   Intractable self-injury remains a significant challenge in ASDs, especially when patients do not respond adequately to behavioural and psychopharmacological interventions. ECT is well tolerated and efficacious treatment for catatonia, and can confer marked reduction in SIB along the agitated catatonia spectrum.

AB  - Background The majority of liver transplant recipients survive long term after the procedure.
   Aim To assess if this positive outcome is associated with improved employment post-transplant.
   Methods A systematic review of publications between 2001 and 2016 was performed. A standard procedure was used to search for suitable publications from two databases (PubMed and EMBASE). Duplicates were removed and abstracts screened by both authors for possible inclusion. Possible suitable publications were obtained and examined for the presence of pre-and post-employment information. Full articles that had this information were reviewed by standard methodology for assessment of bias.
   Results A total of 162 individual abstracts were screened. Thirty-five full papers were reviewed and 13 papers included in the detailed review. Risk of bias was considered high due to low response rates, poor assessment of prognostic and confounding factors and varying definitions of employment. Heterogeneous data precluded meta-analysis. Eight studies focused on return to work as a primary outcome and five on quality of life with employment as a secondary outcome. Follow-up varied between 2 and 13 years. Rates of employment fell in all studies assessed. Employment rates ranged from 26 to 80% pre-transplant and 18 to 44% post-transplant. The proportion of those categorized as ill-health retired was 24% greater after orthotopic liver transplantation.
   Conclusions Improved survival after liver transplantation was not reflected in a return to employment and retirement was common. Areas for further study include interventions to minimize physical deconditioning, depression associated with lower employment rates and type of work available after transplant.

AB  - Objectives Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare but well-described autoimmune disease, which is sometimes comorbid with psychiatric illness. There have been several case reports describing the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of core psychopathology in the context of MG. We sought to review the available published data on ECT in MG and add another case example to the literature.
   Methods We performed a PubMed search for relevant articles or case reports in English describing ECT in MG and summarized findings.
   Results We identified 7 published cases meeting our inclusion criteria in varying detail with different psychiatric presentations and different anesthetic and ECT technique approaches. In addition, we add our own case.
   Conclusions Based on the literature and our own clinical experience, ECT seems to be a safe option for the treatment of core psychopathology with comorbid MG as long as appropriate precautions are in place, particularly when choosing an anesthetic approach.

AB  - Electrical devices currently used in clinical practice and common household equipments generate extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) that were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as "possible carcinogenic." Assuming that ELF-MF plays a role in the carcinogenic process without inducing direct genomic alterations, ELF-MF may be involved in the promotion or progression of cancers. In particular, ELF-MF-induced responses are suspected to activate redox-responsive intracellular signaling or detoxification scavenging systems. In fact, improved protection against oxidative stress and redox-active xenobiotics is thought to provide critical proliferative and survival advantage in tumors. On this basis, an ever-growing research activity worldwide is attempting to establish whether tumor cells may develop multidrug resistance through the activation of essential cytoprotective networks in the presence of ELF fields, and how this might trigger relevant changes in tumor phenotype. This review builds a framework around how the activity of redox-responsive mediators may be controlled by co-exposure to ELF-MF and reactive oxygen species-generating agents in tumor and cancer cells, in order to clarify whether and how such potential molecular targets could help to minimize or neutralize the functional interaction between ELF-MF and malignancies.

AB  - Background: Treatment of offenders in forensic mental health is complex. Often, these in- or outpatients have low treatment motivation, suffer from multiple disorders, and have poor literacy skills. eHealth may be able to improve treatment outcomes because of its potential to increase motivation and engagement, and it can overcome the predominant one-size-fits-all approach by being tailored to individual patients.
   Objective: To examine its potential, this systematic review studies the way that eHealth has been used and studied in forensic mental health and identifies accompanying advantages and disadvantages for both patients and treatment, including effectiveness.
   Methods: A systematic search in Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was performed up until December 2017. Studies were included if they focused on technological interventions to improve the treatment of forensic psychiatric patients.
   Results: The search resulted in 50 studies in which eHealth was used for treatment purposes. Multiple types of studies and technologies were identified, such as virtual reality, web-based interventions, and videoconferencing. The results confirmed the benefits of technology, for example, the acquisition of unique information about offenders, effectiveness, and tailoring to specific characteristics, but indicated that these are not fully taken advantage of.
   Discussion: To overcome the barriers and obtain the benefits, eHealth has to have a good fit with patients and the forensic psychiatric context. It has to be seamlessly integrated in existing care and should not be added as an isolated element. To bridge the gap between the current situation and eHealth's potential, further research on development, implementation, and evaluation should be conducted.

AB  - Background: The need for optimal study designs in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research is increasingly recognized. Despite the wide range of study designs available for D&I research, we lack understanding of the types of designs and methodologies that are routinely used in the field. This review assesses the designs and methodologies in recently proposed D&I studies and provides resources to guide design decisions.
   Methods: We reviewed 404 study protocols published in the journal Implementation Science from 2/2006 to 9/2017. Eligible studies tested the efficacy or effectiveness of D&I strategies (i.e., not effectiveness of the underlying clinical or public health intervention); had a comparison by group and/or time; and used >= 1 quantitative measure. Several design elements were extracted: design category (e.g., randomized); design type [e.g., cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)]; data type (e.g., quantitative); D&I theoretical framework; levels of treatment assignment, intervention, and measurement; and country in which the research was conducted. Each protocol was double-coded, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
   Results: Of the 404 protocols reviewed, 212 (52%) studies tested one or more implementation strategy across 208 manuscripts, therefore meeting inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, 77% utilized randomized designs, primarily cluster RCTs. The use of alternative designs (e.g., stepped wedge) increased over time. Fewer studies were quasi-experimental (17%) or observational (6%). Many study design categories (e.g., controlled pre post, matched pair cluster design) were represented by only one or two studies. Most articles proposed quantitative and qualitative methods (61%), with the remaining 39% proposing only quantitative. Half of protocols (52%) reported using a theoretical framework to guide the study. The four most frequently reported frameworks were Consolidated Framework for Implementing Research and RE-AIM (n = 16 each), followed by Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services and Theoretical Domains Framework (n = 12 each).
   Conclusion: While several novel designs for D&I research have been proposed (e.g., stepped wedge, adaptive designs), the majority of the studies in our sample employed RCT designs. Alternative study designs are increasing in use but may be underutilized for a variety of reasons, including preference of funders or lack of awareness of these designs. Promisingly, the prevalent use of quantitative and qualitative methods together reflects methodological innovation in newer D&I research.

AB  - Freezing of gait (FOG) is a gait disorder featured by recurrent episodes of temporary gait halting and mainly found in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). FOG has a severe impact on the quality of life of patients with PD. The pathogenesis of FOG is unclear and considered to be related to several brain areas and neural circuits. Its close connection with cognitive disorder has been proposed and some researchers explain the pathogenesis using the cognitive model theory. FOG occurs concurrently with cognitive disorder in some PD patients, who are poorly responsive to medication therapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) proves effective for FOG in PD patients. Cognitive impairment plays a role in the formation of FOG. Therefore, if DBS works by improving the cognitive function, both two challenging conditions can be ameliorated by DBS. We reviewed the clinical studies related to DBS for FOG in PD patients over the past decade. In spite of the varying stimulation parameters used in different studies, DBS of either subthalamic nucleus (STN) or pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) alone or in combination can improve the symptoms of FOG. Moreover, the treatment efficacy can last for 1-2 years and DBS is generally safe. Although few studies have been conducted concerning the use of DBS for cognitive disorder in FOG patients, the existing studies seem to indicate that PPN is a potential therapeutic target to both FOG and cognitive disorder. However, most of the studies have a small sample size and involve sporadic cases, so it remains uncertain which nucleus is the optimal target of stimulation. Prospective clinical trials with a larger sample size are needed to systematically assess the efficacy of DBS for FOG and cognitive disorder.

AB  - Deep-sea tailings disposal (DSTD) and its shallow water counterpart, submarine tailings disposal (STD), are practiced in many areas of the world, whereby mining industries discharge processed mud- and rock-waste slurries (tailings) directly into the marine environment. Pipeline discharges and other land-based sources of marine pollution fall beyond the regulatory scope of the London Convention and the London Protocols (LC/LP). However, guidelines have been developed in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to improve tailings waste management frameworks in which mining companies can operate. DSTD can impact ocean ecosystems in addition to other sources of stress, such as from fishing, pollution, energy extraction, tourism, eutrophication, climate change and, potentially in the future, from deep-seabed mining. Environmental management of DSTD may be most effective when placed in a broader context, drawing expertise, data and lessons from multiple sectors (academia, government, society, industry, and regulators) and engaging with international deep-ocean observing programs, databases and stewardship consortia. Here, the challenges associated with DSTD are identified, along with possible solutions, based on the results of a number of robust scientific studies. Also highlighted are the key issues, trends of improved practice and techniques that could be used if considering DSTD (such as increased precaution if considering submarine canyon locations), likely cumulative impacts, and research needed to address current knowledge gaps.

AB  - Astrocytes have been generally believed to perform mainly homeostatic and supportive functions for neurons in the central nervous system. Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests previously unrecognized and surprising functions for astrocytes, including regulation of synaptic formation, transmission and plasticity, all of which are considered as the infrastructure for information processing and memory formation and stabilization. This review discusses the involvement of astrocytes in memory functions and the possible mechanisms that may underlie it. We review the important breakthroughs obtained in this field, as well as some of the controversies that arose from the past difficulty to manipulate these cells in a cell type-specific and non-invasive manner. Finally, we present new research avenues based on the advanced tools becoming available in recent years: optogenetics and chemogenetics, and the potential ways in which these tools may further illuminate the role of astrocytes in memory processes.

AB  - Adolescent self-harm is an emerging public health challenge. It is associated with later psychiatric and substance use disorders, unemployment and suicide. Family interventions have been effective in a range of adolescent mental health problems and for that reason were reviewed for their effectiveness in the management of adolescent self-harm. The search identified 10 randomised and 2 non-randomised controlled trial conducted in the high-income countries. For the most part the evidence is of low quality. The interventions were classified as brief single session, intermediate-level and intensive family interventions depending on the intensity and duration of treatment. Brief interventions did not reduce adolescent self-harm. Intermediate interventions such as the Resourceful Adolescent Parent Programme, Safe Alternatives for Teens and Youth Programme and attachment-based family treatment were effective in reducing suicidal behaviour (effect size 0.72), suicide attempts (P=0.01) and suicidal ideations (effect size 0.95), respectively in the short-term with an absence of long-term follow-up data. Intensive adolescent interventions such as dialectical behaviour therapy and mentalisation-based therapy reduced suicidal ideation (effect size 0.89) and self-harm (56% vs 83%, P=0.01), respectively. The persistence of effects beyond the intervention end point is not known in many interventions. Early involvement of the family, an evaluation of the risks at the end of an acute crisis episode and a stepped-care model taking into account level of suicide risk and resources available to an adolescent and her/his family are likely to promote better outcomes in adolescents who self-harm.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an overview of three peptides that, by improving synaptic function, enhance learning and memory in laboratory rodents. We summarize their structure, their mechanisms of action, and their effects on synaptic and cognitive function. First we describe FGL, a peptide derived from the neural cell adhesion molecule which improves cognition by the activation of the PKC pathway that triggers an activity-dependent delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapses. Then we describe PTD4-PI3KAc peptide that by activating PI3K signaling pathway it promotes synapse and spine formation and enhances hippocampal dependent memory. Lastly, we describe a new peptide derived from the well-known tumor suppressor PTEN that prevents pathological interactions between PTEN and PDZ proteins at synapses during exposure to Amyloid beta. This action prevents memory deterioration in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Together, this review indicates how learning and memory can be improved by manipulating synaptic function and number through pharmacological treatment with peptides, and it establishes synaptic function as a valid target for cognitive enhancement.

AB  - The communication between G. S Bose and Sigmund Freud is a well-documented fact, and philosophical blend of rich cultural experiences is unique to modification of traditional psychoanalysis in the context of development of psychiatry in West Bengal. The Calcutta lunatic asylum was established at Bhowanipore, and first general hospital psychiatric unit was formed at R. G. Kar Medical College, Calcutta. Prof. Ajita Chakraborty was a pioneer to describe her struggling days in the early career and shared her views with experiences in her autobiography. The volume and quality of research work, especially in the field of epidemiology led by Dr. D. N. Nandi is worth mentioning. A jail had been converted to mental hospital which is the largest in terms of bed strength (n = 350) at Berhampore, Murshidabad district where Kazi Nazrul Islam and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had spent some period as prisoner during British rules. Bankura was the first district in West Bengal to start District Mental Health program. The various nongovernmental organizations are working together in publicuprivate partnership model or indigenous ways in tandem over years for the betterment of mental health services both at institutional and community level.

AB  - Many individuals now seek out product reviews in order to make an informed decision prior to making a purchase. In this study, we investigate consumers' exposure to and content within product reviews about marijuana because of their potential to shape marijuana purchasing decisions. The terms "weed review," "marijuana review," and "cannabis review" were searched on YouTube on June 10-11, 2015; the team viewed and coded the content of 83 product review videos about marijuana. In addition, we surveyed young adult (18-34 years old) current (past month) marijuana users (n = 742) from across the USA online to assess exposure to product reviews about marijuana and associations with socio-demographic characteristics and marijuana use behaviors. In our content analysis of videos, we observed that the reviewers tended to consume marijuana during the video and often shared personal, favorable experiences towards the marijuana they ingested (e.g., became as high as possible or experienced positive effects on physical and mental health). Most videos normalized marijuana use and could be easily accessed by underage youth. About one third (34%) of the survey participants viewed/sought a product review about marijuana in the past 30 days. In a multivariable logistic regression model, living in a state where recreational use is legal or using multiple forms of marijuana was associated with increased odds of viewing/seeking marijuana reviews. Prevention messages should counter product reviews about marijuana that tend to normalize and promote marijuana use given that they are more readily viewed by individuals who are increasingly susceptible to marijuana's potential harms.

AB  - This systematic review assesses the quality of the evidence across individual studies on the effect of environmental noise (road traffic, aircraft, and train and railway noise) on cognition. Quantitative non-experimental studies of the association between environmental noise exposure on child and adult cognitive performance published up to June 2015 were reviewed: no limit was placed on the start date for the search. A total of 34 papers were identified, all of which were of child populations. 82% of the papers were of cross-sectional design, with fewer studies of longitudinal or intervention design. A range of cognitive outcomes were examined. The quality of the evidence across the studies for each individual noise source and cognitive outcome was assessed using an adaptation of GRADE methodology. This review found, given the predominance of cross-sectional studies, that the quality of the evidence across studies ranged from being of moderate quality for an effect for some outcomes, e.g., aircraft noise effects on reading comprehension and on long-term memory, to no effect for other outcomes such as attention and executive function and for some noise sources such as road traffic noise and railway noise. The GRADE evaluation of low quality evidence across studies for some cognitive domains and for some noise sources does not necessarily mean that there are no effects: rather, that more robust and a greater number of studies are required.

AB  - Background: Problem-solving therapy (PST) is one of the best examined types of psychotherapy for adult depression. No recent meta-analysis has examined the effects of PST compared to control groups or to other treatments. We wanted to verify whether PST is effective, whether effects are comparable to those of other treatments, and whether we could identify the possible sources of high heterogeneity that was found in earlier meta-analyses.
   Methods: We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases, including PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and the Cochrane database of randomized trials.
   Results: We included 30 randomized controlled trials on PST (with 3530 patients), in which PST was compared to control conditions, with other therapies, and with pharmacotherapy. We could compare these 30 trials on PST also with 259 trials on other psychotherapies for adult depression. The effect size of PST versus control groups was g = 0.79 (0.57-1.01) with very high heterogeneity (I-2 = 84; 95% CI: 77-88). The effect size from the 9 studies with low risk of bias was g = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.22-0.46) with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 32; 95% CI: 0-68), which is comparable to the effects of other psychotherapies. PST was a little more effective than other therapies in direct comparisons, but that may be explained by the considerable number of studies with researcher allegiance towards PST. In meta-regression analyses of all controlled studies, no significant difference between PST and other therapies was found.
   Conclusion: PST is probably an effective treatment for depression, with effect sizes that are small, but comparable to those found for other psychological treatments of depression. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and offspring morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, its effect on offspring mental and behavioural disorders is unclear. The aim of this study is to provide the best scientific evidence on the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and offspring mental and behavioural problems. We systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, CINAH and PsycINFO databases. A total of 23 studies (11 included in meta-analysis) were identified. Of the 23 studies included in this review, 15 studies found that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had a negative impact for at least one mental or behavioural disorder. The pooled effect of 11 studies included in the meta-analysis showed that preeclampsia was associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia. However, we found inconclusive finding on the effect of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other mental and behavioural disorders. Further high quality, large sample, birth cohort studies are needed to further progress this area of research.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes that threatens all individuals with diabetes, leading to vision loss or blindness if left untreated. It is frequently associated with diabetic macular edema, which can occur at any point during the development of diabetic retinopathy. The key factors known to lead to its development include hyperglycemia, hypertension, and the duration of diabetes. Though the diet is important in the development of diabetes, its role in diabetic retinopathy has not been clearly identified. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify, summarize and interpret the literature on the association between the diet and dietary intakes of specific foods, nutrients, and food groups, and the risk of diabetic retinopathy. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for English-language studies evaluating the association between the dietary intake of individual foods, macro or micronutrients, dietary supplements, and dietary patterns and their association with retinopathy or macular edema. After reviewing potentially relevant abstracts and, when necessary, full texts, we identified 27 relevant studies. Identified studies investigated intakes of fruit, vegetables, fish, milk, carbohydrates, fibre, fat, protein, salt, potassium, vitamins C, D, and E, carotenoids, dietary supplements, green tea and alcohol. Studies suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet and high fruit, vegetable and fish intake may protect against the development of diabetic retinopathy, although the evidence is limited. Studies concerning other aspects of the diet are not in agreement. The role of the diet in the development of diabetic retinopathy is an area that warrants more attention.

AB  - After the World Trade Center attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11), multiple cohorts were developed to monitor the health outcomes of exposure. Respiratory and cancer effects have been covered at length. This current study sought to review the literature on other physical conditions associated with 9/11-exposure. Researchers searched seven databases for literature published in English from 2002 to October 2017, coded, and included articles for health condition outcome, population, 9/11-exposures, and comorbidity. Of the 322 titles and abstracts screened, 30 studies met inclusion criteria, and of these, 28 were from three cohorts: theWorld Trade Center Health Registry, Fire Department of New York, and World Trade Center Health Consortium. Most studies focused on rescue and recovery workers. While many of the findings were consistent across different populations and supported by objective measures, some of the less studied conditions need additional research to substantiate current findings. In the 16 years after 9/11, longitudinal cohorts have been essential in investigating the health consequences of 9/11-exposure. Longitudinal studies will be vital in furthering our understanding of these emerging conditions, as well as treatment effectiveness.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search (2005 to 2016) in five electronic databases was conducted. Pre-2005 studies were identified from the reference lists of previous studies and systematic reviews, which have similar objective to those of this search. Results: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were included, targeting diverse health problems in a number of settings. Few studies included organizational-level interventions. When viewed in relation to the methodological quality and the sufficiency of economic evidence, five of 11 cost-effective occupational safety and health (OSH) interventions appear to be promising. Conclusion: The present systematic review highlights the need for high-quality economic evidence to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of OSH interventions, especially at organizational-level, in all areas of worker health.

AB  - The potential for climate-related spread of infectious diseases through marine systems has been highlighted in several reports. With this review we want to draw attention to less recognized mechanisms behind vector-borne transmission pathways to humans. We have focused on how the immune systems of edible marine shellfish, the blue mussels and Norway lobsters, are affected by climate related environmental stressors. Future ocean acidification (OA) and warming due to climate change constitute a gradually increasing persistent stress with negative trade-off for many organisms. In addition, the stress of recurrent hypoxia, inducing high levels of bioavailable manganese (Mn) is likely to increase in line with climate change. We summarized that OA, hypoxia and elevated levels of Mn did have an overall negative effect on immunity, in some cases also with synergistic effects. On the other hand, moderate increase in temperature seems to have a stimulating effect on antimicrobial activity and may in a future warming scenario counteract the negative effects. However, rising sea surface temperature and climate events causing high land run-off promote the abundance of naturally occurring pathogenic Vibrio and will in addition, bring enteric pathogens which are circulating in society into coastal waters. Moreover, the observed impairments of the immune defense enhance the persistence and occurrence of pathogens in shellfish. This may increase the risk for direct transmission of pathogens to consumers. It is thus essential that in the wake of climate change, sanitary control of coastal waters and seafood must recognize and adapt to the expected alteration of host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Concerns about the potential environmental risks of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are becoming an important issue because of their rapid growth in different fields. ZnO NPs are inevitably released in the environment during the production, transport, use and disposal process. Therefore, it is necessary to understand their toxicities and mode of actions. This review summarizes the toxic effects of ZnO NPs with different properties and exposed conditionS on different species. The mechanisms of ZnO NPs on living organisms could be mainly attributed to one or more of the following aspects: the physical damage of direct contact, the dissolved zinc ions and the ROS-mediated mechanism. This paper systematically reviews the toxic effects of ZnO NPs on organisms and puts forward the existing problems, which are helpful for the safe and efficient use of ZnO NPs, providing the basis for further study of the toxic effects of ZnO NPs and establishing a comprehensive and safe evaluation system.

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched up to June 2017 to collect studies related to AAI conducted in patients with cognitive impairment. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five quasi-randomized controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) involving 413 participants were included. Compared with control groups, AAI groups exhibited significantly fewer behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), especially depression and agitation. In both the short and long term, AAI had beneficial effects on BPSD in cognitive impairment patients. However, no significant improvements were found in daily living activities, quality of life or cognitive score. The present meta-analysis showed that AAI can be effective in reducing BPSD in patients with cognitive impairment.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of dysfunctions in social interaction, communication, and behaviors. Studies have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and in individuals increased the risk of ASD. A genetic polymorphism study has pinpointed that genotype AA/A-allele of GC rs4588 in children is associated with ASD, which encodes the vitamin D binding protein. Translating the mentioned points into clinical practice, several clinical trials have demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation can improve the core symptoms in children with ASD. One paper also showed that possible prophylactic effect for the reoccurrence of ASD by vitamin D supplement during pregnancy and early childhood. Herein, this review aims to address the recent advances in this field and to clarify the possible role of vitamin D in ASD.

AB  - Characterizing the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders is one of the main challenges of the current research in psychiatry. The availability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to directly probe virtually any cortical areas, thus providing a unique way to assess the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons. This article presents a review of studies employing TMS in combination with Motor Evoked Potentials (TMS/MEPs) and high density Electroencephalogram (TMS/hd-EEG) in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Studies were identified by conducting a PubMed search using the following search item: "transcranial magnetic stimulation and (Schizophrenia or OCD or MDD or ADHD)". Studies that utilized TMS/MEP and/or TMS/hd-EEG measures to characterize cortical excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and/or connectivity in psychiatric patients were selected. Across disorders, patients displayed a pattern of reduced cortical inhibition, and to a lesser extent increased excitability, in the motor cortex, which was most consistently established in Schizophrenia. Furthermore, psychiatric patients showed abnormalities in a number of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations, which was most prominent in the prefrontal cortex of Schizophrenia relative to healthy comparison subjects. Overall, results from this review point to significant impairments in cortical excitability, inhibition, and oscillatory activity, especially in frontal areas, in several major psychiatric disorders. Building on these findings, future studies employing TMS-based experimental paradigms may help elucidating the neurobiology of these psychiatric disorders, and may assess the contribution of TMS-related measures in monitoring and possibly maximizing the effectiveness of treatment interventions in psychiatric populations.

AB  - There is irrefutable evidence that routine physical activity or exercise can offer considerable health benefits to individuals living with various mental disorders. However, it is not clear what effect physical activity has on the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. Despite a paucity of evidence, physical activity or exercise has already been recommended by various health organizations for the management of tics. We provide a systematic review of the effects of physical activity or exercise on tic symptomology in individuals with Tourette syndrome. Major electronic databases were searched for all available publications before August 2017. Keywords and MeSH terms included "physical activity" or "exercise" or "exercise therapy" or "physical exertion" or "sports" and "tics" or "tic disorders" or "Tourette." Eight studies were included, the majority of which were case reports. Despite a number of methodological limitations of the included studies, the review points to a trend that the effects of acute physical activity are intensity-dependent, where light intensity may alleviate and vigorous intensity may exacerbate tics. Chronic physical activity, however, appears to reduce the severity of tics even at higher intensity. Several physiological mechanisms may explain the differential effects of acute and chronic physical activity in Tourette syndrome. Future randomized controlled studies should better characterize the effects of different intensities and types of physical activity in Tourette syndrome. (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Although the toxicity of synthetic chemicals at high doses is well known, chronic exposure to low-dose chemical mixtures has only recently been linked to many age-related diseases. However, it is nearly impossible to avoid the exposure to these low-dose chemical mixtures as humans are exposed to a myriad of synthetic chemicals as a part of their daily lives. Therefore, coping with possible harms due to low dose chemical mixtures is challenging. Interestingly, within the range of environmental exposure, disease risk does not increase linearly with increasing dose of chemicals, but often tends to plateau or even decrease with increasing dose. Hormesis, the over-compensation of various adaptive responses through cellular stresses, is one possible mechanism for this non-linearity. Although the hormetic effects of synthetic chemicals or radiation have long been debated in the field of toxicology, the hormesis concept has recently been generalized in the field of molecular biology; similar to responses to synthetic chemicals, mild to moderate intermittent stressors from any source can induce hormetic responses. Examples of stressors are exercise, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, cognitive stimulation, and phytochemicals. Mitohormesis is hormesis induced by such stressors through mitochondrial retrograde signalling including the increased production of mild reactive oxygen species. Xenohormesis is phytochemical-induced hormesis, reflective of a mutualistic relationship between plant and animals. As humans had repeated exposure to all of these stressors during their evolution, the hormetic effects of these health. behaviours may be considered to be evolutionarily adapted. Although hormesis induced by synthetic chemicals occurs in humans, such hormesis may not be recommended to the public due to unresolved issues on safety including the impossibility of control exposure. However, the use of personal health behaviors which enhance mitohormetic- or xenohormetic-stress can be readily incorporated into everyone's daily lives as a practical way to counteract harmful effects of unavoidable low-dose chemical mixtures.

AB  - Purpose: To provide an overview on the magnitude of the impact of schizophrenia on the healthcare system in Europe and to gain a better understanding on the most important factors influencing the variation of costs.
   Methods: Studies reporting costs and healthcare utilization among patients with schizophrenia were searched in MEDLINE (via Scopus), EMBASE (via Scopus) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 19th January 2017.
   Results: Twenty-three studies, from the 1075 references initially identified, were included in this review. The annual cost per patient ranged from (sic)533 in Ukraine to (sic)13,704 in the Netherlands. Notably drug costs contributed to less than 25% of the direct healthcare cost per patient in every country, which might be explained by similar pharmaceutical prices among countries due to the reference pricing system applied in Europe. Inpatient costs were the largest component of health service costs in the majority of the countries. Despite methodological heterogeneity across studies, four major themes could be identified (age, severity of symptoms, continuation of treatment/persistence, hospitalization) that have substantial impact on the costs of schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia represents a substantial cost for the healthcare system in Europe driven by the high cost per patient. Substantial savings could potentially be achieved by increasing investment in the following areas: (1) reducing the number of hospitalizations e.g. by increasing the efficiency of outpatient care; (2) working out interventions targeted at specific symptoms; (3) improving patient persistence and adherence in antipsychotic therapy.

AB  - Salsolinol (1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline) is a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative whose presence in humans was first detected in the urine of Parkinsonian patients on l-DOPA (l-dihydroxyphenylalanine) medication. Thus far, multiple hypotheses regarding its physiological/pathophysiological roles have been proposed, especially related to Parkinson's disease or alcohol addiction. The aim of this review was to outline studies related to salsolinol, with special focus on in vivo and in vitro experimental models. To begin with, the chemical structure of salsolinol together with its biochemical implications and the role in neurotransmission are discussed. Numerous experimental studies are summarized in tables and the most relevant ones are stressed. Finally, the ability of salsolinol to cross the blood-brain barrier and its possible double-faced neurobiological potential are reviewed.

AB  - Through the behavioral descriptions in age-old texts it is obvious that Mental Health problems exist since the existence of Homo Sapiens and humanity, with ever changing norms, contexts, definitions and hence their management. Gujarat state of India is one of the oldest land plateaus existing. It has been inhabited, ruled and governed by many different people, races, kings; and invaded through its longest sea-coast by Dutch, Portuguese, British. Even after freedom of India in 1947, Gujarat emerged as a separate state in 1960 only. The history of Mental Health, before being a separate state, could be summed up in 2 Mental Hospitals started by British governance and 2 very unique institutions. Post NMHP, there has been a tremendous growth in the sector, supported by many leaders in the governance. This is an attempt to review some documented and some gathered information from dependable sources, from pre-independence colonial era, post-independence and post-statehood contemporary period.

AB  - Psychosis is a heterogeneous psychiatric condition for which a multitude of risk and protective factors have been suggested. This umbrella review aimed to classify the strength of evidence for the associations between each factor and psychotic disorders whilst controlling for several biases. The Web of Knowledge database was searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies which examined associations between socio-demographic, parental, perinatal, later factors or antecedents and psychotic disorders, and which included a comparison group of healthy controls, published from 1965 to January 31, 2017. The literature search and data extraction followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The association between each factor and ICD or DSM diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders was graded into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant according to a standardized classification based on: number of psychotic cases, random-effects p value, largest study 95% confidence interval, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction interval, small study effect, and excess significance bias. In order to assess evidence for temporality of association, we also conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to data from prospective studies. Fifty-five meta-analyses or systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review, corresponding to 683 individual studies and 170 putative risk or protective factors for psychotic disorders. Only the ultra-high-risk state for psychosis (odds ratio, OR=9.32, 95% CI: 4.91-17.72) and Black-Caribbean ethnicity in England (OR=4.87, 95% CI: 3.96-6.00) showed convincing evidence of association. Six factors were highly suggestive (ethnic minority in low ethnic density area, second generation immigrants, trait anhedonia, premorbid IQ, minor physical anomalies, and olfactory identification ability), and nine were suggestive (urbanicity, ethnic minority in high ethnic density area, first generation immigrants, North-African immigrants in Europe, winter/spring season of birth in Northern hemisphere, childhood social withdrawal, childhood trauma, Toxoplasma gondii IgG, and non-right handedness). When only prospective studies were considered, the evidence was convincing for ultra-high-risk state and suggestive for urbanicity only. In summary, this umbrella review found several factors to be associated with psychotic disorders with different levels of evidence. These risk or protective factors represent a starting point for further etiopathological research and for the improvement of the prediction of psychosis.

AB  - AimDiagnosing individuals at ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis can improve early access to treatment, and a two-stage model utilizing self-report screening followed by a clinical interview can be accurate and efficient. However, it is currently unclear which screening cut-offs to adopt with different populations.
   MethodsA systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies evaluating the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ) as a preliminary screener for UHR and psychosis was conducted to examine screening effectiveness in different contexts. MedLine, PsycInfo, SCOPUS and ProQuest Dissertations and Abstracts databases were electronically searched, along with a review screen and citation search of key papers. Findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis.
   ResultsIn total, 14 diagnostic accuracy studies and 45 studies using the PQ as a screening tool for UHR and psychosis were included. In all settings, the 3 different versions of the PQ were all found to accurately identify UHR and full psychosis. Higher cut-off points were required in non-help-seeking samples, relative to general help-seeking populations, which in turn were higher than those needed in samples highly enriched with UHR participants.
   ConclusionThe findings support the use of the PQ as a preliminary screening tool for UHR in different settings; however, higher thresholds in lower UHR-prevalence populations are necessary to minimize false positives. Including the distress criteria, rather than just number of symptoms, may improve screening effectiveness. Different thresholds may be appropriate in different contexts depending on the importance of sensitivity vs specificity. Protocol registration: CRD42016033004.

AB  - Over the years, much research has attempted to unpack what drives public responses to water reuse, using a variety of approaches. A large amount of this work was captured by an initial review that covered research undertaken up to the early 2000s (Hartley, 2006). This paper showcases post-millennium evidence and thinking around public responses to water reuse, and highlights the novel insights and shifts in emphasis that have occurred in the field. Our analysis is structured around four broad, and highly interrelated, strands of thinking: 1) work focused on identifying the range of factors that influence public reactions to the concept of water reuse, and broadly looking for associations between different factors; 2) more specific approaches rooted in the socio-psychological modelling techniques; 3) work with a particular focus on understanding the influences of trust, risk perceptions and affective (emotional) reactions; and 4) work utilising social constructivist perspectives and socio-technical systems theory to frame responses to water reuse. Some of the most significant advancements in thinking in this field stem from the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the 'yuck factor' and the role of such pre-cognitive affective reactions. These are deeply entrenched within individuals, but are also linked with wider societal processes and social representations. Work in this area suggests that responses to reuse are situated within an overall process of technological 'legitimation'. These emerging insights should help stimulate some novel thinking around approaches to public engagement for water reuse. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of exercise on cognition in depression as well as the impact of potential moderators and intervention type.
   Method: Controlled and uncontrolled interventional studies that described an exercise intervention and cognitive outcomes in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) were included following a search of Pubmed, Ovid Medline, PsycInfo and Embase from inception to January 2017. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate Hedges' g using a random-effects model. Meta-regression explored the relationships among age, baseline cognition, frequency and duration of exercise, and cognitive outcomes. Subgroup analyses were also conducted according to type and intensity of exercise interventions.
   Results: Of 12 controlled studies and 3 uncontrolled studies that met inclusion criteria, 9 (642 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. No significant effect of exercise was found on global cognition (Hedges' g = 0.08, P = 0.33, I-2 = 0%) or on individual cognitive domains. Meta-regression analyses failed to find significant relationships among participant age, baseline cognition, number of exercise sessions per wk, duration of exercise per wk, total duration of exercise during the intervention, or improvement in global cognition. Interventions combining physical with cognitive activity significantly improved global cognition (P = 0.048), whereas low-intensity interventions were also positive (P = 0.048).
   Conclusions: No impact of physical exercise was found on cognition in MDD overall. However, we found that interventions combining physical and cognitive activities had a positive impact, and that lower-intensity interventions, where adherence was improved, also impacted positively. There remains a lack of high-quality data in this population.

AB  - Background
   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered to be the most effective treatment in severe major depression. The identification of reliable predictors of ECT response could contribute to a more targeted patient selection and consequently increased ECT response rates.
   Aims
   To investigate the predictive value of age, depression severity, psychotic and melancholic features for ECT response and remission in major depression.
   Method A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A literature search identified recent studies that reported on at least one of the potential predictors.
   Results
   Of the 2193 articles screened, 34 have been included for metaanalysis. Presence of psychotic features is a predictor of ECT remission (odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, P = 0.001) and response (OR = 1.69, P < 0.001), as is older age (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.26 for remission and 0.35 for response (P < 0.001)). The severity of depression predicts response (SMD = 0.19, P = 0.001), but not remission. Data on melancholic symptoms were inconclusive.
   Conclusions
   ECT is particularly effective in patients with depression with psychotic features and in elderly people with depression. More research on both biological and clinical predictors is needed to further evaluate the position of ECT in treatment protocols for major depression.

AB  - Target 6.4 of the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deals with the reduction of water scarcity. To monitor progress towards this target, two indicators are used: Indicator 6.4.1 measuring water use efficiency and 6.4.2 measuring the level of water stress (WS). This paper aims to identify whether the currently proposed indicator 6.4.2 considers the different elements that need to be accounted for in a WS indicator. WS indicators compare water use with water availability. We identify seven essential elements: 1) both gross and net water abstraction (or withdrawal) provide important information to understand WS; 2) WS indicators need to incorporate environmental flow requirements (EFR); 3) temporal and 4) spatial disaggregation is required in a WS assessment; 5) both renewable surface water and groundwater resources, including their interaction, need to be accounted for as renewable water availability; 6) alternative available water resources need to be accounted for as well, like fossil groundwater and desalinated water; 7) WS indicators need to account for water storage in reservoirs, water recycling and managed aquifer recharge. Indicator 6.4.2 considers many of these elements, but there is need for improvement. It is recommended that WS is measured based on net abstraction as well, in addition to currently only measuring WS based on gross abstraction. It does incorporate EFR. Temporal and spatial disaggregation is indeed defined as a goal in more advanced monitoring levels, in which it is also called for a differentiation between surface and groundwater resources. However, regarding element 6 and 7 there are some shortcomings for which we provide recommendations. In addition, indicator 6.4.2 is only one indicator, which monitors blue WS, but does not give information on green or green-blue water scarcity or on water quality. Within the SDG indicator framework, some of these topics are covered with other indicators. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that occurred in the northeast of Brazil in 2015 led to alarming numbers of babies born with microcephaly in this region. Since then, several studies have evaluated the relationship between ZIKV infection and development of the malformation although the specific mechanistic interaction between ZIKV and human physiological processes that ultimately manifest as microcephaly remains debated. Importantly, most current studies did not consider the specificities of the biology and life cycle of ZIKV. As a consequence, specificities of the infection on the developing central nervous system (CNS) were frequently disregarded. In order to begin to address this important gap in our knowledge, we have collated and critically reviewed the existing evidence in this area to identify any emerging consensus on this topic and thereafter describe possible mechanisms by which ZIKV infection could interfere with specific processes of CNS development, such as neuronal proliferation, and the complex interactions of immature neurons with radial glial cells. With this, we were able to present the current knowledge on this important topic in the neurobiology field.

AB  - Previous spirituality studies have mostly been conducted in a Western context (Moberg 2002; Koenig et al. 2012). However, an increasing number of studies are originating from Middle Eastern countries (Koenig et al. 2012). There is a need to review the current status of Middle Eastern research to identify priorities for future research. A search was conducted in two electronic databases: CINAHL and Medline. A final sample of 28 articles was included in the review. Eighteen articles reported on quantitative studies and ten reported on qualitative studies. The majority of previous research has been conducted in Iran (n = 16) and Jordan (n = 6). A total of 3096 participants were included in the studies ranging from 2004 to 2017. Two studies were randomised controlled trials. Most of the qualitative studies aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the concept of spirituality from a Muslim-Arabic perspective. Qualitative findings have conceptualised spirituality as meaning in life, connection, peace and transcendence. In conclusion, there are both differences and similarities between Middle Eastern and Western research on spiritualty and health. Further exploration is warranted to include comparative studies between patient and nurse populations in Western societies and in the Middle East.

AB  - Objectives: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-pharmacological treatment that is effective in treating severe and treatment-resistant depression. Although the efficacy of ECT has been demonstrated to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), the brain mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Structural-functional changes occur with the use of ECT as a treatment for depression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For this reason, we have tried to identify the changes that were identified by MRI to try to clarify some operating mechanisms of ECT. We focus to brain changes on MRI [structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imging (DTI)] after ECT.
   Methods: A systematic search of the international literature was performed using the bibliographic search engines PubMed and Embase. The research focused on papers published up to 30 September 2015. The following Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms were used: electroconvulsive therapy AND (MRI OR fMRI OR DTI). Papers published in English were included. Four authors searched the database using a predefined strategy to identify potentially eligible studies.
   Results: There were structural changes according to the sMRI performed before and after ECT treatment. These changes do not seem to be entirely due to oedema. This investigation assessed the functional network connectivity associated with the ECT response in MDD. ECT response reverses the relationship from negative to positive between the two pairs of networks.
   Conclusion: We found structural-functional changes in MRI post-ECT. Because of the currently limited MRI data on ECT in the literature, it is necessary to conduct further investigations using other MRI technology.

AB  - The body's internal timekeeping system is an under-recognized but highly influential force in behaviors and emotions including anger and reactive aggression. Predictable cycles or rhythms in behavior are expressed on several different time scales such as circadian (circa diem, or approximately 24-h rhythms) and infradian (exceeding 24 h, such as monthly or seasonal cycles). The circadian timekeeping system underlying rhythmic behaviors in mammals is constituted by a network of clocks distributed throughout the brain and body, the activity of which synchronizes to a central pacemaker, or master clock. Our daily experiences with the external environment including social activity strongly influence the exact timing of this network. In the present review, we examine evidence from a number of species and propose that anger and reactive aggression interact in multiple ways with circadian clocks. Specifically, we argue that: (i) there are predictable rhythms in the expression of aggression and anger; (ii) disruptions of the normal functioning of the circadian system increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviors; and (iii) conversely, chronic expression of anger can disrupt normal rhythmic cycles of physiological activities and create conditions for pathologies such as cardiovascular disease to develop. Taken together, these observations suggest that a comprehensive perspective on anger and reactive aggression must incorporate an understanding of the role of the circadian timing system in these intense affective states.

AB  - Background: Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) and other adverse metabolic effects represent serious side effects faced by many patients with psychosis that can lead to numerous comorbidities and which reduce the lifespan. While the pathophysiology of AIWG remains poorly understood, numerous studies have reported a positive association between AIWG and the therapeutic benefit of antipsychotic medications.
   Objectives: To review the literature to (1) determine if AIWG is consistently associated with therapeutic benefit and (2) investigate which variables may mediate such an association.
   Data Sources: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles containing all the following exploded MESH terms: schizophrenia [AND] antipsychotic agents/neuroleptics [AND] (weight gain [OR] lipids [OR] insulin [OR] leptin) [AND] treatment outcome. Results were limited to full-text, English journal articles.
   Results: Our literature search uncovered 31 independent studies which investigated an AIWG-therapeutic benefit association with a total of 6063 enrolled individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or another serious mental illness receiving antipsychotic medications. Twenty-two studies found a positive association while, 10 studies found no association and one study reported a negative association. Study variables including medication compliance, sex, ethnicity, or prior antipsychotic exposure did not appear to consistently affect the AIWG-therapeutic benefit relationship. In contrast, there was some evidence that controlling for baseline BMI/psychopathology, duration of treatment and specific agent studied [i.e., olanzapine (OLZ) or clozapine (CLZ)] strengthened the relationship between AIWG and therapeutic benefit.
   Limitations: There were limitations of the reviewed studies in that many had small sample sizes, and/or were retrospective. The heterogeneity of the studies also made comparisons difficult and publication bias was not controlled for.
   Conclusions: An AIWG-therapeutic benefit association may exist and is most likely to be observed in OLZ and CLZ-treated patients. The clinical meaningfulness of this association remains unclear and weight gain and other metabolic comorbidities should be identified and treated to the same targets as the general population. Further research should continue to explore the links between therapeutic benefit and metabolic health with emphasis on both pre-clinical work and well-designed prospective clinical trials examining metabolic parameters associated, but also occurring independently to AIWG.

AB  - Promoting health behavior change presents an important challenge to theory and research in the field of health psychology. In this paper, we introduce a context-driven approach, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model which is built on Relational Frame Theory. The ACT-based intervention aims to promote individuals' new health behavior patterns through the improvement of the key construct of psychological flexibility, which is defined as the ability to contact the present moment more fully with acceptance and mindfulness as a conscious human being. Building on the psychological flexibility model, implemented through the six core ACT processes, individuals improve maintenance of long term health behavior change through committed acts in service of chosen values while acknowledging and accepting the existence of contrary thoughts, rules, and emotions as part of themselves but not determinant of their behaviors. Taking advantage of this context-driven approach of health behavior change, we recommend researchers and practitioners to design their health behavior change intervention programs based on ACT.

AB  - Recognizing the robust sex differences in schizophrenia prevalence, the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene is a likely candidate for augmentation therapy in this disorder. Therefore, a systematic search was performed using PubMed (Medline), Embase, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of raloxifene in schizophrenia spectrum disorders were included in the quantitative analyses. Outcome measures were psychotic symptom severity, depression, and cognition. Meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. A random-effects model was used to compute overall weighted effect sizes in Hedges' g. Nine studies were included, investigating 561 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Raloxifene was superior to placebo in improving total symptom severity (N = 482; Hedge's g = .57, p = 0.009), as well as positive (N = 561; Hedge's g = 0.32, p = 0.02), negative (N = 561; Hedge's g = 0.40, p = 0.02), and general (N = 526; Hedge's g = 0.46, p = 0.01) subscales, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. No significant effects were found for comorbid depression and cognitive functioning. Altogether, these results confirm the potential of raloxifene augmentation in the treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - Selective degeneration of differentiated neurons in the brain is the unifying feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). A broad spectrum of evidence indicates that initially subtle, but temporally early calcium dysregulation may be central to the selective neuronal vulnerability observed in these slowly progressing, chronic disorders. Moreover, it has long been evident that excitotoxicity and its major toxic effector mechanism, neuronal calcium overload, play a decisive role in the propagation of secondary neuronal death after acute brain injury from trauma or ischemia. Under physiological conditions, neuronal calcium homeostasis is maintained by a fine-tuned interplay between calcium influx and releasing mechanisms (Ca2+-channels), and calcium efflux mechanisms (Ca2+-pumps and-exchangers). Central functional components of the calcium efflux machinery are the Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPases (PMCAs), which represent high-affinity calcium pumps responsible for the ATP-dependent removal of calcium out of the cytosol. Beyond a growing body of experimental evidence, it is their high expression level, their independence of secondary ions or membrane potential, their profound redox regulation and autoregulation, their postsynaptic localization in close proximity to the primary mediators of pathological calcium influx, i.e. NMDA receptors, as well as evolutionary considerations which all suggest a pivotal role of the PMCAs in the etiology of neurodegeneration and make them equally challenging and alluring candidates for drug development. This review aims to summarize the recent literature on the role of PMCAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Multiple factors are involved in the mechanism(s) of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders whilst mitochondria are thought to play a central role in neurodegeneration of Parkinson's disease. Mitochondria are vital to cellular functions by supplying energy in form of ATP and affect cell physiology via calcium, ROS and signalling proteins. Changes in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and ROS overproduction can induce cell death by triggering mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. One of the major triggers for PTP is mitochondria] calcium overload. Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by electrogenic calcium uptake (via Ca2+ uniporter MCU) and efflux (in excitable cells via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX). NCLX inhibition has been described in a familial form of Parkinson's disease where PINK-1 deficiency leads to a delayed calcium efflux and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in response to physiological Ca2+ stimulation. Overexpression of NCLX in PINK-1 deficient neurons not only protects against mitochondrial calcium overload and calcium induced cell death but also restores mitochondrial bioenergetics in these neurons. Mitochondrial NCLX might therefore play an important role in the mechanism(s) of neurodegeneration in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and activation of this exchanger may offer a novel therapeutic target.

AB  - Insights from inherited forms of parkinsonism suggest that insufficient mitophagy may be one etiology of the disease. PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, which helps maintain a healthy mitochondrial network, is initiated by activation of the PINK1 kinase specifically on damaged mitochondria. Recent investigation of this process reveals that import of PINK1 into mitochondria is regulated and yields a stress-sensing mechanism. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of mitochondrial stress-dependent PINK1 activation that is exerted by regulated import of PINK1 into different mitochondrial compartments and how this offers strategies to pharmacologically activate the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

AB  - The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pumps play a critical role in the maintenance of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, crucial for optimal neuronal function and cell survival. Loss of Ca2+ homeostasis is a key precursor in neuronal dysfunction associated with brain aging and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, we review evidence showing age-related changes in the PMCAs in synaptic plasma membranes (SPMs) and lipid raft microdomains isolated from rat brain. Both PMCA activity and protein levels decline progressively with increasing age. However, the loss of activity is disproportionate to the reduction of protein levels suggesting the presence of dysfunctional PMCA molecules in aged brain. PMCA activity is also diminished in post-mortem human brain samples from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients and in cell models of these neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental reduction of the PMCAs not only alter Ca2+ homeostasis but also have diverse effects on neurons such as reduced neuritic network, impaired release of neurotransmitter and increased susceptibility to stressful stimuli, particularly to agents that elevate intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+];. Loss of PMCA is likely to contribute to neuronal dysfunction observed in the aging brain and in the development of age-dependent neurodegenerative disorders. Therapeutic (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) approaches that can enhance PMCA activity and stabilize [Ca2+]; homeostasis may be capable of preventing, slowing, and/or reversing neuronal degeneration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain etiology. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of non-soluble amyloid beta peptides (A beta) in the Central Nervous System (CNS) is the primary cause initiating a pathogenic cascade leading to the complex multilayered pathology and clinical manifestation of the disease. It is, therefore, not surprising that the search for mechanisms underlying cognitive changes observed in AD has focused exclusively on the brain and A beta-inducing synaptic and dendritic loss, oxidative stress, and neuronal death. However, since A beta depositions were found in normal non-demented elderly people and in many other pathological conditions, the amyloid cascade hypothesis was modified to claim that intraneuronal accumulation of soluble A beta oligomers, rather than monomer or insoluble amyloid fibrils, is the first step of a fatal cascade in AD. Since a characteristic reduction of cerebral perfusion and energy metabolism occurs in patients with AD it is suggested that capillary distortions commonly found in AD brain elicit hemodynamic changes that alter the delivery and transport of essential nutrients, particularly glucose and oxygen to neuronal and glial cells. Another important factor in tissue oxygenation is the ability of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC) to transport and deliver oxygen to tissues, which are first of all dependent on the RBC antioxidant and energy metabolism, which finally regulates the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. In the present review, we consider the possibility that metabolic and antioxidant defense alterations in the circulating erythrocyte population can influence oxygen delivery to the brain, and that these changes might be a primary mechanism triggering the glucose metabolism disturbance resulting in neurobiological changes observed in the AD brain, possibly related to impaired cognitive function. We also discuss the possibility of using erythrocyte biochemical aberrations as potential tools that will help identify a risk factor for AD.

AB  - Background: The clinical presentation and risk factors of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in the context of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are poorly understood, and guidance regarding diagnosis and management remains scarce. In this article, we identify case reports of ECT-induced NCSE from literature, and discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these cases in the context of what is known about NCSE from the neurology literature. Methods: A literature search on Pub Med for case reports of NCSE after ECT. Results: We identified 13 cases for this review. Diagnosis in all cases was based on clinical features and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. Clinical presentation was altered mental status or unresponsiveness, with subtle motor phenomena in some cases. All cases had nonspecific risk factors that have been associated with prolonged seizures and convulsions, such as recent discontinuation/reduction of benzodiazepines or anti-convulsants, and concurrent use of antipsychotics and antidepressants. All patients were treated with either benzodiazepines or antiepileptic agents. Outcomes in these post-ECT NCSE cases were generally favorable. Discussion: Although rare, post-ECT NCSE should be kept in mind by physicians when confusion or unresponsiveness develops and continues after ECT,. multilead EEG is gold standard for diagnosis. An intravenous (IV) antiepileptic drug (AED) challenge can help clarify the diagnosis. Initial treatment is recommended with IV benzodiazepines, with a repeat dose if necessary. If seizures persist, IV AEDs are warranted. NCSE refractory to this treatment should be treated with a scheduled IV or oral AED. Serial multilead EEGs should be used to monitor resolution of symptoms. Conclusion: NCSE after ECT is a rare but recognizable clinical event. A high clinical suspicion and low threshold for EEG is necessary for prompt diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose - This critical review of historical and contemporary literature explores the role of television media in the prevalence of stigma towards persons experiencing a mental health challenge. In addition to this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the notion of perceived dangerousness, which is a concept where persons with mental illness are thought by others to be inherently dangerous.
   Design/methodology/approach - A vigorous search of databases was undertaken for articles published between 2000 and 2016. Some seminal literature prior to 2000 was used to compare historical data with current literature. In total, 1,037 publications were reviewed against inclusion criteria.
   Findings - While mental illness stigma has received much attention in the literature, television media and public perceptions of dangerousness have not. While these concepts are complex and multi-factorial, what we do understand is that approaches to address stigma have been largely unsuccessful, and that persons experiencing mental health challenges continue to be significantly disadvantaged.
   Practical implications - Implications to practice for clinicians working in mental health on this issue have not been adequately explored within the literature. While media guidelines assist journalists to make informed choices when they portray mental health issues in television news, there are no such guidelines to inform drama television viewing.
   Originality/value - Significantly, television's role in perpetuation of perceptions of dangerousness has not been adequately explored as a combined co-occurring factor associated with the stigmatisation and avoidance of persons experiencing a mental health challenge. In an era when mental health challenges are on the rise, it is of great importance that we collectively seek to minimise negative impacts and improve the experiences of those with a mental health challenge through addressing stigma both individually and in television media.

AB  - Background: Pornography Use (PU) has been defined as the viewing of explicit materials in the form of pictures and videos, in which people are performing intercourse with clearly exposed and visible genitals. The prevalence of PU has increased dramatically among adolescents, partly attributed to the wide availability of such online material.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic literature review is to map the research interest in the field and to examine whether statistically significant results have emerged from the areas of research focus.
   Methods: To address these aims: a) the PRISMA guidelines are adopted and; b) an integrative conceptualization (derived from the merging of two widely accepted models of understanding of Internet use behaviours) was introduced to guide the synthesis of the findings.
   Results: In total, 57 studies were integrated into the present literature review. Findings were conceptualized/classified into individual, contextual and activity factors related to PU in adolescence. In that context, individual associated factors, such as development, victimization, mental health and religiosity, appear to have primarily captivated research interest demonstrating significant relationships with adolescent PU.
   Conclusion: Results indicate that more research focus on contextual and activity related factors is required to improve the level of understanding of adolescent PU and to inform a more holistic conceptual framework of understanding of the phenomenon during adolescence that could potentially guide future research.

AB  - The search for the universal laws of human brain function is still on-going but progress is being made. Here we describe the novel concepts of connectome harmonics and connectome-harmonic decomposition, which can be used to characterize the brain activity associated with any mental state. We use this new frequency-specific language to describe the brain activity elicited by psilocybin and LSD and find remarkably similar effects in terms of increases in total energy and power, as well as frequency-specific energy changes and repertoire expansion. In addition, we find enhanced signatures of criticality suggesting that the brain dynamics tune toward criticality in both psychedelic elicited states. Overall, our findings provide new evidence for the remarkable ability of psychedelics to change the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain.

AB  - Objectives: Two recent scientific breakthroughs may alter the treatment of mental illness, as discussed in this narrative review. The first was the invention of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which enabled an ongoing, rapid transition to energy-efficient LEDs for lighting, and the use of LEDs to backlight digital devices. The second was the discovery of melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which detect environmental irradiance and mediate non-image forming (NIF) functions including circadian entrainment, melatonin secretion, alertness, sleep regulation and the pupillary light reflex. These two breakthroughs are interrelated because unlike conventional lighting, white LEDs have a dominant spectral wavelength in the blue light range, near the peak sensitivity for the melanopsin system.Methods: Pertinent articles were identified.Results: Blue light exposure may suppress melatonin, increase alertness, and interfere with sleep in young, healthy volunteers and in animals. Areas of concern in mental illness include the influence of blue light on sleep, other circadian-mediated symptoms, prescribed treatments that target the circadian system, measurement using digital apps and devices, and adolescent sensitivity to blue light.Conclusions: While knowledge in both fields is expanding rapidly, future developments must address the potential impact of blue light on NIF functions for healthy individuals and those with mental illness.

A database search was complemented with a web-based search. Both medical subject heading (MESH) terms and free-text search terms were used.Results: Literature from research journals, grey literature, and websites were included. Within this context, recovery does not refer to a cure but involves a process in which a person acts as an agent to develop new goals and meaning in life, despite and beyond limitations posed by the illness and its consequences. A positive focus on recovery is in sharp contrast to historical deterministic and pessimistic concepts of mental illnesses. Recovery-oriented services such as peer support, assertive community treatment, supported employment/education/housing, illness self-management, and decreasing self-stigma are highlighted. A review of 27 measures that focus on personal recovery and promotion of well-being are also discussed.Conclusions: The literature overview presents perspectives and knowledge of how to develop positive psychiatry, how mental health services and their partner organizations may become more recovery oriented and help persons reach well-being and a better quality of life. This study is limited to a narrative review and may precede future systematic reviews.

AB  - Introduction: Older adults with Alzheimer's disease present restrictions on engagement in occupations that may be associated with changes in performance skills. Objective: To identify and analyze the scientific production of Occupational Therapists interventions in the care of older adults with Alzheimer's disease who present changes in performance skills. Method: A systematic review was conducted, in a 10-year period (2006-2015), in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The Web of Science, MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO (R), LILACS, SciELO, OTSeeker, and PEDro databases were used as sources of information. To search, the descriptors "Alzheimer Disease" and "Occupational Therapy" were used, which were combined with "behavior", "environment", "cognition" and "social support", using the boolean operators AND or OR. There were 13 articles identified that met the inclusion criteria selected for deeper analysis: scientific publications related to Alzheimer's disease in older adults, that approach interventions directed to performance skills, with the participation of at least one occupational therapist as an author, and without restrictions on the stage of the disease. Results: No national study was found. The identified interventions are directed toward emotional regulation, motor skills, and procedural skills. In their acting, occupational therapists use route navigation, external aid devices (calendars), computer activities and multisensory stimulation as therapeutic resources that attest the effect of the interventions in motor learning, spatial orientation or in the reduction of neuropsychological symptoms and/or behavioral changes. Conclusion: The publications are related to the intervention practices for the improvement of the older people functional capacity and emotional regulation. However, Brazilian Occupational Therapists face the need to publish interventions to justify the effectiveness of their actions and their insertion in shared professional practice, at the different attention levels to the health of older people.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to delineate the overall theoretical framework on the topic of internet addiction through the comprehensive narrative review to make readers aware of the conceptual growth and development in the respective field. The paper evolves theoretically from the historical foundation, phenomenology, clinical feature, etiological model to the treatment outcome of internet addiction. Multiple studies have been done in the field of mental health but dearth of work given head to toe theoretical overview for understanding of this trendsetter research area in mental health.
   Design/methodology/approach Extensive review of literature has been carried out to make a systematic layout for conceptual paper.
   Findings The internet has been a source of gratification for several behavioral addictions as well as psychiatric disorders. Mainly because of the lack of established diagnostic criteria and a dearth of large sample surveys, the prevalence of problematic internet use (PIU) in general population has not been established. Still, from all the consolidated data, PIU seems to have a male preponderance and manifests itself in late adulthood. Symptoms of PIU can easily be masked with signs of dependence, tolerance and withdrawal which is quite similar to the phenomenology of substance addiction. Psychiatric co-morbidities are more of a norm than the exception in case of PIU. Even though the clinical status of PIU is doubtful, still there is a significant demand for its treatment all over the world. Overall, the excessive use of internet has been strongly debated in literature from PIU to a positive addiction. Only time will tell how it affects our civilization as a phenomenon of evolutionary significance.
   Originality/value The paper is providing a general conceptual framework for internet addiction/PIU to enable readers to know about the topic in depth from the evolution of the concept to the recent developments in the area.

AB  - Introduction: Placebo and nocebo effects form part of all therapeutic environments and play a significant role in the effectiveness of treatment outcomes. Patient expectancies drive these phenomena, which can be shaped through contextual factors including verbal suggestions, conditioning, and social observation.
   Objectives: This review seeks to identify the biopsychosocial factors of the patient-practitioner interaction that play a role in the development of placebo and nocebo effects, as well as the anthropological elements of the biodynamic process of relating that are meaningful in the development of expectancies.
   Methods: We conducted a narrative review of frameworks of the placebo and nocebo effect, including the impact of expectancies and interpersonal relationships in the context of healing and the clinical setting.
   Results: Expectancies leading to placebo and nocebo effects can be modified by macro and micro factors, such as culture and society, as well as individual psychobiological traits, respectively. The developmental sociobiological adaptations that form and consolidate mindsets and meaningful contexts play an important role in shaping patient expectancies, as well as patients' conscious and subconscious reactions to signs and actions taking place within the clinical environment. Practitioner characteristics, like empathy, friendliness, and competence, favor the formation of positive expectancies. Caring and warm patient-practitioner interactions can enhance the therapeutic value of clinical encounters when patients' positive expectancies are actively encouraged and engaged.
   Conclusion: A patient-centered approach rooted in demonstrating care and empathy can positively enhance a patient's experience within the clinical environment and activate psychosociobiological adaptations associated with the placebo phenomenon. Pain patients could particularly benefit from non-invasive approaches for improving treatment effectiveness and quality-of-life.

AB  - Objectives: Elucidating the biological mechanisms involved in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been challenging. Relatively unexplored is the fact that these mechanisms can differ with age.Methods: We present an overview on the major differences between children and adults with ADHD, describing several studies from genomics to metabolomics performed in ADHD children and in adults (cADHD and aADHD, respectively). A systematic search (up until February 2016) was conducted.Results: From a PRISMA flow-chart, a total of 350 and 91 genomics and metabolomics studies were found to be elligible for cADHD and aADHD, respectively. For children, associations were found for genes belonging to dopaminergic (SLC6A3, DRD4 and MAOA) and neurodevelopmental (LPHN3 and DIRAS2) systems and OPRM1 (Yates corrected P=0.016; OR=2.27 95%CI: 1.15-4.47). Studies of adults have implicated circadian rhythms genes, HTR2A, MAOB and a more generic neurodevelopmental/neurite outgrowth network (BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1/NO, KCNIP4 and SPOCK3; Yates corrected P=0.007; OR=3.30 95%CI: 1.33-8.29). In common among cADHD and aADHD, the most significant findings are for oxidative stress proteins (MAD, SOD, PON1, ARES, TOS, TAS and OSI), and, in the second level, DISC1, DBH, DDC, microRNA and adiponectin.Conclusions: Through a convergent functional genomics, this review contributes to clarification of which genetic/biological mechanisms differ with age. The effects of some genes do not change throughout the lifetime, whereas others are linked to age-specific stages. Additional research and further studies are needed to generate firmer conclusions that might someday be useful for predicting the remission and persistence of the disorder. Despite the limitations, some of these genes/proteins could be potential useful biomarkers to discriminate cADHD from aADHD.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Although numerous genetic and environmental factors have been linked to the aetiology of PD the underlying pathobiology remains poorly understood, hampering the development of improved therapies. Transcriptomics has the potential to reveal significant insights into disease processes. In this review, we focused on published transcriptomics studies on PD with the aim of summarizing studies and identifying common biological pathways. A total of 96 articles were identified as follows: 12 meta-analyses, 21 re-analyses of existing data and 63 original studies. Of the 63 original studies, 33 were performed on brain tissue, 26 on blood, three on cerebrospinal fluid and one on skin. In the brain studies, altered pathways identified included those involved in dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, protein degradation, neuroinflammation, vesicular transport and synaptic transmission. Studies on blood samples revealed alterations in pathways involved in immune function, inflammation, RNA processing, protein chaperones, mitochondrial function and programmed cell death. Limitations of these studies include small sample sizes (generally <40 cases/40 controls) and the application of widely varying statistical analysis and parameters. Only eight studies used the RNA-Seq technique. This review highlights the need for harmonization of transcriptomic approaches and the statistical analyses, and for the data to be deposited into publicly available databases in a standardized format for meta-analyses. Notably, the concordance of several pathways such as mitochondrial function, protein degradation and inflammation, identified in both blood and brain tissues, suggests that the disease process is systemic and not restricted to neurological tissues.

AB  - European psychosomatics, as a branch of psychoanalytic psychopathology, has existed for almost two centuries, but it is a constantly moving body of thought. From epistemology to aetiology, its questions are still evolving and concern the debate between the psyche/soma dualism and the monistic alternative, but also the psychic meaning that is to be attributed to somatic symptoms. In France, the discipline has not had its last word, for it is constantly seeking to position itself as a field of research and clinical practice within psychoanalysis. However, it still needs to affirm itself and open itself more towards other branches of knowledge, such as medicine, neuroscience, or the social sciences. In this context, are the processes of somatisation still to be thought of as boundary objects for psychoanalysis? On what epistemological, theoretical, methodological, and practical conditions is the psychosomatic question still or at last possible? In particular, is it possible to reintroduce the question of the meaning of the somatic phenomenon in order to breathe new life into it, without returning, however, to the symbolic interpretation of symptoms, while preserving the subjectivising approach of psychoanalysis and its logic of interpolation? Can we speak in the human sciences of a truly psychosomatic revolution in the image of psychoanalytic advances?

AB  - This paper describes a 9-month project commissioned by Halton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Liverpool photography organisation, Open Eye Gallery. Socially engaged photographers worked with local residents from the Windmill Hill estate in Runcorn to describe healthy and unhealthy aspects of the area. Six women were trained to use cameras to document everyday things that mattered to them. Through focus groups they discussed what these photographs revealed about the health and ill-health of the area. The resulting exhibition, As and When, told their story. Despite being a deprived area with more than average incidence of illness, they identified many positive things that enhanced their sense of wellbeing and resilience. The benefits of the project included increased social engagement and participation, an improved sense of vitality and rejuvenation, emotional benefits, a feeling of greater political agency and increased visual literacy. This paper outlines the model of practice developed with the support of CCG and in collaboration with local stakeholders. It makes a case for the value and the ways in which clusters of general practices could develop links and work with health assets in their local communities.

AB  - Excessive smartphone use has been linked to adverse health outcomes including distracted driving, sleep disorders, and depression. Responding to this growing trend, apps have been developed to support users in overcoming their dependency on smartphones. In that vein, our investigation explored the "big data" available on these types of apps to gain insights about them. We narrowed our search of apps, then reviewed content and functionality of 125 Android and iOS apps that purport to reduce device usage in the United States and elsewhere. This sample was curated based on popularity through the market research tool, App Annie (which indicates revenue and downloads per category of app and by country). The apps fell into 13 broad categories, each of which contained several different features related to filters, usage controls, and monitoring programs. Findings suggest that social media technologies, including smartphone apps, are being attempted for use for health behavior change. We discuss methods of sorting through "big data" generated by apps that purport to curb smartphone addiction. Finally, we propose data-driven features, such as social facilitation and gamification, that developers might use to enhance the effectiveness of these apps.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are a major public health issue throughout the world with devastating effects on patients and families. Sporadic forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are generally thought to develop as a consequence of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences. A number of environmental triggers have been identified in association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We discuss the role of beta-methylamino-l-alanine in the development of neurodegeneration and the potential importance of this neurotoxin as a risk for neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Metformin, a first line antihyperglycemic medication, is an AMPK activator and has been hypothesized to act as a geroprotective agent. Studies on its association with various classifications of age-related cognitive decline have shown mixed results with positive and negative findings.
   Objective: To synthesize the best available evidence on the association of metformin-use with risk, progression, and severity of dementia.
   Method: Eligible research investigated the effect of metformin on dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or any measure of cognitive impairment compared to any control group who were not receiving metformin. The initial search resulted in 862 citations from which 14 studies (seven cohort, four cross-sectional, two RCTs, and one case control) were included.
   Results: Meta-analysis of three studies showed that cognitive impairment was significantly less prevalent in diabetic metformin (Odds ratio = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78), while six studies showed that dementia incidence was also significantly reduced (Hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.88). Mini-Mental State Examination scores were not significantly affected by metformin-use, although both RCTs showed that metformin had a neuroprotective effect compared to placebo. Some studies found negative or neutral effects for metformin use by people with diabetes; the potential mechanism of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency is discussed.
   Conclusions: Metformin should continue to be used as a first line therapy for diabetes in patients at risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The use of metformin by individuals without diabetes for the prevention of dementia is not supported by the available evidence.

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in negative results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which may be due to an increasing placebo response among other factors. Currently, identification and exclusion of placebo responders from trials are attempted to overcome this problem, but so far the success of these approaches has been limited. At the sametime, the placebo-mechanism literature has highlighted how contextual factors, such as patients' expectations, interfere with the effect of drug administration, leading to a certain degree of uncertainty in RCTs. In this chapter, we review the current challenges of RCTs including the uncertainties of the active arm, the placebo arm, the additivity assumption, and the double-blind procedure. We use the placebo-mechanism literature to debate the strengths and weaknesses of attempts to identify and exclude placebo responders from trials. Finally, we illustrate how insights from the placebo-mechanism literature may point to new ways of improving RCTs.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by selective degeneration of neurons primarily in the substantia nigra. At present, the pathogenesis of PD is incompletely understood and there are no neuroprotective treatments available. Accurate animal models of PD provide the opportunity to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. This review focuses on C. elegans models of PD, including both genetic and toxicant models. This microscopic worm offers several advantages for the study of PD including ease of genetic manipulation, ability to complete experiments rapidly, low cost, and ability to perform large scale screens for disease modifiers. A number of C. elegans models of PD have been generated including transgenic worms that express alpha-synuclein or LRRK2, and worms with deletions in PRKN/pdr-1, PINK1/pink-1, DJ-1/djr-1.1/djr-1.2 and ATP13A2/catp-6. These worms have been shown to exhibit multiple phenotypic deficits including the loss of dopamine neurons, disruption of dopamine-dependent behaviors, increased sensitivity to stress, age-dependent aggregation, and deficits in movement. As a result, these phenotypes can be used as outcome measures to gain insight into disease pathogenesis and to identify disease modifiers. In this way, C. elegans can be used as an experimental tool to elucidate mechanisms involved in PD and to find novel therapeutic targets that can subsequently be validated in other models.

AB  - Social cognition includes a range of cognitive processes that help individuals to understand how others think and feel. There is emerging evidence that social cognitive deficits may represent a transdiagnostic issue, potentially serving as a marker of neurological abnormality. We performed an electronic database search in order to identify published, peer-reviewed meta-analyses that compared facial emotion recognition or theory of mind task performance between individuals meeting clinical criteria for a psychiatric, neurological or developmental condition against healthy controls. We identified 31 meta-analyses eligible for inclusion that examined performance across relevant tasks among 30 different clinical populations. The results suggest that social cognitive deficits appear to be a core cognitive phenotype of many clinical conditions. Across the clinical groups, deficits in social cognitive domains were broadly similar in magnitude to those previously reported for more established aspects of cognition, such as memory and executive function. There is a need to clarify the 'real world' impact of these deficits, and to develop effective transdiagnostic interventions for those individuals that are adversely affected.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on eating disorder prevalence in the Nordic countries (i.e. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) between 1994 and 2016. Method: Three online databases, PubMed, PsycINFO and SveMed+, searches were conducted, targeting articles on prevalence, incidence and epidemiology of eating disorders (EDs). The review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and was limited to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) ED diagnoses published between 1994 and 2016. Results: A total of 19 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Results revealed that anorexia nervosa (AN) and binge eating disorder (BED) prevalence ranges in females are lower in the Nordic countries compared to Europe in general, and slightly higher for bulimia nervosa (BN). Discussion: The current review shows that there is an imperative need for studies investigating the prevalence of EDs in the Nordic countries by employing a methodology which allows for a formal diagnosis. The notable lack of two-stage designs in the studies reviewed renders concern regarding the validity of the obtained prevalence rates. It is essential that future studies employ standardized methodologies as these will allow for comparison across geographic regions, genders and ages, facilitating mapping of prevalence rates over time.

AB  - Purpose Beyond budgeting has received an increased amount of scholarly attention in recent years. However, because most of the published research is discrete and unconnected, an overall picture of what is known about beyond budgeting has not evolved. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the available research on beyond budgeting. In particular, the authors compare conceptual papers that mostly stress the benefits of beyond budgeting with empirical evidence on beyond budgeting implementation and offer ideas for future research on beyond budgeting.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses systematic literature review methods. After an extensive database search and examination of references/citations, 32 papers were analysed with regard to bibliographical information, research design and findings.
   Findings Although proponents of beyond budgeting have put substantial effort into developing and promoting this concept, numerous empirical studies demonstrate that many organizations being investigated would still rather improve traditional budgeting than abandon it completely. This review also highlights the main criticisms of traditional budgeting, development of management control systems under beyond budgeting and factors hindering the implementation of beyond budgeting.
   Research limitations/implication This paper suggests that further research is needed on the scaling of beyond budgeting, organizational changes under beyond budgeting and challenges resulting from the implementation of beyond budgeting.
   Originality/value The paper is the first comprehensive literature review on beyond budgeting.

This article recounts my own journey as an author who contributed articles to JAD over the 20 years of the journal's existence. In retrospect, it seems remarkable that a considerable body of work that originated from our group marks a trail that began with studies of vascular, stress, and mitochondrial factors in AD pathogenesis, exploded into the concept of 'Type 3 Diabetes', and continued with the characterization of how environmental, exposure, and lifestyle factors promote neurodegeneration and which therapeutic strategies could reverse the neurodegeneration cascade.

AB  - Severe acquired brain injury (SABI) is damage to the brain, occurring after birth from traumatic or non-traumatic causes, and often resulting in deterioration of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is aimed to help brain-injured or otherwise cognitively impaired individuals to restore normal functioning, or to compensate for cognitive deficits. Over the last years, the development of new technologies in the field of CR has led to a growing use of computer-based cognitive tools in patients with SABI. This review aims to investigate the efficacy of CR in individuals suffering from SABI, and evaluates the role of virtual reality and other innovative technologies in improving behavioural and functional outcomes. The current evidence for CR in the treatment of SABI-related deficits does not allow conclusive results to be achievedand further research is needed to identity the patient and treatment factors that contribute to successful outcomes.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the literature on systemic risk measurement methods. Only the recent global crisis has particularly attracted the attention of researchers on systemic risk measurement. Global challenges such as Big Data, AI, IoF, etc. also have an impact on expanding the systemic risk measurement capabilities. The growing number of publications in the last decade opens the door to deeper insights into the systemic risk measurement features, summarizing the contribution of research and analyse the mainstream research on systemic risk, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the studies. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to provide a framework to address the relevant gaps in the current discussion on systemic risk measurement by conducting a wide search in Scopus database to identify the studies that used different systemic risk measurement in the period from 2009 to January 2018. A meta-analysis of scientific articles is performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and using network approach presents the main interconnection of the methods used to measure systemic risk. A critical analysis of these articles addresses some important key issues. The results of this review are important: they will help researchers to develop better research methods and models around systemic risk measurement. Based on the results, it has allowed us to identify the key issues in choosing a method to assess systemic risk and to help researchers avoid pitfalls in using these methods.

AB  - Background: Child neglect is highly prevalent and associated with a series of biological and social consequences. Early neglect may alter the recognition of emotional faces, but its precise impact remains unclear. We aim to review and analyze data from recent literature about recognition and processing of facial expressions in individuals with history of childhood neglect. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, PsycINFO, ScIELO and EMBASE databases in the search of studies for the past 10 years. Results: In total, 14 studies were selected and critically reviewed. A heterogeneity was detected across methods and sample frames. Results were mixed across studies. Different forms of alterations to perception of facial expressions were found across 12 studies. There was alteration to the recognition and processing of both positive and negative emotions, but for emotional face processing there was predominance in alteration toward negative emotions. Conclusions: This is the first review to examine specifically the effects of early neglect experience as a prevalent condition of child maltreatment. The results of this review are inconclusive due to methodological diversity, implement of distinct instruments and differences in the composition of the samples. Despite these limitations, some studies support our hypothesis that individuals with history of early negligence may present alteration to the ability to perceive face expressions of emotions.

AB  - River watersheds are among the most complex terrestrial features in Alaska, performing valuable ecosystem functions and providing services for human society. Rivers are vital to both estuarine and aquatic biota and play important roles in biogeochemical cycles and physical processes. The functions of watersheds have been used as vulnerability indicators for ecosystem and socioeconomic resilience. Despite a long history of human activity, the Yukon River has not received the holistic and interdisciplinary attention given to the other great American river systems. By using hypothesis-based monitoring of key watershed functions, we can gain insight to regime-shifting stresses such as fire, toxins, and invasive species development. Coupling adaptive risk management practices involving stakeholders with place-based education, especially contaminants and nutrition related, can maintain resilience within communities. The Yukon watershed provides a broadscale opportunity for communities to monitor the environment, manage resources, and contribute to stewardship policy formation. Monitoring keystone species and community activities, such as citizen science, are critical first steps to following changes to resiliency throughout the Yukon watershed. Creating a policy environment that encourages local experimentation and innovation contributes to resilience maintenance during development-imposed stress.

AB  - One of the main functions of astrocytes is to ensure glutamate homeostasis by glutamate uptake and glutamine synthesis. However, during the past ten years it has become clear that astrocytes may also induce changes in synaptic glutamate release when respective pathways must cope with the consequences of brain damage or other alterations in their functional requirements. The loss of glutamatergic synapses in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease is likely to associate with a continuous redistribution of presynaptic activity within the pool of surviving synapses, and astrocytes may have a role in the maintenance of independent control at individual glutamate release sites. The rodent striatum should be a good model structure to analyse astrocyte-synapse interactions underlying disease-related plasticity, because it does not itself contain any glutamatergic neurons. Here we examine recent results that may shed light on the mechanisms underlying pathway-specific alterations in the corticostriatal or thalamostriatal synaptic transmission with a possible involvement of astrocytic release or uptake of glutamate. The conclusions emphasize the need of exploring the highly compartmentalised and presumably heterogeneous synapse astrocyte-interactions at a single synapse level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted of Useful Field of View (UFOV) training, which was evaluated by Institute of Medicine criteria. Forty-four studies of UFOV training from 17 randomized trials conducted among adults were identified in systematic review. Results addressing the Institute of Medicine criteria indicated that: (a) UFOV training enhanced neural outcomes, speed of processing, and attention. (b) UFOV training effects were equivalent when compared to active- or no-contact control conditions. (c) UFOV training showed far transfer to everyday function. (d) Improvements on the trained skills endured across ten years. (e) Half of the clinical trials identified were conducted by researchers without financial interests in UFOV training. Results indicated that UFOV training effects were larger for adaptive- than non-adaptive training techniques, and in community-based as compared to clinical samples. UFOV training did not transfer to other neuropsychological outcomes, but positively enhanced well-being, health, and quality of life longitudinally. Criticisms of cognitive training are addressed. UFOV training should be implemented among older adults to improve real-world functional outcomes and well-being.

AB  - Background: Drug abuse is one of the major concerns of human societies. The relapse of abusing drugs is one of the main targets of addiction therapies. Studies in this regard have introduced four basic mechanisms: 1) drug-induced reinforcement 2) cue-induced reinforcement 3) stress-induced reinforcement and 4) negative reinforcement.
   Objective: In recent studies, cognition has got great interest in addiction research. It has been proposed that prefrontal cortex can reduce the risk of relapse, by influencing cognition. In this review, we are going to discuss the benefit of better cognition in the context of the above four basic mechanisms, not specifically prefrontal cortex.
   Method: A literature search was conducted in all major indexing databases including Pubmed, Em base and Google Scholar. The included articles were not limited to the time of publication and all relevant articles were used.
   Results: Our findings suggest that cognition is necessary for controlling drug abuse. Also, it was found that cognition may control relapse to drug abuse by influencing the four basic mechanisms that are responsible for relapse to drugs.
   Conclusion: Cognition is a necessary factor for controlling drug abuse. It suggested paying special attention to cognition before implementing a plan for treatment of relapse to drug abuse.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and produces a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. The impact of TBI on cognition is among the most important questions in this field but remains incompletely understood. The immediate cognitive effects of concussion, while usually short-lived, may be profound and lasting in some individuals, and long-term sequelae of TBI may include dementia of several varieties including post-traumatic leukoencephalopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Whereas the etiopathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction after TBI remains uncertain, a reasonable point to begin is a focus on the white matter of the brain, where the neuropathological lesion known as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is routinely identified. White matter is not typically accorded the significance granted to cortical gray matter in discussions of cognitive dysfunction and dementia, but increasing evidence is accumulating to suggest that cognitive decline after TBI is a direct result of white matter injury, and that lesions in this brain component are crucial in the sequence of events leading ultimately to dementia of several types. In this review, we consider the topic of white matter and cognition in TBI, beginning with DAI and proceeding to the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction and dementia that can follow. A brief review of possible therapeutic options will also be offered, including the use of anti-inflammatory agents and the exploitation of white matter plasticity, to treat acute and post-acute injuries, and lower the incidence of dementia resulting from TBI.

AB  - Background: This study aims to review the connection between socioeconomic status and schizophrenia and the many ways by which social class of origin contributes to the epidemiology of schizophrenia. For almost a century, numerous studies have reported that the prevalence of schizophrenia varies by social class. A clear majority of these reports uncovered a significantly higher prevalence in the lower class. However, the specific risk factors underlying the connection have not been fully explored.
   Method: One goal of this review is to report the risk factors that have been identified. The second goal is to examine more recent studies about underresearched factors that may also contribute to high risk among the poor. These include prenatal illness, obstetrical complications, family history of the psychosis, stressful life events and early onset. My research team used a unique combination of variables which highlighted symptoms of schizophrenia and social class of origin.
   Results: We consistently found that the combination of lower social class of origin and the risk factors above exacerbate the likelihood of an especially unfavorable outcome.
   Conclusion: The central finding of this review is that being born into poverty not only elevates risk for schizophrenia in general but also for patients to have negative symptomatology.

AB  - Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a noninvasive therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study aimed to update a previous meta-analysis by investigating the acute and longer-term clinical outcomes of DTMS and their possible predictors (patient characteristics and stimulation parameters) in unipolar MDD. A systematic literature search identified 11 studies with 282 treatment-resistant, unipolar MDD patients. The clinical outcomes (depression severity, response and remission rates) were evaluated using random-effects meta-analyses. High frequency and intensity DTMS protocol with H1-coil had significant acute antidepressant outcomes and improved some cognitive functions after 20 daily sessions in unipolar MDD. Response rates tended to increase with lower severity of illness. Antidepressant effects were prolonged if maintenance DTMS was used after daily stimulation phases. DTMS consistently improves various symptom domains (antidepressant, cognitive) in treatment-resistant unipolar MDD.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the mental healthcare system for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Switzerland. It covers the current provision of mental healthcare services as well as educational and research aspects, and summarises both the historical development and the current data on demography, health economics, legislation and national policy.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors performed an extensive literature research and evaluated the (very sparse) literature, conducted some interviews with recognised experts and carried out extensive internet-based research on the topic.
   Findings There are numerous, well-funded, well-staffed and well-equipped facilities for people with ID. These facilities have highly trained special education teachers and social education workers. Legislation, the insurance system as well as the policies and strategies on a national level are basically in line with people's with ID needs. On the other hand, there are too few specialist physicians and psychologists, not enough training centres and too few specialist psychiatric services, both inpatient and outpatient. Medical and psychological research in this field is also insufficient.
   Practical implications In Switzerland, the development of treatment facilities typically does not start with a decision by a central authority to implement a policy in a top-down process. Usually, these organisations develop on the basis of some local initiatives and spread throughout the country. The process is likely to be similar in the case of services for people with mental health and intellectual disabilities (MHID), and the situation can be expected to be much better throughout the country within a few years. Furthermore, specific training programmes are expected to be created for physicians and psychologists of various disciplines, to promote an interdisciplinary approach.
   Originality/value This review fills a gap in that there are very few published reviews on the provision of MHID services in Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: It still remains unclear whether psychotic features increase the risk of suicidal attempts in major depressive disorder. Thus, we attempted, through a systematic review coupled with a meta-analysis, to elucidate further whether unipolar psychotic depression (PMD) compared to non-PMD presents higher levels of suicidal attempts.
   Method: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO as well as in various databases of the so-called gray literature for all studies providing data on suicidal attempts in PMD compared to non-PMD, and the results were then subjected to meta-analysis.
   Results: Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria, including in total 1,275 PMD patients and 5,761 non-PMD patients. An elevated risk for suicide attempt for PMD compared to non-PMD patients was found: The total (lifetime) fixed-effects pooled OR was 2.11 (95% CI: 1.81-2.47), and the fixed-effects pooled OR of the five studies of the acute phase of the disorder was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.33-2.80). This elevated risk of suicidal attempt for PMD patients remained stable across all age groups of adult patients.
   Conclusion: Despite data inconsistency and clinical heterogeneity, this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that patients with PMD are at a two-fold higher risk, both during lifetime and in acute phase, of committing a suicidal attempt than patients with non-PMD.

AB  - Purpose - While individuals with an intellectual disability form a significant minority in the worldwide prison population, their healthcare needs require specialist attention. In Ireland, services for prisoners with intellectual disabilities need development. However, there is little substantive data estimating the prevalence of intellectual disabilities within the Irish prison system. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors systematically review published data relating to the prevalence of intellectual disabilities in prisons in the Republic of Ireland. The authors searched four databases, governmental websites and corresponded with experts.
   Findings - Little published data were elicited from searches except for one nationwide cross-sectional survey which reflected a higher prevalence than reported in international studies. Studies from forensic mental health populations are narrated to contextualise findings.
   Originality/value - This study found that there is little data to accurately estimate the prevalence of intellectual disabilities in the Irish prison system and the limited data available suggests that this is likely to be higher than international estimates. The authors highlight the need for further research to accurately estimate prevalence in this jurisdiction, alongside the need to develop screening and care pathways for prisoners with an intellectual disability.

AB  - Over the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods have provided new insights into the network organization of the human brain. Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.

AB  - Understanding the economic impact of psychological and social forms of workplace aggression to society could yield important insights into the magnitude of this occupational phenomenon. The objective of this systematic review was to collate, summarise, review and critique, and synthesise the cost of psychosocial workplace aggression at the individual- and societal-level. A peer-reviewed research protocol detailing the search strategy, study selection procedures and data extraction process was developed a priori. Both the academic and grey literatures were examined. To allow for basic comparison, all costs were converted and adjusted to reflect 2014 US dollars. Twelve studies, from 5 national contexts, met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed: Australia (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), the United Kingdom (n = 3) and the United States (n = 5). The annual cost of psychosocial workplace aggression varied substantially, ranging between $114.64 million and $35.9 billion. Heterogeneity across studies was found, with noted variations in stated study aims, utilised prevalence statistics and included costs. The review concludes that existing evidence attests to the substantial cost of psychosocial workplace aggression to both the individual and society, albeit such derived estimates are likely gross underestimates. The findings highlight the importance of interpreting such figures within their conceptual and methodological contexts.

AB  - The landscape of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has evolved remarkably in recent years and is barely recognizable from two decades ago. Knowledge of the clinical phenomenology, cognition, neuroimaging, genetics, pathology of the different subtypes of FTD, and their relations to other neurodegenerative conditions, has increased rapidly, due in part, to the growing interests into these neurodegenerative brain conditions. This article reviews the major advances in the field of FTD over the past 20 years, focusing primarily on the work of Frontier, the frontotemporal dementia clinical research group, based in Sydney, Australia. Topics covered include clinical presentations (cognition, behavior, neuroimaging), pathology, genetics, and disease progression, as well as interventions and carer directed research. This review demonstrates the improvement in diagnostic accuracy and capacity to provide advice on genetic risks, prognosis, and outcome. The next major challenge will be to capitalize on these research findings to develop effective disease modifying drugs, which are currently lacking.

AB  - Cannabis, or the dried leaves, stems, and seeds of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, is the most widely used illicit drug in America. Typically smoked, vaporized or ingested orally, cannabis is used primarily for recreational purposes, though a few synthetic cannabinoids have been approved for medicinal treatments. Psychoactive cannabinoids, or the pharmacologically active compounds within cannabis, are responsible for producing the infamous "high" sensation, characterized by feelings of euphoria and relaxation, though can also provoke hallucinations, paranoia and anxiety. Cannabinoids act on G-protein coupled receptors in the brain, primarilyCB1 receptors, that typically decrease neural activity and modulate transmitter release. Compared to other drugs of abuse, cannabis use has minimal health risks and almost no potential for fatal overdose, though the trademark method of administration (smoking) has detrimental consequences. Chronic heavy use can also lead to changes in memory, cognitive deficits, psychosis and dependence. Up to 9% of users can develop a cannabis dependence, characterized by a characteristic withdrawal syndrome. The growing prevalence of cannabis use has spurred the development of animals models to research the neurobehavioral basis of cannabis use. Traditional animal models of drug abuse (i.e., conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration) have historically struggled to establish rewarding or reinforcing effects of individual cannabinoid molecules. Decades of research have been needed to reveal the appropriate dosage and conditions to promote reward and reinforcement in animal models. While the field has made great strides in elucidating the mechanisms involved in behavioral pharmacology cannabinoids, the social aspects of cannabis use remains underrepresented in animal models. Social interactions are vital to the initiation and continuation of cannabis use in humans, and this component has yet to be accurately captured in current animal models.

AB  - There are several biological factors that might play a role in physiological response to opioids and/or the onset of problematic opioid use; however, sex-based differences in non-analgesic opioid-based effects are poorly understood. The goal of this review is to provide a current analysis of the pre-clinical literature on sex-based differences in response to endogenous and exogenous opioids, including the interplay between sex hormones and opioid receptor-mediated neuronal activity and associated behaviours. A systematic search was performed on the following terms within PubMed between March and April 2018: 'opioid oestrogen', 'opioid progesterone', 'opioid oestradiol', and 'opioid testosterone'. Pre-clinical research on the non-analgesic, sex-based effects of opioids is disparate, both in terms of methodology and outcomes, which prohibits a cohesive summary of the results. Themes from the pre-clinical literature suggest that opioid receptor binding, coupling, and density vary as a function of hormone exposure. Findings also suggest that interactions between endogenous opioid and stress systems may differ between males and females as a function of ovarian hormones. Given the current opioid-related public health crisis, there is a pressing need to increase systematic pre-clinical and clinical research on sex-based differences in opioid-effects and opioid use disorder.

AB  - Multiple disorders once jointly conceived as "nervous diseases" became segregated by the distinct institutional traditions forged in neurology and psychiatry. As a result, each field specialized in the study and treatment of a subset of such conditions. Here we propose new avenues for interdisciplinary interaction through a triangulation of both fields with social neuroscience. To this end, we review evidence from five relevant domains (facial emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind, moral cognition, and social context assessment), highlighting their common disturbances across neurological and psychiatric conditions and discussing their multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Our proposal is anchored in multidimensional evidence, including behavioral, neurocognitive, and genetic findings. From a clinical perspective, this work paves the way for dimensional and transdiagnostic approaches, new pharmacological treatments, and educational innovations rooted in a combined neuropsychiatric training. Research-wise, it fosters new models of the social brain and a novel platform to explore the interplay of cognitive and social functions. Finally, we identify new challenges for this synergistic framework.

AB  - Browsing the literature shows that an increasing number of authors choose to use the learning by teaching approach in the field of educational robotics. The goal of this paper is, on the one hand, to produce a review of articles describing the effects of this approach on learning and, on the other hand, to review the literature in order to explore the characteristics at the core of this approach. We will only focus on the work using a humanoid robot. The areas of learning studied are writing, reading, vocabulary, and reasoning, but also there are some metacognitive abilities like task commitment and mental state attribution. Their targets are from very young children to preadolescents. We can already notice some studies on pupils with special educational needs. In all of these domains, the results show a nonnegligible effect of learning by teaching both on learning and on metacognitive abilities. If the concept of learning by teaching is clear, a careful investigation of the different studies shows that experimental paradigms do not use the same basic characteristics. For some, it is the robot's weakness, the care that must be given to it, which is the main requirement for the approach, while for others it is the unbalanced distribution of knowledge which is at the heart of it. The learning by teaching approach we will study has two components: the robot and the child tutor. The characteristics of the robot and what is asked of the child to accomplish his or her task of the tutor will be analyzed.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an orphan, fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain etiology that is clinically characterized by various combinations of parkinsonism, cerebellar, autonomic, and motor dysfunction. MSA is an alpha-synucleinopathy with specific glioneuronal degeneration involving striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic nervous systems but also other parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The major clinical variants correlate with the morphologic phenotypes of striatonigral degeneration (MSA-P) and olivopontocerebellar atrophy (MSA-C). While our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of this devastating disease is still incomplete, updated consensus criteria and combined fluid and imaging biomarkers have increased its diagnostic accuracy. The neuropathologic hallmark of this unique proteinopathy is the deposition of aberrant alpha-synuclein in both glia (mainly oligodendroglia) and neurons forming glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that cause cell dysfunction and demise. In addition, there is widespread demyelination, the pathogenesis of which is not fully understood. The pathogenesis of MSA is characterized by propagation of misfolded alpha-synuclein from neurons to oligodendroglia and cell-to-cell spreading in a "prion-like" manner, oxidative stress, proteasomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of myelin lipids, decreased neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and energy failure. The combination of these mechanisms finally results in a system-specific pattern of neurodegeneration and a multisystem involvement that are specific for MSA. Despite several pharmacological approaches in MSA models, addressing these pathogenic mechanisms, no effective neuroprotective nor disease-modifying therapeutic strategies are currently available. Multidisciplinary research to elucidate the genetic and molecular background of the deleterious cycle of noxious processes, to develop reliable biomarkers and targets for effective treatment of this hitherto incurable disorder is urgently needed.

AB  - Iron is essential for cellular development and maintenance of multiple physiological processes in the central nervous system. The disturbance of its homeostasis leads to abnormal iron deposition in the brain and causes neurotoxicity via generation of free radicals and oxidative stress. Iron toxicity has been established in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease; however, its contribution to multiple system atrophy (MSA) remains elusive. MSA is characterized by cytoplasmic inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) in oligodendrocytes referred to as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). Remarkably, the oligodendrocytes possess high amounts of iron, which together with GCI pathology make a contribution toward MSA pathogenesis likely. Consistent with this observation, the GCI density is associated with neurodegeneration in central autonomic networks as well as olivopontocerebellar and striatonigral pathways. Iron converts native alpha-SYN into a alpha-sheet conformation and promotes its aggregation either directly or via increasing levels of oxidative stress. Interestingly, alpha-SYN possesses ferrireductase activity and alpha-SYN expression underlies iron mediated translational control via RNA stem loop structures. Despite a correlation between progressive putaminal atrophy and iron accumulation as well as clinical decline, it remains unclear whether pathologic iron accumulation in MSA is a secondary event in the cascade of neuronal degeneration rather than a primary cause. This review summarizes the current knowledge of iron in MSA and gives evidence for perturbed iron homeostasis as a potential pathogenic factor in MSA-associated neurodegeneration.

AB  - In preparing for an aging global population, older adults' well-being has become an urgent priority across the world. Counseling psychologists have also called upon the field for more empirical attention on older adults. Yet, a review of the literature revealed that older adults were represented in less than 2% of all the articles in the Journal of Counseling Psychology (JCP) and The Counseling Psychologist (TCP) from 1991 to 2000. The current study presents a follow-up review of older adult research in counseling psychology literature between 2001 and 2015 in the following mainstream journals: Counselling Psychology Quarterly (CPQ), JCP, and TCQ. Results suggest a decline in the past 15 years, with less than 1% of the total articles in JCP, TCP, and CPQ devoted to older adults. Most of the studies employed cross-sectional survey research design to examine predictors of mental health. A number of studies focused on culture-specific experiences of diverse older adults. Implications and suggestions for future research on older adult issues are discussed in relation to the principles and interests rooted in the field of counseling psychology.

AB  - Background: Deterioration of hand motor function is a possible risk factor of cognitive impairment in older adults. Despite a growing body of research, a lack of clarity exists regarding the relationships. This review offers a synthesis of existing observational studies evaluating the associations of handgrip strength and hand dexterity with cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect were systematically searched (search dates: 1990-2016), and relevant articles were cross-checked for related and relevant publications.
   Results: Twenty-two observational studies assessed the association of handgrip strength or hand dexterity with cognitive performance; none evaluated handgrip strength and hand dexterity together. Handgrip strength was associated with global cognition, mostly assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Also, one cross-sectional and three longitudinal studies found an association with cognitive domains, such as language, memory, visuospatial ability, working memory, and processing speed. Hand dexterity was only assessed cross-sectionally in four studies. These studies found an association with cognitive domains, such as executive function.
   Conclusions: Although handgrip strength was associated with cognitive performance, it is unclear which variable at baseline affects the other in the long-term. Cross-sectional studies indicate an association between hand dexterity and cognitive performance, yet longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate this association. The interaction effects of both decreased grip strength and hand dexterity on cognitive performance is still unclear; therefore, future studies will need to consider the interaction of the three variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiology and variable pathology. While a subset of cases is associated with single-gene mutations, the majority originates from a combination of factors we do not fully understand. Thus, understanding the underlying causes of PD is indispensable for the development of novel therapeutics. Glycation, the non-enzymatic reaction between reactive dicarbonyls and amino groups, gives rise to a variety of different reaction products known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs accumulate over a proteins life-time, and increased levels of glycation reaction products play a role in diabetic complications. It is now also becoming evident that PD patients also display perturbed sugar metabolism and protein glycation, including that of alpha-synuclein, a key player in PD. Here, we hypothesize that anti-diabetic drugs targeting the levels of glycation precursors, or promoting the clearance of glycated proteins may also prove beneficial for PD patients.

The subject matter of our work includes the introduction of HBI methodology to clinics and the search for neuromarkers in particular disease entities.
   What is the new methodology we are talking about? In general, we think of a biomarker (or biological marker) as a characteristic that can be objectively measured and evaluated as an index of normal or pathological biological processes. For disorders of the central nervous system, biomarkers can be classified as clinical, neuroimaging, biochemical or genetic, according to the type of information they provide. Expectations for the development of biomarkers are high, since they could lead to a significant improvement in diagnosing and possibly preventing neurological and psychiatric diseases. Neuroimaging is an array of neuroscience methods that include the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and PET (positron emission tomography), as well as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) techniques, such as quantitative EEG (QEEG), event related de/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and event-related potentials (ERPs).

KW  - meta-analysis
KW  - AEROBIC EXERCISE

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common disorders in the world, but is generally refractory to antidepressant treatment. However, physical exercise has been demonstrated to improve MDD symptoms, though the mechanism through which this is achieved is not clear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify whether physical exercise increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in patients with MDD to either establish or rule out this effect as a possible mechanism.
   Subjects and methods: We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CHINAL, Cochran Library, and Japanese Central Review of Medicine) for interventional studies released prior to 24 October 2017, examining the effects of physical exercise on BDNF in patients with MDD that compared the experimental group with an MDD control group. Those studies meeting the inclusion criteria were subjected to a meta-analysis in which changes of BDNF from baseline to post-exercise were quantified, with a standard mean difference and random effect model.
   Results: Five studies were eligible and included 199 participants. All articles included subjects with severe symptoms; three articles studied inpatient populations. All articles introduced aerobic exercise. We found no significant effect of physical exercise on BDNF levels (Z=0.32, p=0.75), and no heterogeneity (I-2=0%). The risk of bias was moderate.
   Conclusions: We conclude that physical exercise does not significantly increase BDNF in patients with MDD. Thus, while increased BDNF has been shown to be beneficial in patients with MDD, physical exercise likely produces its benefits through a different mechanism. However, the small number of included articles and lack of multiple reviewers increase the risk of the result being a false negative.

AB  - Many stroke survivors experience fatigue, which is associated with a variety of factors including cognitive impairment. A few studies have examined the relationship between fatigue and cognition and have obtained conflicting results. The aim of the current study was to review the literature on the relationship between fatigue and cognition post-stroke. The following databases were searched: EMBASE (1980-February, 2014), PsycInfo (1806-February, 2014), CINAHL (1937-February, 2014), MEDLINE (1946-February, 2014), Ethos (1600-February, 2014) and DART (1999-February, 2014). Reference lists of relevant papers were screened and the citation indices of the included papers were searched using Web of Science. Studies were considered if they were on adult stroke patients and assessed the following: fatigue with quantitative measurements ( 3 response categories), cognition using objective measurements, and the relationship between fatigue and cognition. Overall, 413 papers were identified, of which 11 were included. Four studies found significant correlations between fatigue and memory, attention, speed of information processing and reading speed (r=-.36 to .46) whereas seven studies did not. Most studies had limitations; quality scores ranged from 9 to 14 on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklists. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a relationship between fatigue and cognition post-stroke. More robust studies are needed.

AB  - Background: Research indicates that parents influence their children's physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors (SB) through their parenting styles and practices.
   Objective: The objectives of this paper were to evaluate existing research examining the associations between parenting styles, parenting practices, and PA and SB among Latino children aged between 2 and 12 years, highlight limitations of the existing research, and generate suggestions for future research.
   Methods: The method of this integrative review was informed by methods developed by Whittemore and Knafl, which allow for the inclusion of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses guidelines, five electronic academic databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and CINAHL) were searched for peer-reviewed, full-text papers published in English. Of the 641 unique citations identified, 67 full-text papers were retrieved, and 16 were selected for review.
   Results: The majority of the 16 reviewed studies were conducted with predominantly Mexican American or Mexican immigrant samples, and only 1 study examined the association between parenting styles and Latino children's PA and SB. Most (n=15) reviewed studies assessed the influence of parenting practices on children's PA and SB, and they provide good evidence that parenting practices such as offering verbal encouragement, prompting the child to be physically active, providing logistic support, engaging and being involved in PA, monitoring, and offering reinforcement and rewards encourage, facilitate, or increase children's PA. The examined studies also provide evidence that parenting practices, such as setting rules and implementing PA restrictions due to safety concerns, weather, and using psychological control discourage, hinder, or decrease children's PA.
   Conclusions: Because this review found a very small number of studies examining the relationship between parenting styles and Latino children's PA and SB, additional research is needed. Given that the majority of reviewed studies were conducted with predominantly Mexican American or Mexican immigrant samples, additional research examining parenting styles, parenting practices, and PA and SB among multiethnic Latino groups is needed to design interventions tailored to the needs of this ethnically diverse population group.

   Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent and disabling medical conditions worldwide. Despite its considerable burden, our understanding of its pathophysiology remains rudimentary, and a validated biomarker has yet to be identified. Antidepressants are the most common treatment for MDD, yet roughly one-third of patients experience an inadequate response. Thus, there is a great need for not only identifying biomarkers of MDD but also those that can predict and monitor or just monitor response to treatment.
   Recent findings
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as endogenous fine-tuners and on-off switches of gene expression. Several lines of evidence now suggest that miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. As such, miRNAs offer great hope as biomarkers of disease and response to treatment.
   Summary
   In this review, we discuss the growing field, investigating peripheral miRNAs as potential biomarkers of major depression and treatment response. A noninvasive and validated biomarker of MDD or treatment response will help clinicians guide treatment selection. Ultimately, these findings provide important steps in the development of early diagnostic tools, preventive strategies, and effective pharmacological treatment for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology manifested by cognitive impairment and behavioral derangement. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) as non-invasive and safe neuromodulation technique has shown promising effects in different neuropsychiatric disorders. Similarly, tDCS has recently shown potential therapeutic outcomes in AD. The present study aims to systematically review the therapeutic efficacy of tDCS in patients with AD.
   Method: The databases of PubMed (1970-2017), Web of Sciences (1970-2017), and Google Scholar (1980-2017) were searched using the set terms "tDCS" OR "transcranial direct current stimulation" AND "Alzheimer's disease" OR "AD" AND "treatment". The search engine Trip Database was used and the date of last search was August 30, 2017. The retrieved records were reviewed Independently by two authors.
   Results: Seven studies were obtained with a total of 185 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Evaluating the results, 4 studies supported the possible efficacy of the therapy versus 3 that did not find statistically significant differences compared with the placebo groups. Anodal tDCS over frontal cortex, particularly left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex, showed therapeutic efficacy in AD.
   Conclusion: Further studies are needed to determine effective protocols and clinical efficacy of tDCS for AD treatment. However, the current evidence from clinical trials encourages further research to investigate anodal tDCS as an adjuvant treatment for patients with AD.

AB  - The Editors of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease invited Professor Patrizia Mecocci to contribute a review article focused on the importance and implications of her research on aging, brain aging, and senile dementias over the last years. This invitation was based on an assessment that she was one of the journal's top authors and a strong supporter of the concept that oxidative stress is a major contributor to several alterations observed in age-related conditions (sarcopenia, osteoporosis) and, more significantly, in brain aging suggesting a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of one of the most dramatic age-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Her first pioneering research was on the discovery of high level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OH8dG), a marker of oxidation in nucleic acids, in mitochondrial DNA isolated from cerebral cortex. This molecule increases progressively with aging and more in AD brain, supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress, a condition of unbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, gives a strong contribution to the high incidence of AD in old age subjects. OH8dG also increases in peripheral lymphocyte from AD subjects, suggesting that AD is not only a cerebral but also a systemic disease. The role of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E and zinc, were also studied in longevity and in cognitive decline and dementia. This review shows the main findings from Mecocci's laboratory related to oxidative stress in aging, brain aging, and AD and discusses the importance and implications of some of the major achievements in this field of research.

AB  - Introduction: In the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the identification of functional impairments in home context is an important feature for the diagnosis. Objective: To evaluate the scientific knowledge regarding household participation of children with attention deficit with hyperactivity and implications for clinical practice. Method: A systematic review was performed using the keywords: "attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity", "ADHD", "household chores" and "household task" at PUBMED and SCOPUS. The inclusion criteria adopted were: original articles, in English, studied population composed of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 6 to 17 years old, and articles available in their complete versions. Results: The search resulted in 43 articles, and only four studies were included. From the analysis of the articles, it was verified that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder perform tasks similar to children with typical development. However, children with ADHD receive more assistance of caregivers than their peers. Age, gender, presence of older sibling, and the importance attributed by parents seem to be associated with increased task performance, while oppositional symptoms, diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and parental stress level seem to be associated with increased care from caregivers. Conclusion: Few studies evaluated household chores participation of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the findings cannot be generalized. Future investigations about other factors of home environment still need to improve the knowledge about the participation of this population and then to guide interventions in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Clinically, personality disorder (PD) commonly coexists with alcohol use disorder (AUD), although within mainstream mental health services both of these mental disorders are routinely overlooked. Despite a rich literature examining the interactions between AUD and personality functioning, personality traits, and PD, there remains conflicting evidence as to the degree of association and impact of one on the other. Methods: A narrative review and a synthesis of the literature were done. Results: The lifetime prevalence of AUD approaches 50% in some PD populations. The rates of PD in AUD populations are less clear but likely similar. Personality influences outcomes in AUD regardless of whether a categorical personality diagnosis or dimensional trait domain approach is taken. There are, however, no good data to inform clinicians on the impact of AUD on the outcomes of PD. Understanding the extent of this impact is complicated by the multiple tools used for diagnosis (of both PD and AUD) and the statistical methods used. Overall, caution is required in interpreting the data due to the quality of the current literature; however, comorbidity between the two disorders is likely significant and the impact of PD on AUD outcomes is sufficient to require consideration. Conclusions: From a research perspective, better agreement on both diagnoses and outcomes is urgently needed to improve the overall quality of the evidence. Clinically, despite the limitations in the literature, it is unacceptable for PD services to ignore AUD and for AUD services not to screen for PD. Both are likely to have an impact on health and functioning and should be considered in routine reviews. A better conceptualization of the putative mechanisms of this interaction, as well as an understanding of the neurobiology and reasons for the impact on treatment outcomes, will help to move the field forward.

AB  - The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex are interconnected brain regions, playing central roles in higher brain functions, including learning and memory, planning complex cognitive behavior, and moderating social behavior. The axons in these regions continue to be myelinated into adulthood in humans, which coincides with maturation of personality and decision-making. Myelin consists of dense layers of lipid membranes wrapping around the axons to provide electrical insulation and trophic support and can profoundly affect neural circuit computation. Recent studies have revealed that long-lasting changes of myelination can be induced in these brain regions by experience, such as social isolation, stress, and alcohol abuse, as well as by neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. However, the mechanism and function of these changes remain poorly understood. Myelin regulation represents a new form of neural plasticity. Some progress has been made to provide new mechanistic insights into activity-independent and activity-dependent regulations of myelination in different experimental systems. More extensive investigations are needed in this important but underexplored research field, in order to shed light on how higher brain functions and myelination interplay in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - This paper is devoted to illustrating how process neuropsychology and neurolinguistics, based on microgenetic theory and rooted in process thought, can help to explain the often baffling symptomatology of brain damage. Our purpose is to present an overview of this difficult and complex subject matter for readers, with particular emphasis on its creative potential. The essence of microgenetic theory in neuro psy chology is an account of the phases in brain process through which successive mind/brain states arise and perish over the duration of the psychological present, measured in milliseconds. According to the theory, mental states are rhythmically generated out of a "core" in the anatomically deepest and phylogenetically oldest parts of the central nervous system, over phases to the outermost and youngest regions of the brain, the neocortex. The clinical applications are only one aspect of the creative potential of microgenetic theory. Indeed, the elegance of the theory consists in the way in which it can be extended into a number of different fields of endeavor, providing a kind of "unified field theory" for the explanation of often rather diverse phenomena. This provides an opportunity for neuropsychology and neurolinguistics to resume the interdisciplinary discourse they were founded to conduct.

AB  - Purpose - Studies on psychiatric comorbidity in individuals with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) are scarce, particularly with respect to certain diseases frequently observed in clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relevance of epidemiological research to psychiatric comorbidity in people with BIF.
   Design/methodology/approach - Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Inclusion criteria: publications about BIF appearing between 1995 and 2017; epidemiological findings about comorbid mental disorders in individuals with BIF; and studies comparing BIF, mild intellectual disability (ID) and normal intellectual functioning. The discussion covers 24 of the 224 studies initially considered.
   Findings - The most frequent psychiatric comorbidity reported was personality, post-traumatic as well as psychotic disorders, followed by psychosis, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, bipolar and sleep disorders. Individuals with BIF exhibit psychiatric comorbidity more frequently than individuals with normal intellectual functioning. Some psychiatric comorbidities were similarly prevalent in patients with BIF and those with mild or moderate ID; however, the prevalence was always higher in people with severe ID. Environmental factors, especially psychosocial adversity, seem to play an important mediating role. Pharmacotherapy is the most common treatment approach, including behavioural disorders.
   Originality/value - This review of literature on mental disorders in people with BIF demonstrates the epidemiological relevance of psychiatric comorbidity, especially personality and post-traumatic disorders. Mental health professionals, general practitioners and other workers in outpatient settings have to be aware about the vulnerability and even fragility of people with BIF.

AB  - Split-brain patients constitute a small subpopulation of epileptic patients who have received the surgical resection of the callosal fibers in an attempt to reduce the spread of epileptic foci between the cerebral hemispheres. The study of callosotomy patients allowed neuropsychologists to investigate the effects of the hemispheric disconnection, shedding more light on the perceptual and cognitive abilities of each hemisphere in isolation. This view that callosotomy completely isolates the hemispheres has now been revised, in favor of the idea of a dynamic functional reorganization of the two sides of the brain; however, the evidence collected from split-brain patients is still a milestone in the neurosciences. The right-hemispheric superiority found in the healthy population concerning face perception has been further supported with split-brains, and it has been shown that the right disconnected hemisphere appears superior to the left hemisphere in recognizing and processing faces with similar characteristics as the observers' (e. g., gender, identity, etc.). Even more controversial is the field of hemispheric asymmetries for processing facial emotion, some evidence suggesting a right-hemispheric superiority for all emotions, some others showing a complementary hemispheric asymmetry depending on the positive or negative emotional valence. Although the practice of callosotomy is mostly abandoned today in favor of pharmacological alternatives, further studies on the remaining split-brain patients could help advance our understanding of hemispheric specialization for social stimuli.

AB  - The treatment of obesity and eating disorders such as binge-eating disorder or anorexia nervosa is challenging. Besides lifestyle changes and pharmacological options, bariatric surgery represents a well-established and effective-albeit invasive-treatment of obesity, whereas for binge-eating disorder and anorexia nervosa mostly psychotherapy options exist. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a method that influences the neuronal network, is by now known for its safe and effective applicability in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, the use does not seem to be restricted to these patients. Recent preclinical and first clinical evidence points towards the use of DBS in patients with obesity and eating disorders as well. Depending on the targeted area in the brain, DBS can either inhibit food intake and body weight or stimulate energy intake and subsequently body weight. The current review focuses on preclinical and clinical evidence of DBS to modulate food intake and body weight and highlight the different brain areas targeted, stimulation protocols applied and downstream signaling modulated. Lastly, this review will also critically discuss potential safety issues and gaps in knowledge to promote further studies.

AB  - Objective: Depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and hospital readmission in patients with heart failure (HF). This systematic review aimed to compile studies examining whether the use of antidepressants could improve outcome in patients with HF and concomitant depression.Methods: The electronic libraries Embase, OVID MEDLINE(R) and PsychInfo were used to search the following terms heart failure' AND anti-depressants'; heart failure' AND TCA' OR SSRI' OR SNRI'. The result of this database search was analysed to select papers that satisfied our inclusion criteria.Results: Of the 180 papers found in the original database search, only three met the inclusion criteria. A further two papers were added from hand-searching through the references. Three of these papers are randomised controlled trials (RCT); the other two, cohort studies.All studies show that antidepressants are well tolerated in this group. There was no significant difference in depressive symptoms between the test and placebo. The cardiac outcomes of patients with HF are not improved by the use of antidepressants relative to placebo.Conclusions: Antidepressants are not associated with increased mortality rate as established in previous papers. However, there is inadequate evidence that the use of antidepressants effects significant improvement in depression or cardiac outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with mental health issues usually access primary health care services but employment status and/or return to work is not typically an explicit focus of a general practice consultation.
   OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to investigate the broad range of interventions used in primary health care to effectively support people with mental health issues to choose, get, or keep employment.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted using five electronic databases. Peer reviewed research articles published between 1996 and February 2016 were included in the review.
   RESULTS: Twelve studies explored work related interventions for people with mental health issues in the primary health care context. The most commonly used intervention was sickness certification, other interventions that show promise were identified but there is limited empirical evidence to show their effectiveness in relation to improving employment outcomes. General practitioners identified a range of barriers in terms of focusing on employment outcomes for patients including knowledge and confidence in understanding the impact of work on symptoms and limited access to advice or services to refer patients to.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that work focused interventions situated in primary health care settings appear to be a promising approach for people with mental health issues. However, various barriers impact the implementation of an employment approach, with limited comparisons between different effective interventions. In the context of increasing numbers of people presenting with mental health issues, future research should address the implementation and effectiveness of work-focused interventions based in primary health care.

AB  - Introduction: The psychiatric reform has demanded to Occupational Therapy a boarder type of care focused on autonomy production of individuals facing social exclusion. Despite the wide academic production in this subject, there is lack of studies addressing professional practice on new mental health services. Objective: This work aims to identify occupational therapy mental health practices through a scope review of the XI to XIV annals of Brazilian Occupational Therapy Congresses. Method: A total of 165 abstracts were analyzed. Results: The results show predominance of reports of experience and abstracts from the Southeastern region, with more adult-oriented practices in Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS), in group and individual strategies, with no focus on medical diagnoses, and with little explanation of theoretical references. Qualitatively, the results highlight psychosocial rehabilitation as reference, and particularities of the therapeutic process and practical experiences in professional training. Conclusion: We believe that the dialogue between issues and impasses about these practices encourages reflections on assistance and research in occupational therapy in Brazil in mental health field.

KW  - PRINCIPLES
KW  - FOUNDATION
AB  - Background: Ethical dilemmas are common in the field of mental health, and often, ethical guidelines fail to provide clear courses of action. Historically, ethical decision-making models have been proposed which utilize a position rationality and positivism. While these ethical decision-making models have expanded over time to incorporate contextual factors, they often fail to adequately integrate personal imperatives and remain flexible enough to be generalized across settings and situations.
   Method: The goal of the present article is to provide those in the field of mental health with a virtue-driven ethical decision-making model that provides a balance between guided structure and personalization with the intent of integrating personal and professional identities for use in confronting ethical dilemmas.
   Results: An ethical decision-making model is presented that incorporates virtues found to be relevant to the field of mental health, characterized by six stages: observation, identification, consultation, balance, action and reflection.
   Conclusion: Ethical practice is heightened when professionals engage in synthesizing personal and professional values in order to increase a personal ethical imperative, rather than a rule-based ethical imperative, and when structured models are put in place for use when ethics codes fail or are deemed not useful.

AB  - Some barriers to dental treatment during pregnancy are poorly understood, especially those related to psychosocial factors, which are better explored in qualitative studies. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the barriers and facilitators to dental care during pregnancy through a thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French, from 2000 to 2016, were included. The search strategies were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, BBO and CINAHL. To evaluate the quality of the studies, we used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Thematic synthesis was performed in order to interpret and summarize the results. From 2,581 screened studies, ten were included in the synthesis. We found 14 analytical themes related to barriers and facilitators to dental care during pregnancy that interacted in complex ways: physiological conditions, low importance of oral health, negative stigma regarding dentistry, fear of/anxiety toward dental treatment, mobility and safety, financial barriers, employment, time constraints, social support, lack of information, health professionals' barriers, family and friends' advice, beliefs and myths about the safety of dental treatment. Myths and beliefs about oral health and dental treatment during pregnancy appear to be the most frequent barriers, both to pregnant women and to dentists or other health professionals. The findings of this review may support new studies, especially to test intervention protocols and to guide effective public policies for the promotion of oral health during pregnancy.

AB  - This chapter examines the importance of studying hand preference together with different expressions of behavior. Cognitive differences between left-and right-handed primates are discussed. As shown in several species of primate, eye preference, but not hand preference, is biased at the level of the population and reflects hemispheric asymmetry of processing. Hand preference, determined from simple grasping of pieces of food and taking them to the mouth, is consistent for individuals but it is not population biased. It is a measure of an individual's preference to use a particular hemisphere, and hence which cognitive processes are characteristic of the individual. Compared to left-handed subjects, right-handed subjects are more active in exploring novel objects, show more social facilitation of behavior, have a positive cognitive bias, and express lower levels of fear and stress responses. In marmosets, learning of food searching tasks is not associated with hand preference. Strength of hand preference, rather than its direction, is linked to the ability to perform two tasks at once, viz., detection of a predator while searching for food. Marmosets with strong hand preferences are able to perform these two tasks at once but those with weak or no hand preference are unable to do so.

AB  - Schizophrenia affects around 0.3-0.7% people at some point in their lives - or 24 million people worldwide. This review covers topics of broad general interest that have seen significant development or progress in recent years. This paper aims to review the scientific literature of the past 10 years on metabolic syndrome regarding the quality of life of people with schizophrenia and the interventions carried out. A bibliographical search was conducted on Web of Science and PsycINFO, using the keywords of this study. More than 90 publications were found, 70 of which met the requirements. The main topic was schizophrenia, metabolic syndrome and quality of life. Those that focused on the effects of drugs were excluded. Although the association between mental illness and physical health problems has been convincingly demonstrated, numerous studies support the existence of dual physical health care neglect of people with schizophrenia. On the other hand, the modifiable risk factors are clearly defined to improve the physical health of these patients as well as the aspects which should be included in any approach to improve metabolic syndrome in particular, physical health in general, and thus modify the self-perceived quality of life. The data on psychoeducational treatments for this population were insufficient. However, some studies show that the implementation of behavioral interventions in clinical practice can help patients improve their overall health and prevent chronic disease. There are few studies on the application of ehealth devices to schizophrenic patients.

AB  - In 2002 a series of mutations in the GDAP1 gene were reported in patients suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease manifesting as early-onset, progressive distal-muscle wasting and weakness. The molecular etiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth-GDAP1 disease has been elucidated but its pathogenesis remains unclear, especially given the seemingly contradictory function of the GDAP1 protein. Expression of GDAP1 is observed almost exclusively in neuronal cells, however, the GDAP1 protein is present in mitochondria, where it plays a role in fission, a ubiquitous process occurring in all cells. While GDAP1 contains two glutathione S-transferase (GST) domains, its GST activity is in fact very limited. Additionally, despite GDAP1 affecting mitochondria! functionality, and hence being of great importance to cellular function, the GDAPI-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is mainly characterized by axonal degeneration. Finally, mutations in the GDAP1 gene may be inherited in a recessive or dominant manner. Given the way such varied observations are hard to reconcile with one another, the investigation of GDAP1 is at one and the same time a difficult but also challenging endeavour. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the GDAP1 protein and its function in the cell. A further part is the characterization of GDAP1-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, its symptoms and course, as well as an outlining of the possible mechanisms underpinning the disorder.

We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases and identified 288 articles, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. After acute dosing, psychiatric, psychotomimetic, cardiovascular, neurological, and other side-effects were more frequently reported after ketamine treatment than after placebo in patients with depresssion. Our findings suggest a selective reporting bias with limited assessment of long-term use and safety and after repeated dosing, despite these being reported in other patient groups exposed to ketamine (eg, those with chronic pain) and in recreational users. We recommend large-scale clinical trials that include multiple doses of ketamine and long-term follow up to assess the safety of long-term regular use.

AB  - Psychotropic-induced hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance experienced in the psychiatric clinical practice. It is commonly seen in geriatric patients and it is always overlooked and untreated in psychiatric patients and this would explain why it leads to increased mortality. Psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and sedative-hypnotics can lead to hyponatremia, while it commonly occurs in antidepressant use. In this review, a thorough search was performed using the databases of ResearchGate, PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. This review aimed to shed light on the probable psychopathology, evaluation of hyponatremia, a closer look at different types of hyponatremia, and its incidence with various psychotropic medications. We also summarized the clinical presentations of hyponatremia, the identified risk factors with various psychotropic, and concluded by discussing the mainstay management of hyponatremia.

AB  - There is an unmet clinical need for objective biomarkers to monitor disease progression and treatment response in Huntington's disease (HD). The aim of this review is, therefore, to provide practical advice for biomarker discovery and to summarise studies on biofluid markers for HD. A PubMed search was performed to review literature with regard to candidate saliva, urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for HD. Information has been organised into tables to allow a pragmatic approach to the discussion of the evidence and generation of practical recommendations for future studies. Many of the markers published converge on metabolic and inflammatory pathways, although changes in other analytes representing antioxidant and growth factor pathways have also been found. The most promising markers reflect neuronal and glial degeneration, particularly neurofilament light chain. International collaboration to standardise assays and study protocols, as well as to recruit sufficiently large cohorts, will facilitate future biomarker discovery and development.

AB  - Recent developments in neuroaesthetics have heightened the need for causative approaches to more deeply understand the mechanism underlying perception, emotion, and aesthetic experiences. This has recently been the topic for empirical work, employing several causative methods for changing brain activity, as well as comparative assessments of individuals with brain damage or disease. However, one area of study with high potential, and indeed a long history of often nonscientific use in the area of aesthetics and art, employing psychopharmacological chemicals as means of changing brain function, has not been systematically utilized. This chapter reviews the literature on this topic, analyzing neuroendocrinological (neurochemical) approaches and mechanisms that might be used to causatively study the aesthetic brain. We focus on four relevant neuromodulatory systems potentially related to aesthetic experience: the dopaminergic, serotonergic, cannabinoid, and the opioidergic system. We build a bridge to psychopharmacological methods and review drug-induced behavioral and neurobiological consequences. We conclude with a discussion of hypotheses and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Reviews of attachment research point to fathers' capacity to provide for a secure child-parent attachment relationship; a suggested mechanism for the development of this relationship may be sensitive and challenging play interactions. This review synthesises research on fathers' challenging and stimulating play by mapping the variation in construct definitions and reporting on the association of fathers' stimulating play with child outcomes. Using search terms such as father, stimulatingand challenging, 26 studies were identified, including 16 longitudinal studies, which assessed the association between father-child stimulating or challenging play, and child outcomes. Five categories of stimulating play were derived from the analysis,ranging on a continuum of activation and complexity. Most studies reported positive associations with children's cognitive, psycho social and physical development. The discussion highlights the variation in the operationalisation of challenging and stimulating play, and suggestions for future research on the function of fathers' play interactions are made.

AB  - Health anxiety (HA) is defined as excessive worries focused on one's health. The cognitive-behavioral and the interpersonal models assume an association between childhood experiences and the development of HA. The aim of this review is to identify studies which have investigated the association between childhood and family factors and HA. The literature search was generated in PUBMED, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. 25 papers were included. The results show a trend toward an association between the presentation of HA in adulthood and intergenerational transmission of HA and illness beliefs, illness experiences during childhood, and an anxious attachment style. However, no strong empirical evidence could be determined for any of these factors. Possible directions for future research are discussed.

   Method Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for cohort or case-control control study designs in any population, reporting exposure to shift work as the main contributing factor to estimate CVD risk. For each study, adjusted relative risk (RR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted, and used to calculate the pooled RR using random-effect models. Meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. Potential non-linear dose-response relationships were examined using fractional polynomial models.
   Results We included 21 studies with a total of 173 010 unique participants. The majority of the studies were ranked low-to-moderate risk of bias. The risk of any CVD event was 17% higher among shift workers than day workers. The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity was 26% higher (1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.43, I-2 = 48.0%). Sub-group analysis showed an almost 20% higher risk of CVD and CHD mortality among shift workers than those who did not work shifts (1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.37, I-2 = 0% and 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32 I-2 = 0%; respectively). After the first five years of shift work, there was a 7.1% increase in risk of CVD events for every additional five years of exposure (95% CI 1.05-1.10). Heterogeneity of the pooled effect size (ES) estimates was high (I-2 = 67%), and meta-regression analysis showed that sample size explained 7.7% of this.
   Conclusions The association between shift work and CVD risk is non-linear and seems to appear only after the first five years of exposure. As shift work remains crucial for meeting production and service demands across many industries, policies and initiatives are needed to reduce shift workers' CVD risk.

AB  - Introduction: Dandy-Walker malformation is a rare congenital malformation involving cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, enlarged posterior fossa, complete or partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, elevated tentorium cerebelli, and hydrocephalus. Previous research highlighted a possible role for the cerebellum in schizophrenia as well as the contribution of underlying brain malformations to treatment resistance. Here, we present a case of a Dandy-Walker malformation-like condition revealed by a refractory schizophrenia in a 24-year-old male patient. We also conduct a literature review of all previously published case reports or case series of co-occurring posterior fossa abnormalities and schizophrenia or psychosis using a PubMed search query to better understand the potential link between these two disorders. Case Presentation: A 9-month hospital stay was needed to address the treatment-resistant psychotic symptoms, and the patient continued to experience moderate symptoms despite the prescription of various antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. After an irregular initial medical follow-up, the patient is currently treated with 350 mg daily clozapine and 20 mg daily prazepam and still exhibits moderate anxiety without delirious thoughts, however allowing him to re-enroll at the university. Regarding the literature, 24 cases published between 1996 and 2017 were identified, reviewed and compared to the present case report. Discussion: This case report and literature review further illuminates the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders including the potential role of the cerebellum, reinforces the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for the neurological and psychiatric management of patients with schizophrenia, and highlights optimal pharmacological management strategies for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

AB  - Being overweight or obese (overweight/obesity) or physically aggressive in childhood and adolescence can have lifelong consequences, hence are important public health problems. Identifying a relationship between these problems would assist in understanding their developmental origins. The present paper sought to review previous studies and use meta-analysis to evaluate whether there is evidence of a relationship between overweight/obesity and physical aggression in children and adolescents. A systematic search of studies that reported the effect of overweight/obesity (in the form of body mass index) on physical aggression was conducted. A total of 23 studies were identified, representing data from 255,377 participants. The results indicate that children and adolescents who are overweight or obese are more physically aggressive than their normal-weight or underweight peers. The average weighted standardized mean difference (the effect size) for aggression in overweight and obese children and adolescents compared to others was found to be 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI95]: .17-.37), and was significant (p<.001). Gender sub-analysis indicated that higher physical aggression amongst overweight or obese compared to normal-weight or underweight peers is a slightly larger effect for boys (standardized mean difference of .35, CI95: .18-.52, p<.001) than girls (standardized mean difference of .24, CI95: .07-.42, p<.01). High levels of heterogeneity (94.41%) were found between study-level effect sizes. The developmental processes that may explain the association between overweight/obesity and physical aggression in children and adolescents are discussed.

AB  - Background and Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown therapeutic efficacy in different psychiatric disorders including depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cognitive functions in healthy subjects have made this technique an interesting research option for developing non-medication techniques for a variety of psychiatric disorders. This paper aimed to comprehensively review the therapeutic applications of tDCS in psychiatric disorders.
   Method: The databases of PubMed (1985-2018), EMBASE (1985-2018), Web of Sciences (19852018), PsycINFO (1980-2018) and Google Scholar (1980-2018) were searched using the search terms "transcranial direct current stimulation" OR "tDCS" AND "psychiatric disorders" OR "neuropsychiatric disorders" AND "treatment" AND "efficacy". The retrieved records were screened for the title and abstract by two authors and the relevant papers were reviewed for further details. The applications of tDCS in the disorders with promising outcomes are discussed.
   Results: TDCS has shown therapeutic effects in different neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease (AD), tinnitus, obsessive compulsive disorder, hallucinations, and substance abuse. The clinical efficacy for major depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, and tinnitus is more promising. This may be partly because more studies have been conducted on these disorders than the other disorders. For depression tDCS shows treatment efficacy comparable with the first generation antidepressive pharmacological drugs. Anodal tDCS over prefrontal cortex (PFC) was the most used protocol for major depression. The anodal tDCS over frontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyms show promising therapeutic effects in ADHD. For tinnitus the most frequent used protocols are bifrontal and bilateral tDCS applied over dorsolateral PFC and auditory cortex. Anodal tDCS over frontal cortex particularly LDLPFC and temporal cortex showed therapeutic efficacy in AD. For schizophrenia, tDCS has shown effectiveness in reducing the disease's symptoms ranging from auditory hallucinations which the effects were the most marked to working memory, learning, negative and cognitive symptoms. The frequently used sites of stimulation were PFC and temporal cortex.
   Conclusion: The current evidence showed the therapeutic efficacies of tDCS as adjunctive or alternative treatment option for different neuropsychiatric disorders. TDCS due to its safe and cost-effective profile could be developed for symptoms amelioration or at least cognitive enhancement in these disorders. However, further studies with big sample size should be conducted to develop effective protocol for each disorder as well as understanding the mechanisms of action of tDCS in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Non-communicable diseases are on the rise globally. Risk factors of non-communicable diseases continue to be a growing concern in both developed and developing countries. With significant rise in population and establishment of buildings, rapid changes have taken place in the built environment. Relationship between health and place, particularly with non-communicable diseases has been established in previous literature. This systematic review assesses the current evidence on influence of gender in the relationship between built environment and non-communicable diseases. A systematic literature search using PubMed was done to identify all studies that reported relationship between gender and built environment. All titles and abstracts were scrutinised to include only articles based on risk factors, prevention, treatment and outcome of non-communicable diseases. The Gender Analysis Matrix developed by the World Health Organization was used to describe the findings of gender differences. Sex differences, biological susceptibility, gender norms/values, roles and activities related to gender and access to/control over resources were themes for the differences in the relationship. A total of 15 out of 214 articles met the inclusion criteria. Majority of the studies were on risk factors of non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases. Gender differences in physical access to recreational facilities, neighbourhood perceptions of safety and walkability have been documented. Men and women showed differential preferences to walking, engaging in physical activity and in perceiving safety of the neighbourhood. Girls and boys showed differences in play activities at school and in their own neighbourhood environment. Safety from crime and safety from traffic were also perceived important to engage in physical activity. Gender norms and gender roles and activities have shown basis for the differences in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Sparse evidence was found on how built environment affects health seeking behaviour, preventive options or experience with health providers. Though yet unexplored in the developing or low/middle income countries, there seems to be a major role in the gendered perception of how men and women are affected by non-communicable diseases. Large gaps still exist in the research evidence on gender-based differences in non-communicable diseases and built environment relationship. Future research directions could bring out underpinnings of how perceived and objective built environment could largely affect the health behaviour of men and women across the globe.

AB  - Background: Physical exercise benefits functioning, health, and well-being. However, people living with dementia in particular hardly engage in exercise. Exergaming (exercise and gaming) is an innovative, fun, and relatively safe way of exercising in a virtual reality or gaming environment. It may help people living with dementia overcome barriers they can experience regarding regular exercise activities.
   Objective: This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the cost-effectiveness of exergaming and its effects on physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, as well as the quality of life in people living with dementia.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science Core Collection were searched. Selection of studies was carried out by at least two independent researchers.
   Results: Three studies were found to be eligible and were included in this review. Two of these showed some statistically significant effects of exergaming on physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning in people living with dementia, although based on a very small sample. No articles were found about the cost-effectiveness of exergaming.
   Conclusion: Only a few controlled studies have been conducted into the effectiveness of exergaming, and these show very little significant benefits. More well-designed studies are necessary to examine the effects of exergaming.

AB  - Background: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second common form of dementia and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for aging-related disorders for thousands of years. However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence using CHM for VaD.
   Objective: To conduct a systematic review to assess the current evidence available for the effectiveness and safety of CHM for VaD.
   Methods: Six databases were searched for high-quality randomized-controlled clinical trials that met the requirements of at least 4 of the 7 domains of the Cochrane risk of bias tool from their inception to February 2017. RevMan 5.3 was applied for data analysis.
   Results: Forty studies with 42 comparisons and 3,572 individuals were included. The studies investigated the CHM versus placebo (n = 4), CHM versus western conventional treatment (WCT) (n = 36), and CHM plus WCT versus WCT (n = 2). Meta-analysis showed that CHM for VaD could improve Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Activities of Daily Living, Hasegawa's dementia scale, and clinical effective rate but had statistically similar effect based on Blessed Behavior Scale (BBS) outcome when compared with WCTs. When compared with placebo, CHMs were more beneficial in improving MMSE but showed no significant difference in BBS scores. CHM as adjuvant therapy exerted an additive anti-VaD benefit on MMSE scores. The participants of CHM group had fewer adverse events than that of the placebo group or WCT group.
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study support, at least to an extent, that CHM can be recommended for routine use for treatment of VaD.

AB  - Neuromodulatory systems, including the noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic systems, track environmental signals, such as risks, rewards, novelty, effort, and social cooperation. These systems provide a foundation for cognitive function in higher organisms; attention, emotion, goal-directed behavior, and decision-making derive from the interaction between the neuromodulatory systems and brain areas, such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and sensory cortices. Given their strong influence on behavior and cognition, these systems also play a key role in disease states and are the primary target of many current treatment strategies. The fact that these systems interact with each other either directly or indirectly, however, makes it difficult to understand how a failure in one or more systems can lead to a particular symptom or pathology. In this review, we explore experimental evidence, as well as focus on computational and theoretical models of neuromodulation. Better understanding of neuromodulatory systems may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for a number of brain disorders.

AB  - Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) contributes appreciably to the control of physiological function, such that pathological alterations in SNA can lead to a variety of diseases. The goal of this review is to discuss the characteristics of SNA, briefly review the methodology that has been used to assess SNA and its control, and to describe the essential role of neurophysiological studies in conscious animals to provide additional insights into the regulation of SNA. Studies in both humans and animals have shown that SNA is rhythmic or organized into bursts whose frequency varies depending on experimental conditions and the species. These rhythms are generated by brainstem neurons, and conveyed to sympathetic preganglionic neurons through several pathways, including those emanating from the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Although rhythmic SNA is present in decerebrate animals (indicating that neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord are adequate to generate this activity), there is considerable evidence that a variety of supratentorial structures including the insular and prefrontal cortices, amygdala, and hypothalamic subnuclei provide inputs to the brainstem regions that regulate SNA. It is also known that the characteristics of SNA are altered during stress and particular behaviors such as the defense response and exercise. While it is a certainty that supratentorial structures contribute to changes in SNA during these behaviors, the neural underpinnings of the responses are yet to be established. Understanding how SNA is modified during affective responses and particular behaviors will require neurophysiological studies in awake, behaving animals, including those that entail recording activity from neurons that generate SNA. Recent studies have shown that responses of neurons in the central nervous system to most sensory inputs are context-specific. Future neurophysiological studies in conscious animals should also ascertain whether this general rule also applies to sensory signals that modify SNA.

AB  - Ethanol is one of the most commonly abused drugs. Although environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of alcohol use disorders, it is ethanol's actions in the brain that explain (1) acute ethanol-related behavioral changes, such as stimulant followed by depressant effects, and (2) chronic changes in behavior, including escalated use, tolerance, compulsive seeking, and dependence. Our knowledge of ethanol use and abuse thus relies on understanding its effects on the brain. Scientists have employed both bottom-up and top-down approaches, building from molecular targets to behavioral analyses and vice versa, respectively. This review highlights current progress in the field, focusing on recent and emerging molecular, cellular, and circuit effects of the drug that impact ethanol-related behaviors. The focus of the field is now on pinpointing which molecular effects in specific neurons within a brain region contribute to behavioral changes across the course of acute and chronic ethanol exposure.

AB  - Germination-an important stage in the life cycle of plants-is susceptible to the presence of soil contaminants. Since the early 1990s, the use of germination tests to screen multiple plant species to select candidates for phytoremediation has received much attention. This is due to its inexpensive methodology and fast assessment relative to greenhouse or field growth studies. Surprisingly, no comprehensive synthesis is available of these studies in the scientific literature. As more plant species are added to phytoremediation databases, it is important to encapsulate the knowledge thus far and revise protocols. In this review, we have summarised previously-documented effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on germination and seedling growth. The methods and materials of previous studies are presented in tabulated form. Common practice includes the use of cellulose acetate filter paper, plastic Petri dishes, and low numbers of seeds and replicates. A general bias was observed for the screening of cultivated crops as opposed to native species, even though the latter may be better suited to site conditions. The relevance of germination studies as important ecotoxicological tools is highlighted with the proposed use of root imaging software. Screening of novel plant species, particularly natives, is recommended with selection focussed on (i) species phylogeny, (ii) plant morphological and functional traits, and (iii) tolerance towards harsh environmental stresses. Recommendations for standardised protocols for germination and early growth monitoring are made in order to improve the robustness of statistical modelling and species selection in future phytoremediation evaluations and field programs.

AB  - Background: In current psychiatric practice, antidepressants are widely and with ever-increasing frequency prescribed to patients. However, several scientific biases obfuscate estimates of antidepressants' efficacy and harm, and these are barely recognized in treatment guidelines. The aim of this mini-review is to critically evaluate the efficacy and harm of antidepressants for acute and maintenance treatment with respect to systematic biases related to industry funding and trial methodology.
   Methods: Narrative review based on a comprehensive search of the literature.
   Results: It is shown that the pooled efficacy of antidepressants is weak and below the threshold of a minimally clinically important change once publication and reporting biases are considered. Moreover, the small mean difference in symptom reductions relative to placebo is possibly attributable to observer effects in unblinded assessors and patient expectancies. With respect to trial dropout rates, a hard outcome not subjected to observer bias, no difference was observed between antidepressants and placebo. The discontinuation trials on the efficacy of antidepressants in maintenance therapy are systematically flawed, because in these studies, spontaneous remitters are excluded, whereas half of all patients who remitted on antidepressants are abruptly switched to placebo. This can cause a severe withdrawal syndrome that is easily misdiagnosed as a relapse when assessed on subjective symptom rating scales. In accordance, the findings of naturalistic long-term studies suggest that maintenance therapy has no clear benefit, and non-drug users do not show increased recurrence rates. Moreover, a growing body of evidence from hundreds of randomized controlled trials suggests that antidepressants cause suicidality, but this risk is underestimated because data from industry-funded trials are systematically flawed. Unselected,population-wide observational studies indicate that depressive patients who use antidepressants are at an increased risk of suicide and that they have a higher rate of all-cause mortality than matched controls.
   Conclusion: The strong reliance on industry-funded research results in an uncritical approval of antidepressants. Due to several flaws such as publication and reporting bias, unblindingof outcome assessors, concealment and recoding of serious adverse events, the efficacy of antidepressants is systematically overestimated, and harm is systematically underestimated. Therefore, I conclude that antidepressants are largely ineffective and potentially harmful.

AB  - The ability of decision making plays a highly relevant role in our survival, but is adversely affected during the process of aging. The present review aims to provide a better understanding of age-related differences in decision making and the role of cognitive and emotional factors in this context. We reviewed the literature about age-effects on decision-making performance, focusing on decision making under ambiguous and objective risk. In decisions under ambiguous risks, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task, decisions are based on the experiences with consequences. In this case, many articles have attributed age-related impairments in decision making to changes in emotional and somatic reward-and punishment processing. In decisions under objective risks, as measured for example by the Game of Dice Task, decisions can be based on explicit information about risks and consequences. In this case, age-related changes have been attributed mainly to a cognitive decline, particularly impaired executive functions. However, recent findings challenge these conclusions. The present review summarizes neuropsychological and neurophysiological findings of age-related differences in decision making under ambiguous and objective risk. In this context, the relevance of learning, but also of cognitive and emotional contributors - responsible for age-related differences in decision making - are additionally pointed out.

AB  - Background: We carried out a systematic review analyzing the relation between binge eating disorder (BED), a recent addition to the eating disorders in DSM-5, and suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation or attempted and/or committed suicide) by synthesizing the relevant studies' qualitative data.
   Methods: We conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of the literature on PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Search terms were "binge eating disorder" combined with the "AND" Boolean operator and "suicid*."
   Results: The initial search identified 4,014 records, of which 17 research reports met the predefined inclusion criteria and were analyzed. BED was found to be significantly associated with a marked increase in suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation (SI). The presence and severity of BED were found to be relevant predictive factors for suicidality, notably in association with mood disorders and specific psychological features, while a high body mass index (BMI) did not always affect suicidality. BED has usually been associated with suicide risk, particularly when occurring with another psychiatric disorder and/or in an adolescent population.
   Conclusion: Pursuant to these findings, it is necessary to consider both dysfunctional eating behavior and related psychopathological factors that may induce SI and suicidal behavior in BED, aiming to identify patients and subgroups of patients needing greater clinical psychological attention to most effectively prevent and treat suicidality.

AB  - Various therapeutic approaches are available for the treatment of gambling disorder (GD), especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; the most widely used treatment). However, CBT has high dropout and relapse rates as well as non-compliance issues, which may be partly due to resistance to changing core characteristics, such as executive functioning, attention, and emotional regulation abnormalities. Finding new therapeutic approaches to treat GD is thus a key challenge. Cognitive remediation (CR) interventions represent a promising approach to GD management, which has recently been demonstrated to have efficacy for treating other addictive disorders. The objective of this review is to describe the possible benefits of CR interventions for GD management. Two systematic searches in MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases were conducted up until January 2017. Potential neurocognitive targets of CR interventions for GD were reviewed, as is the use and efficacy of such interventions for GD. While there is evidence of several neurocognitive deficits in individuals with GD in terms of impulsive, reflective, and interoceptive processes, the literature on CR interventions is virtually absent. No clinical studies were found in the literature, apart from a trial of a very specific program using Playmancer, a serious videogame, which was tested in cases of bulimia nervosa and GD. However, neurocognitive impairments in individuals with addictive disorders are highly significant, not only affecting quality of life, but also making abstinence and recovery more difficult. Given that CR interventions represent a relatively novel therapeutic approach to addiction and that there is currently a scarcity of studies on clinical populations suffering from GD, further research is needed to examine the potential targets of such interventions and the effectiveness of different training approaches. So far, no consensus has been reached on the optimal parameters of CR interventions (duration, intensity, frequency, group vs. individual, pencil-and-paper vs. computerized delivery, etc.). Although no firm conclusions can be drawn, CR interventions represent a promising adjunct treatment for GD. Such a novel therapy could be associated with common interventions, such as CBT and educational and motivational interventions, in order to make therapies more effective and longer-lasting and to decrease the risk of relapse.

AB  - As poikilothermic vertebrates, fish can experience changes in water temperature, and hence body temperature, as a result of seasonal changes, migration, or efflux of large quantities of effluent into a body of water. Temperature shifts outside of the optimal temperature range for an individual fish species can have negative impacts on the physiology of the animal, including the immune system. As a result, acute or chronic exposure to suboptimal temperatures can impair an organisms' ability to defend against pathogens and thus compromise the overall health of the animal. This review focuses on the advances made towards understanding the impacts of suboptimal temperature on the soluble and cellular mediators of the innate and adaptive immune systems of fishes. Although cold stress can result in varying effects in different fish species, acute and chronic suboptimal temperature exposure generally yield suppressive effects, particularly on adaptive immunity. Knowledge of the effects of environmental temperature on fish species is critical for both the optimal management of wild species and the best management practices for aquaculture species.

AB  - Several mutations in the gene coding for DJ-1 have been associated with early onset forms of parkinsonism. In spite of the massive effort spent by the scientific community in understanding the physiological role of DJ-1, a consensus on what DJ-1 actually does within the cells has not been reached, with several diverse functions proposed. At present, the most accepted function for DJ-1 is a neuronal protective role against oxidative stress. However, how exactly this function is exerted by DJ-1 is not clear. In recent years, novel molecular mechanisms have been suggested that may account for the antioxidant properties of DJ-1. In this review, we critically analyse the experimental evidence, including some very recent findings, supporting the purported neuroprotective role of DJ-1 through different mechanisms linked to oxidative stress handling, as well as the relevance of these processes in the context of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Objective: Light therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment for depression and a range of other neuropsychiatric conditions. Yet, concerns have been raised about the ocular safety of light therapy.
   Method: We conducted the first systematic review into the ocular safety of light therapy. A PubMed search on January 4, 2017, identified 6708 articles, of which 161 were full-text reviewed. In total, 43 articles reporting on ocular complaints and ocular examinations were included in the analyses.
   Results: Ocular complaints, including ocular discomfort and vision problems, were reported in about 0% to 45% of the participants of studies involving light therapy. Based on individual studies, no evident relationship between the occurrence of complaints and light therapy dose was found. There was no evidence for ocular damage due to light therapy, with the exception of one case report that documented the development of a maculopathy in a person treated with the photosensitizing antidepressant clomipramine.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that light therapy is safe for the eyes in physically healthy, unmedicated persons. The ocular safety of light therapy in persons with preexisting ocular abnormalities or increased photosensitivity warrants further study. However, theoretical considerations do not substantiate stringent ocular safety-related contraindications for light therapy.

AB  - Aims and method To review the literature to examine the factors that may be affecting recruitment into psychiatry in the UK. We systematically searched four databases to identify studies from 1974 to 2016 and identified 27 papers that met the specified inclusion criteria.
   Results Most papers (n = 24) were based on questionnaire surveys. The population in all studies comprised of 1879 psychiatrists, 6733 students and 220 746 trainees. About 4-7% of students opt for a career in psychiatry. Enrichment activities helped to attract students more towards psychiatry than just total time spent in the specialty. Job content in terms of the lack of scientific basis, poor prognosis and stigma towards psychiatry, work-related stress and problems with training jobs were common barriers highlighted among students and trainees, affecting recruitment. Job satisfaction and family-friendly status of psychiatry was rated highly by students, with lifestyle factors appearing to be important for trainees who tend to choose psychiatry.
   Clinical implications Negative attitudes and stigma towards psychiatry continue to persist. Teaching and training in psychiatry needs rethinking to improve student experience and recruitment into the specialty.

AB  - Background: Workplace violence (WPV) against healthcare workers (HCWs) employed in psychiatric inpatient wards is a serious occupational issue that involves both staff and patients; the consequences of WPV may include increased service costs and lower standards of care. The purpose of this review was to evaluate which topics have been focused on in the literature and which are new in approaching the concern of patient violence against HCWs employed in psychiatric inpatient wards, in the past 20 years.
   Methods: We searched for publications in PubMed and Web of Science using selected keywords. Each article was reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following four categories based on its subject matter: risk assessment, risk management, occurrence rates, and physical/nonphysical consequences.
   Results: Our search resulted in a total of 64 publications that matched our inclusion criteria. The topics discussed, in order of frequency (from highest to lowest), were as follows: "risk assessment," "risk management," "occurrence rates," and "physical/nonphysical consequences. "Schizophrenia, young age, alcohol use, drug misuse, a history of violence, and hostile-dominant interpersonal styles were found to be the predictors of patients' violence.
   Conclusion: Risk assessment of violence by patients appeared the way to effectively minimize the occurrence of WPV and, consequently, to better protect mental HCWs. We found paucity of data regarding psychologic sequelae of WPV. According to these findings, we suggest the need to better investigate the psychologic consequences of WPV, with the aim of checking the effective interventions to assist HCW victims of violence and to prevent psychologic illness.

AB  - Work stress can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by 50%, with increasing research focusing on the underlying mechanisms responsible for these associations. Our meta-analysis assessed the associations of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) workplace stress model with indices of cardiovascular disease. The search term `effort*reward"imbalance produced 22 papers (129 associations, N = 93,817) meeting inclusion criteria. Greater ERI was most associated with increased hypertension (r = 0.26, p < 0.001, N = 1180), intima media thickness (r = 0.23, p < .001, N = 828) and fibrinogen (r = 0.13, p = 0.03, N = 4315). Trait over-commitment was most associated with increased hypertension (r = 0.24, p = 0.02, N = 899) and intima media thickness (r = 0.19, p = 0.02, N = 828). Interventions aimed at reducing the impact of ERI and over-commitment on cardiovascular disease should consider concurrently assessing changes in physiological markers of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Facial emotion perception is a fundamental social competency relying on a specialised, yet distributed, neural network. This review aimed to determine whether patients with epilepsy have facial emotion perception accuracy impairments overall, or for a subset of emotions (anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, fear, and surprise), and the relationship to epilepsy type, demographic/treatment variables, and brain organisation. Database searches used PRISMA guidelines with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirty included studies assessed patients with temporal lobe (TLE; n = 709), frontocentral (FCE; n = 22), and genetic generalised (GGE; n = 48) epilepsy. Large deficits emerged in patients with epilepsy compared to controls (n = 746; Hedges' g = 0.908-1.076). Patients with TLE were significantly impaired on all emotions except surprise; patients with GGE were significantly impaired in anger, disgust, and fear perception. Meta-regression of patients with TLE revealed younger age at testing was associated with lower accuracy. This review provides evidence for marked global deficits of emotion perception in epilepsy, with differential emotion-specific impairment patterns in patients with TLE and GGE.

AB  - Due to their prevalence, hallucinations are considered as one of the most frequent psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These psychotic manifestations reduce patients' well-being, increase the burden of caregivers, contribute to early institutionalization, and are related with the course of cognitive decline in AD. Considering their consequences, we provide a comprehensive account of the current state of knowledge about the prevalence and characteristics of hallucinations in AD. We propose a comprehensive and testable theoretical model about hallucinations in AD: the ALZHA (ALZheimer and HAllucinations) model. In this model, neurological, genetic, cognitive, affective, and iatrogenic factors associated with hallucinations in AD are highlighted. According to the ALZHA model, hallucinations in AD first involve trait markers (i.e., cognitive deficits, neurological deficits, genetic predisposition and/or sensory deficits) to which state markers that may trigger these experiences are added (e.g., psychological distress and/or iatrogenic factors). Finally, we provide recommendations for assessment and management of these psychotic manifestations in AD, with the aim to benefit patients, caregivers, and health professionals.

AB  - The recent crisis in the Middle East has prompted the exodus of millions of refugees from the region who are at present seeking shelter across Europe and in the United States. Among the most immediate needs of refugees upon arrival in a host country is health care, and it is one of the most sustained interactions they experience. Home visits are a common form of primary care for refugees. The authors review the literature to identify themes related to challenges and strategies for providing home based primary care to refugees. The literature review was performed by searching cross-disciplinary databases utilizing Onesearch, but focusing primarily on results produced through CINAHL, EBSCOHOST, and Pub Med databases. To maximize the number of studies included, there was no time frame placed upon publication dates of articles within the search. A total of 55 articles were included in this paper.

AB  - Decoding affective meaning from sensory information is central to accurate and adaptive behavior in many natural and social contexts. Human vocalizations (speech and non-speech), environmental sounds (e.g. thunder, noise, or animal sounds) and human-produced sounds (e.g. technical sounds or music) can carry a wealth of important aversive, threatening, appealing, or pleasurable affective information that sometimes 'implicitly influences and guides our behavior. A deficit in processing such affective information is detrimental to adaptive environmental behavior, psychological well-being, and social interactive abilities. These deficits can originate from a diversity of psychiatric and neurological disorders, and are associated with neural dysfunctions across largely distributed brain networks. Recent neuroimaging studies in psychiatric and neurological patients outline the cortical and subcortical neurocircuitry of the complimentary and differential functional roles for affective sound processing. This points to and confirms a recently proposed distributed network rather than a single brain region underlying affective sound processing, and highlights the notion of a multi-functional process that can be differentially impaired in clinical disorders.

AB  - Introduction Exposure to armed conflict has manifold implications for both military and civilian populations. Prenatal stress has detrimental effects on both obstetric outcomes, fetal development and the development of an individual later in life. As well as causing stress to the mother, armed conflicts can decimate local infrastructures making it increasingly difficult to access antenatal and general healthcare. The present review is particularly salient in light of the many ongoing current conflicts. It examines the impacts of exposure to armed conflicts on the pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods A thorough literature search was carried out on three databases using MeSH and truncation terms. 13 studies were included in the final analysis relating to mothers exposed to armed conflicts since 1990.
   Results The studies include data from 1 172 151 patients: mothers from Libya, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Israel, Palestine, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, Nepal, Somalia, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. There is evidence of an increased risk of mothers giving birth to babies of low birth weight as reported in nine included studies. All have a degree of bias, with four at lower and five at higher risk of bias, either not adjusting for confounders or not employing robust measures of exposure to conflict. Further evidence suggested an increase in the incidence of miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, congenital abnormalities, miscarriage and premature rupture of membranes among mothers exposed to armed conflict.
   Conclusion Despite the varying degrees of bias which must be considered for the available evidence, the data with the lowest risk of bias suggest a relationship between exposure to armed conflict and low birth weight. In light of the current level of displacement experienced by such populations, the identification of pregnancies at risk could improve the efficacy of antenatal care. Clinicians should consider additional ultrasound scanning where appropriate to monitor for restricted growth in such pregnancies.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are highly debilitating conditions characterised primarily by progressive neuronal loss and impairment of the nervous system. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common of these disorders, affecting 1-2% of the population above the age of 65. Although the underlying mechanisms of PD have been extensively studied, we still lack a full understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the disease. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo models currently used are able to only partially recapitulate the typical phenotypes of the disease. Here, we review various cell culture models currently used to study the molecular basis of PD, with a focus on alpha-synuclein-associated molecular pathologies. We also discuss how different cell models may constitute powerful tools for high-throughput screening of molecules capable of modulating alpha-synuclein toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The locus coeruleus (LC), the major origin of noradrenergic modulation of the central nervous system, innervates extensive areas throughout the brain and is implicated in a variety of autonomic and cognitive functions. Alterations in the LC-noradrenergic system have been associated with healthy ageing and neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and depression. The last decade has seen advances in imaging the structure and function of the LC, and this paper systematically reviews the methodology and outcomes of sixty-nine structural and functional MRI studies of the LC in humans. Structural MRI studies consistently showed lower LC signal intensity and volume in clinical groups compared to healthy controls. Within functional studies, the LC was activated by a variety of tasks/stimuli and had functional connectivity to a range of brain regions. However, reported functional LC location coordinates were widely distributed compared to previously published neuroanatomical locations. Methodological and demographic factors potentially contributing to these differences are discussed, together with recommendations to optimize the reliability and validity of future LC imaging studies.

AB  - To systematically review studies of health promotion intervention in the police force. Four databases were searched for articles reporting on prepost single and multigroup studies in police officers and trainees. Data were extracted and bias assessed to evaluate study characteristics, intervention design and the impact of interventions on health. Database searching identified 25 articles reporting on 21 studies relevant to the aims of this review. Few studies (n=3) were of long duration (>= 6 months). Nine of 21 studies evaluated structured physical activity and/or diet programmes only, 5 studies used education and behaviour change support-only interventions, 5 combined structured programmes with education and behaviour change support, and 2 studies used computer prompts to minimise sedentary behaviour. A wide array of lifestyle behaviour and health outcomes was measured, with 11/13 multigroup and 8/8 single-group studies reporting beneficial impacts on outcomes. High risk of bias was evident across most studies. In those with the lowest risk of bias (n=2), a large effect on blood pressure and small effects on diet, sleep quality, stress and tobacco use, were reported. Health promotion interventions can impact beneficially on health of the police force, particularly blood pressure, diet, sleep, stress and tobacco use. Limited reporting made comparison of findings challenging. Combined structured programmes with education and behaviour change support and programmes including peer support resulted in the most impact on health-related outcomes.

AB  - In most countries, immersion represents the second most common cause of accidental death in children and the third in adults. Between 2010 and 2013, 561 deaths worldwide involving recreational divers were recorded by the Divers Alert Network. Consequently, there is no room for complacency when diving. Being lost at sea is a diver's worst nightmare. In 2006, a diver was lost at sea off the coast of New Zealand for 75 hours. It is unprecedented that, after such a long time immersed in temperate (16-17 degrees C) waters, he was found and survived. His case is presented and utilised to illustrate the many physiological and psychological factors involved in prolonged immersion and what might determine survival under such circumstances. We also briefly review options for enhancing diver location at sea and a few issues related to search and rescue operations are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Rural-to-urban migration within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and migration from one LMIC to another, are prevalent forms of international migration. Migration may be associated with adverse mental health outcomes. The aim of the current study is to systematically review the literature on migration and mental health between and within LMICs. Methods: This systematic review of PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and PILOTS, identified 2,818 total records published between 1991 and 2016, with 139 of these assessed for eligibility. Two authors reviewed full text to assess if they met inclusion criteria, extracted data, and applied a quality assessment to all included studies. Results: The search identified 37 articles that met the inclusion criteria, based on 28 separate studies. All studies apart from one were cross-sectional studies, and studies utilized a range of sampling methods. In all, 19 of these studies were conducted in China. Studies addressed a range of mental health outcomes, and variation in prevalence was reported. Research questions addressed determinants of mental health outcomes, including analysis of risk and protective factors, such as social, cultural, and economic determinants; migration related risk factors; and substance use. Conclusions: Limitations in study design and methodological rigor of studies indicate a limited evidence base concerning migration and mental health in LMICs. Expansion of research to different regions, utilization of adapted and validated measurement instruments, and longitudinal research could significantly strengthen the evidence base.

AB  - Taurine is a highly abundant "amino acid" in the brain. Despite the potential neuroactive role of taurine in vertebrates has long been recognized, the underlying molecular mechanisms related to its pleiotropic effects in the brain remain poorly understood. Due to the genetic tractability, rich behavioral repertoire, neurochemical conservation, and small size, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a powerful candidate for neuropsychopharmacology investigation and in vivo drug screening. Here, we summarize the main physiological roles of taurine in mammals, including neuromodulation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and antioxidant action. In this context, we also highlight how zebrafish models of brain disorders may present interesting approaches to assess molecular mechanisms underlying positive effects of taurine in the brain. Finally, we outline recent advances in zebrafish drug screening that significantly improve neuropsychiatric translational researches and small molecule screens.

   Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies which have used point-light displays to present whole-body motion to patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, to evaluate the magnitude of differences between these groups in biological motion processing.
   Method: Firstly, relevant publications were identified by a systematic search of Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Secondly, we excluded non-relevant studies for the meta-analysis according to our exclusion criteria. Effect sizes were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD).
   Results: 15 papers reporting results of 14 different experiments with 571 patients and 482 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The results for the general biological motion perception analysis revealed that patients with schizophrenia (compared with healthy controls) present reduced biological motion processing capacity with the effect size (SMD) of 0.66 (95% CI,-0.79 to -0.54; p < 0.001). The results for the specific biological motion-based tasks were also statistically significant with SMD of 0.72 for Basic Biological Motion task (95% CI: -0.94 to -0.51; p < 0.001) and SMD of 0.61 for Emotion in Biological Motion task, (95% CI:-0.79 to-0.43; p < 0.001) respectively.
   Conclusion: The findings from our meta-analysis highlight abnormalities in general and specific domains of biological motion perception in schizophrenia patients as compared with healthy controls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology that is thought to be caused by a complex combination of environmental and/or genetic factors. Air pollution exposure is linked to numerous adverse effects on human health, including brain inflammation and oxidative stress, processes that are believed to contribute to the development and progression of PD. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the epidemiology of air pollution and PD, including evidence of the effects of various pollutants (ozone, PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5-10, NOx, NO2, CO, traffic air pollution, second-hand smoking) on PD risk. Based on this evidence, promising opportunities for future research are outlined, including: (1) studies of smaller particle sizes that cross the blood-brain barrier, (2) studies of the effects of air pollution on PD mortality and/or progression; (3) studies of interactions of air pollution with gene environment and other environmental factors.

AB  - Disruption of oxidant/anti-oxidant ratio as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These stresses can lead to impairments in brain functions progressively leading to neuronal inflammation followed by neuronal cell death. Moreover, the cellular stresses are interlinked leading us to the conclusion that protein misfolding, oxidative stress and apoptosis are intricately intertwined events requiring further research into their mechanistic and physiological pathways. These pathways can be targeted by using different therapeutic interventions like anti-oxidants, sigma-1 receptor agonists and gene therapy to treat the neurodegenerative course of schizophrenia. We have also put empahsis on use of synthetic and natural ER stress inhibitors like 4-phenylbutyrate or salubrinal for the treatment of this disorder. This would provide an opportunity to create new therapeutic benchmarks in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.

AB  - Alcohol (ethanol) disturbs cognitive functions including learning and memory in humans, non-human primates, and laboratory animals such as rodents. As studied in animals, cellular mechanisms for learning and memory include bidirectional synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression (LTD), primarily in the hippocampus. Most of the research in the field of alcohol has analyzed the effects of ethanol on LTP; however, with recent advances in the understanding of the physiological role of LTD in learning and memory, some authors have examined the effects of ethanol exposure on this particular signal. In the present review, I will focus on hippocampal LTD recorded in rodents and the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on this signal. A synthesis of the findings indicates that prenatal ethanol exposure disturbs LTD concurrently with LTP in offspring and that both glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmissions are altered and contribute to LTD disturbances. Although the ultimate mode of action of ethanol on these two transmitter systems is not yet clear, novel suggestions have recently appeared in the literature.

AB  - In response to U.S. federal mandates to increase the presence of underrepresented populations in prevention research, investigators have increasingly focused on using culturally sensitive research practices. However, scholars have rarely discussed these practices in terms of a larger culturally sensitive framework. Further, while the literature has explored how culturally sensitive approaches can be employed in a variety of methods, there has been little examination of how to incorporate such approaches into experimental designs. In this paper, we explain how we incorporated a culturally sensitive framework in a cluster randomized field trial with over 3000 predominantly low-income Latino families, utilizing an intervention designed to improve social relations and enhance family functioning. We offer conceptual and practical examples to guide other researchers who want to adopt a similar approach in their research designs. In addition, we discuss the benefits of forging local partnerships throughout the research process to ensure respect for racial and ethnic minorities participating in social and behavioral experimental studies. We conclude with practical considerations for utilizing a culturally sensitive framework to advance prevention programs, policies, and practices among underrepresented groups in order to achieve the ultimate goal of addressing the traditional underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in research.

KW  - RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT
AB  - Objective: Depression screening among children and adolescents is controversial. In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force first recommended routine depression screening for adolescents, and this recommendation was reiterated in 2016. However, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of screening were identified in the original 2009 systematic review or in an updated review through February 2015. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a current evaluation to determine whether there is evidence from RCTs that depression screening in childhood and adolescence improves depression outcomes.
   Method: Data sources included the MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL and LILACS databases searched February 2, 2017. Eligible studies had to be RCTs that compared depression outcomes between children or adolescents aged 6 to 18 years who underwent depression screening and those who did not.
   Results: Of 552 unique title/abstracts, none received full-text review. No RCTs that investigated the effects of screening on depression outcomes in children or adolescents were identified.
   Conclusions: There is no direct RCT evidence that supports depression screening among children and adolescents. Groups that consider recommending screening should carefully consider potential harms, as well as the use of scarce health resources, that would occur with the implementation of screening programs.

   Recent Findings With regard to AAI within the military, several canine interaction programs have been utilized to assist service members in coping with various issues. Therapy dogs have been deployed with Combat-Operational Stress Control units; they have been integrated into medical clinics and behavioral health treatment programs in garrison; and policy has been developed to address the use of therapy animals in military treatment facilities. General research in AAI has demonstrated efficacy for certain presenting issues (stress management, trauma, autism spectrum disorder) and specific populations (children, the elderly, acute care patients). Overall trends in research include calls for increased consideration for animal welfare in AAI and increased rigor in research methodology.
   Summary Current research supports the structured use of therapy dogs in the treatment of various disorders and with specific populations, including military service members and veterans; however, the need for additional research with rigorous methodology remains.

AB  - Background. Efforts to reduce expensive health service utilization, contain costs, improve health outcomes, and address the social determinants of health require research that demonstrates the economic value of health services in population health across a variety of settings. Social workers are an integral part of the US health care system, yet the specific contributions of social work to health and cost-containment outcomes are unknown. The social work profession's person-in-environment framework and unique skillset, particularly around addressing social determinants of health, hold promise for improving health and cost outcomes.
   Objectives. To systematically review international studies of the effect of social work-involved health services on health and economic outcomes.
   Search Methods. We searched 4 databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index) by using "social work" AND "cost" and "health" for trials published from 1990 to 2017.
   Selection Criteria. Abstract review was followed by full-text review of all studies meeting inclusion criteria (social work services, physical health, and cost outcomes).
   Data Collection and Analysis. Of the 831 abstracts found, 51 (6.1%) met criteria. Full text review yielded 16 studies involving more than 16 000 participants, including pregnant and pediatric patients, vulnerable low-income adults, and geriatric patients. We examined study quality, health and utilization outcomes, and cost outcomes.
   Main Results. Average study quality was fair. Studies of 7 social workled services scored higher on quality ratings than 9 studies of social workers as team members. Most studies showed positive effects on health and service utilization; cost-savings were consistent across nearly all studies.
   Conclusions. Despite positive overall effects on outcomes, variability in study methods, health problems, and cost analyses render generalizations difficult. Controlled hypothesis-driven trials are needed to examine the health and cost effects of specific services delivered by social workers independently and through interprofessional team-based care.
   Public Health Implications. The economic and health benefits reported in these studies suggest that the broad health perspective taken by the social work profession for patient, personal, and environmental needs may be particularly valuable for achieving goals of cost containment, prevention, and population health. Novel approaches that move beyond cost savings to articulate the specific value-added of social work are much needed. As health service delivery focuses increasingly on interprofessional training, practice, and integrated care, more research testing the impact of social work prevention and intervention efforts on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations while also measuring societal costs and benefits is essential.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressively distributed Lewy pathology and neurodegeneration. The motor symptoms of clinical Parkinson's disease (cPD) are unequivocally linked to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Several features of these neurons appear to make them selectively vulnerable to factors thought to cause cPD, like aging, genetic mutations and environmental toxins. Among these features, Ca2+ entry through Cavl channels is particularly amenable to pharmacotherapy in early stage cPD patients. This review outlines the linkage between these channels, mitochondrial oxidant stress and cPD pathogenesis. It also summarizes considerations that went into the design and execution of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial with an inhibitor of these channels - isradipine.

AB  - Objective: The current review discusses neuropsychological profiles and the longitudinal course of cognitive dysfunction in Late Onset Schizophrenia (LOS) and Very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP), and attempts to clarify its neurobiological underpinnings.
   Method: A systematic literature search resulted in 29 publications describing original research on the neu- ropsychology of LOS/VLOSLP and 46 studies focussing on neurobiology.
   Results: Although mildly progressive cognitive impairment is usually present, only a subgroup of LOS/VLOSLP develops dementia during a 10-year follow-up succeeding the onset of psychosis. This coincides with the absence of neuropathological evidence for neurodegeneration in many cases. Cognitive deterioration is characterized by deficits in (working) memory, language, psychomotor speed and executive functioning. Underlying neurobiological changes encompass white matter pathology, increased ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) with coinciding atrophy and hypo-metabolism of frontal, temporal and subcortical areas.
   Conclusions: Multiple changes in neurobiology and cognition contributing to LOS/VLOSLP may reflect stress related accelerated brain aging rather than neurodegenerative pathology. Their involvement in the onset of illness, however, might be inversely proportional to pre-existing (psychosocial and/or genetic) vulnerability to psychosis.

AB  - Purpose of review Mangroves are under increasing heavy metal (HM) pollution pressure from human activities because of the rapid industrialization and urbanization in coastal areas. Field and laboratory experiments showed that the tolerance of mangrove plants to HM stress is normally a mixture of metal avoidance and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, related studies during the past few decades on the accumulation and tolerance of mangrove to HMs have been synthesized.
   Recent findings In mangroves, metal accumulation mainly occurred at the root level with restricted transport to the aerial portions of the plant. The common founded HMs, such as copper, zinc, cadmium, chromium, and mercury, generally showed high bioconcentration factor in roots, while the concentration factors for these metals in leaves were usually much lower than one. The limited translocation of the toxic metals to the aerial parts renders the mangrove plants a high endurance ability to high levels of HM stress. To protect the cellular components from oxidative damage by HMs, mangroves have developed both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant mechanisms to scavenge the ROS. In some circumstances, the changes of antioxidative enzyme activity were usually in accordance with the changes of toxic metal concentrations in plant tissues. However, the responses of antioxidative enzymes in mangroves to HM stress varied with plant species, metal type, and concentration, as well as the duration of the treatment time.
   Summary More toxicity tests are needed with early life stages of mangroves to determine threshold effect concentrations under more realistic conditions.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric syndrome with complex etiology. Studies aiming to explore genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers of PTSD have been increasing. However, the results are limited and highly heterogeneous. To understand the genetic study status of PTSD and explore more reliable candidates, we obtained 105 PTSD related genetic studies by comprehensively literature searching and filtering 1762 studies. Detailed phenotype and sample information for each study and association results for each genetic marker were extracted. Based on the extracted data, we reviewed the PTSD genetic research status and further conducted bioinformatics analyses for the genetic data. Our analyses summarized the landscape of PTSD genetic studies, identified the genes with most genetic evidence, discovered the biological function of the candidate variants/genes and enlarged the overall candidates for future investigations. All the data were stored in the PTSDgene database (http://ptsdgene.psych.ac.cn). We hope PTSDgene could be a platform for the rapid growth of PTSD genetic data and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PTSD.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. The reason for the death of these neurons is unclear; however, studies have demonstrated the potential involvement of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, alpha-synuclein or dopamine levels in contributing to cellular oxidative stress as well as PD symptoms. Even though those papers had separately described the individual roles of each element leading to neurodegeneration, recent publications suggest that neurodegeneration is the product of various cellular interactions. This review discusses the role of oxidative stress in mediating separate pathological events that together, ultimately result in cell death in PD. Understanding the multi-faceted relationships between these events, with oxidative stress as a common denominator underlying these processes, is needed for developing better therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The present study is focused on a review of the current state of investigating music-evoked emotions experimentally, theoretically and with respect to their therapeutic potentials. After a concise historical overview and a schematic of the hearing mechanisms, experimental studies on music listeners and on music performers are discussed, starting with the presentation of characteristic musical stimuli and the basic features of tomographic imaging of emotional activation in the brain, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), which offer high spatial resolution in the millimeter range. The progress in correlating activation imaging in the brain to the psychological understanding of music-evoked emotion is demonstrated and some prospects for future research are outlined. Research in psychoneuroendocrinology and molecular markers is reviewed in the context of music-evoked emotions and the results indicate that the research in this area should be intensified. An assessment of studies involving measuring techniques with high temporal resolution down to the 10ms range, as, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), event-related brain potentials (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), skin conductance response (SCR), finger temperature, and goose bump development (piloerection) can yield information on the dynamics and kinetics of emotion. Genetic investigations reviewed suggest the heredity transmission of a predilection for music. Theoretical approaches to musical emotion are directed to a unified model for experimental neurological evidence and aesthetic judgment. Finally, the reports on musical therapy are briefly outlined. The study concludes with an outlook on emerging technologies and future research fields.

AB  - Apathy is one of the most frequent non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) that can lead to a whole range of deleterious outcomes. In 2006, Levy and Dubois proposed a model that distinguishes three different apathy aetiologies in PD divided into three subtypes of disrupted processing: "emotional-affective," "cognitive," and "auto-activation." These three dimensions associated with dopamine depletion present in the pathology would lead to the emergence of apathy in PD. The aim of this mini-review was to describe and discuss studies that have explore links between apathy and the three subtypes of disrupted processing proposed by Levy and Dubois (2006) and as well as the links between these dimensions and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease. The lack of consensus regarding the emotional-affective correlates of apathy and the lack of evidence supporting the hypothesis of the auto-activation deficit, do not clearly confirm the validity of Levy and Dubois's model. Furthermore, the suggested association between dopaminergic depletion and apathy must also be clarified.

AB  - Background: The objective of this systematic review was to examine for the first time the associations between sleep duration and a broad range of health indicators in children aged 0 to 4 years.
   Methods: Electronic databases were searched with no limits on date or study design. Included studies (published in English or French) were peer-reviewed and met the a priori determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1 month to 4.99 years), intervention/exposure/comparator (various sleep durations), and outcome criteria (adiposity, emotional regulation, cognitive development, motor development, growth, cardiometabolic health, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, quality of life/well-being, and risks/injuries). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Due to high levels of heterogeneity across studies, narrative syntheses were employed.
   Results: A total of 69 articles/studies (62 unique samples) met inclusion criteria. Data across studies included 148,524 unique participants from 23 countries. The study designs were randomized trials (n = 3), non-randomized interventions (n = 1), longitudinal studies (n = 16), cross-sectional studies (n = 42), or longitudinal studies that also reported cross-sectional analyses (n = 7). Sleep duration was assessed by parental report in 70% of studies (n = 48) and was measured objectively (or both objectively and subjectively) in 30% of studies (n = 21). Overall, shorter sleep duration was associated with higher adiposity (20/31 studies), poorer emotional regulation (13/25 studies), impaired growth (2/2 studies), more screen time (5/5 studies), and higher risk of injuries (2/3 studies). The evidence related to cognitive development, motor development, physical activity, and quality of life/well-being was less clear, with no indicator showing consistent associations. No studies examined the association between sleep duration and cardiometabolic biomarkers in children aged 0 to 4 years. The quality of evidence ranged from "very low" to "high" across study designs and health indicators.
   Conclusions: Despite important limitations in the available evidence, longer sleep duration was generally associated with better body composition, emotional regulation, and growth in children aged 0 to 4 years. Shorter sleep duration was also associated with longer screen time use and more injuries. Better-quality studies with stronger research designs that can provide information on dose-response relationships are needed to inform contemporary sleep duration recommendations.

AB  - Background: A recent review highlighted important relationships between combinations of movement behaviours (i.e., sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity) and health indicators among school-aged children and youth (aged 5-17 years). It is unclear whether similar relationships exist in younger children. Therefore, this review sought to examine the relationships between combinations of movement behaviours and health indicators in the early years (1.00 month to 4.99 years).
   Methods: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus were searched for relevant studies up to November 2016, with no date or study design limits. Included studies met the a priori-determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1.00 month to 4.99 years), intervention (combination of >= 2 movement behaviours [ i.e., sleep and sedentary behaviour; sleep and physical activity; sedentary behaviour and physical activity; and sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity]), comparator (various levels and combinations of movement behaviours), and health outcome/indicator (Critical: adiposity, motor development, psychosocial health/emotional regulation, cognitive development, fitness, and growth; Important: bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, and risks). For each health indicator, quality of evidence was assessed by study design using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
   Results: Ten articles (n = 7436 participants; n = 5 countries) were included. Across observational and experimental study designs, the most ideal combinations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity were: favourably associated with motor development and fitness among preschool-aged children (3.00 to 4.99 years); both favourably and not associated with adiposity among toddlers (1.10 to 2.99 years) and preschool-aged children; and not associated with growth among toddlers and preschool-aged children. The most ideal combinations of sleep and sedentary behaviour were favourably associated with adiposity among infants (1.00 month to 1.00 years) and toddlers. Quality of evidence ranged from "very low" to "moderate".
   Conclusions: The most ideal combinations of movement behaviours (e.g., high sleep, low sedentary behaviour, high physical activity) may be important for optimal health in the early years. Findings can help inform movement behaviour guidelines for the early years. Given the limited evidence, future research is needed to determine the ideal distribution of daily movement behaviours for optimal health throughout the early years.

AB  - Cholesterol is a critical component ofmembrane bilayers where it plays key structural and functional roles by regulating the activity of diverse signaling platforms and pathways. Particularly enriched in brain, cholesterol homeostasis in this organ is singular with respect to other tissues and exhibits a heterogeneous regulation in distinct brain cell populations. Due to the key role of cholesterol in brain physiology and function, alterations in cholesterol homeostasis and levels have been linked to brain diseases and neurodegeneration. In the case of Alzheimer disease (AD), however, this association remains unclear with evidence indicating that either increased or decreased total brain cholesterol levels contribute to this major neurodegenerative disease. Here, rather than analyzing the role of total cholesterol levels in neurodegeneration, we focus on the contribution of intracellular cholesterol pools, particularly in endolysosomes and mitochondria through its trafficking via specialized membrane domains delineated by the contacts between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, in the onset of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease as well as in lysosomal disorders like Niemann-Pick type C disease. We dissect molecular events associated with intracellular cholesterol accumulation, especially in mitochondria, an event that results in impaired mitochondrial antioxidant defense and function. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the distribution of cholesterol in intracellular compartments may shed light on the role of cholesterol homeostasis disruption in neurodegeneration and may pave the way for specific intervention opportunities.

AB  - Economic choice behavior entails the computation and comparison of subjective values. A central contribution of neuroeconomics has been to show that subjective values are represented explicitly at the neuronal level. With this result at hand, the field has increasingly focused on the difficult question of where in the brain and how exactly subjective values are compared to make a decision. Here, we review a broad range of experimental and theoretical results suggesting that good-based decisions are generated in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The main lines of evidence supporting this proposal include the fact that goal-directed behavior is specifically disrupted by OFC lesions, the fact that different groups of neurons in this area encode the input and the output of the decision process, the fact that activity fluctuations in each of these cell groups correlate with choice variability, and the fact that these groups of neurons are computationally sufficient to generate decisions. Results from other brain regions are consistent with the idea that good-based decisions take place in OFC and indicate that value signals inform a variety of mental functions. We also contrast the present proposal with other leading models for the neural mechanisms of economic decisions. Finally, we indicate open questions and suggest possible directions for future research.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive movement neurodegenerative disease associated with a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, is thought to play an important role in dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases are multi-subunit enzymatic complexes that generate reactive oxygen species as their primary function. Increased immunoreactivities for the NADPH oxidases catalytic subunits Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4 have been reported in the brain of PD patients. Furthermore, knockout or genetic inactivation of NADPH oxidases exert a neuroprotective effect and reduce detrimental aspects of pathology in experimental models of the disease. However, the connections between NADPH oxidases and the biological processes believed to contribute to neuronal death are not well known. This review provides a comprehensive summary of our current understanding about expression and physiological function of NADPH oxidases in neurons, microglia and astrocytes and their pathophysiological roles in PD. It summarizes the findings supporting the role of both microglial and neuronal NADPH oxidases in cellular disturbances associated with PD such as neuroinflammation, alpha-synuclein accumulation, mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction or disruption of the autophagy-lysosome system. Furthermore, this review highlights different steps that are essential for NADPH oxidases enzymatic activity and pinpoints major obstacles to overcome for the development of effective NADPH oxidases inhibitors for PD.

AB  - Background: Facilitation of service user participation in the co-production of mental healthcare planning and service delivery is an integral component of contemporary mental health policy and clinical guidelines. However, many service users continue to experience exclusion from the planning of their care. This review synthesizes qualitative research about participation in mental healthcare and articulates essential processes that enable service user participation in mental health care.
   Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed qualitative studies, published between 2000 and 2015, examining participation in mental health care. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist was used to assess the quality of each included study. Constant comparison was used to identify similar constructs across several studies, which were then abstracted into thematic constructs.
   Results: The synthesis resulted in the identification of six principal themes, which articulate key processes that facilitate service user participation in mental healthcare. These themes included: exercising influence; tokenism; sharing knowledge; lacking capacity; respect; and empathy.
   Conclusions: This meta-synthesis demonstrates that service user participation in mental healthcare remains a policy aspiration, which generally has not been translated into clinical practice. The continued lack of impact on policy on the delivery of mental healthcare suggests that change may have to be community driven. Systemic service user advocacy groups could contribute critically to promoting authentic service user participation in the co-production of mental health services.

AB  - Neurodegenerative processes encompass a large variety of diseases with different pathological patterns and clinical presentation such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Genetic mutations have a known causative role, but the majority of cases are likely to be probably caused by a complex gene-environment interaction. Exposure to metals has been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress in brain cells leading to cell death and neurodegeneration. Neurotoxicity of metals has been demonstrated by several in vitro and in vivo experimental studies and it is likely that each metal could be toxic through specific pathways.
   The possible pathogenic role of different metals has been supported by some epidemiological evidences coming from occupational and ecological studies. In order to assess the possible association between metals and neurodegenerative disorders, several case-control studies have also been carried out evaluating the metals concentration in different biological specimens such as blood/serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nail and hair, often reporting conflicting results.
   This review provides an overview of our current knowledge on the possible association between metals and ALS, AD and PD as main neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the mode of implementation, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and the factors influencing uptake and sustainability of collaborative care for psychiatric disorders in older adults.
   Design: Systematic review.
   Setting: Primary care, home health care, seniors' residence, medical inpatient and outpatient.
   Participants: Studies with a mean sample age of 60 years and older.
   Intervention: Collaborative care for psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched up until October 2016. Individual randomized controlled trials and cohort, case-control, and health service evaluation studies were selected, and relevant data were extracted for qualitative synthesis.
   Results: Of the 552 records identified, 53 records (from 29 studies) were included. Very few studies evaluated psychiatric disorders other than depression. The mode of implementation differed based on the setting, with beneficial use of telemedicine. Clinical outcomes for depression were significantly better compared with usual care across settings. In depression, there is some evidence for cost-effectiveness. There is limited evidence for improved dementia care and outcomes using collaborative care. There is a lack of evidence for benefit in disorders other than depression or in settings such as home health care and general acute inpatients. Attitudes and skill of primary care staff, availability of resources, and organizational support are some of the factors influencing uptake and implementation.
   Conclusions: Collaborative care for depressive disorders is feasible and beneficial among older adults in diverse settings. There is a paucity of studies on collaborative care in conditions other than depression or in settings other than primary care, indicating the need for further evaluation.

AB  - Introduction: Italy is the only country in the world to have closed forensic psychiatric hospitals and converted to fully-residential services. The international interest around this reform has not been matched by research. This scoping review aims to report the determinants of the reform, the most updated information on how the system operates, its benefits and its challenges. We further aim to discuss the implications for policy, research and practice.
   Methods: 1. Selection of relevant sources through electronic search on four databases, Google, relevant printed materials and personal communication with practitioners currently working in REMS. 2. Study quality monitoring. 3. Data extraction onto NVivo 4. Data synthesis through content analysis.
   Results: 43 papers were selected for inclusion in our review. Two main themes were identified: 1. Historical chronology of the closure of forensic psychiatric hospitals; 2. The current model of residential forensic psychiatric care.
   Conclusions: The closing down of Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals represented a fundamental step for human rights. Further work is required to improve the current service, including potential reforming of the penal code, improved referral/admission processes and consistent monitoring to reduce service inequality across regions. Further research is crucial to test the effectiveness of the Italian model of care against traditional ones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In spite of considerable advances in understanding the neural underpinnings of SUDs, therapeutic options remain limited. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as an innovative, safe and cost-effective treatment for some SUDs. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) influences neural activity in the short and long term by mechanisms involving neuroplasticity both locally, under the stimulating coil, and at the network level, throughout the brain. The long-term neurophysiological changes induced by rTMS have the potential to affect behaviours relating to drug craving, intake and relapse. Here, we review TMS mechanisms and evidence that rTMS is opening new avenues in addiction treatments.

AB  - This narrative review is based on a literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO for research on preterm newborn pain published during the last ten years. The high prevalence of painful procedures being performed with preterm newborns without analgesia (79%), with a median of 75 painful procedures being received during hospitalization and as many as 51 painful procedures per day highlights the importance of this problem. This review covers the pain assessments that have been developed, the short-term effects of the painful procedures, the longer-term developmental outcomes and the pharmacological and alternative therapies that have been researched. The most immediate effects reported for repeated painful procedures include increased heart rate, oxidative stress and cortisol as well as decreased vagal activity. Lower body weight and head circumference have been noted at 32 weeks gestation. Blunted cortisol reactivity to stressors has been reported for three-month-olds and thinner gray matter in 21 of 66 cerebral regions and motor and cognitive developmental delays have been noted as early as eight months. Longer-term outcomes have been reported at school age including less cortical thickness, lower vagal activity, delayed visual perceptual development, lower IQs and internalizing behavior. Pharmacological interventions and their side effects and non-pharmacological therapies are also reviewed including sucrose, milk and nonnutritive sucking which have been effective but thought to negatively affect breast-feeding. Full-body interventions have included tucking, swaddling, kangaroo care and massage therapy. Although these have been effective for alleviating immediate pain during invasive procedures, research is lacking on the routine use of these therapies for reducing long-term pain effects. Further, additional randomized controlled replication studies are needed.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as a significant symptom in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). While exercise is already recommended in many treatment guidelines for patients with MDD and has been shown to improve cognition in other disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia), limited research is available evaluating the effect of exercise on cognition in MDD.
   Methods: We provide a narrative review of existing literature regarding the effect(s) of exercise on cognition across several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, and particularly in MDD, with specific emphasis on study design and methodology that may impair adequate synthesis of the results. We also describe mechanisms by which exercise may improve cognition in depression and other brain disorders.
   Results: Of existing studies with MDD, data are equivocal, as some are supportive of improved cognition, whereas others demonstrate no benefit. Several limitations were noted, including insufficiently-powered designs, variability in interventions examined (e.g., aerobic, anaerobic, mind-body) or control groups, lack of attention to the status of baseline cognitive impairment, and/or heterogeneity across outcome measures and clinical characteristics.
   Conclusions: While preliminary results suggest the potential for exercise as a beneficial treatment or augmentation strategy for impaired cognition in MDD, the aforementioned limitations necessitate further investigation.

AB  - Background: Research suggests that maintaining treatment during pregnancy for women with bipolar affective disorder reduces the risk of relapse. However, one of the key questions for women and clinicians during pregnancy is whether there are implications of exposure to mood stabilizers for longer term child development. Despite these concerns, there are few recent systematic reviews comparing the impact on child developmental outcomes for individual mood-stabilizing agents to inform clinical decisions.
   Objectives: To examine the strengths and limitations of the existing data on child developmental outcomes following prenatal exposure to mood stabilizers and to explore whether there are any differences between agents for detrimental effects on child development.
   Method: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a rigorous systematic search was carried out of four electronic databases from their respective years of inception to September 2016 to identify studies which examined the effects of mood stabilizers including sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lithium and second-generation antipsychotics on child developmental outcomes.
   Results: We identified 15 studies for critical review. Of these, 10 examined antiepileptic drugs, 2 studied lithium and 3 studied second-generation antipsychotics. The most consistent finding was a dose-response relationship for valproate with higher doses associated with poorer global cognitive abilities compared to other antiepileptic drugs. The limited data available for lithium found no adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The limited second-generation antipsychotic studies included a report of a transient early neurodevelopmental delay which resolved by 12months of age.
   Conclusion: This review found higher neurodevelopmental risk with valproate. While the existing data on lithium and second-generation antipsychotics are reassuring, these data are both limited and lower quality, indicating that further research is required. The information from this review is relevant for patients and clinicians to influence choice of mood-stabilizing agent in childbearing women. This must be balanced against the known risks associated with untreated bipolar affective disorder.

AB  - Although aberrant metabolism and deposition of iron has been associated with aging and neurodegeneration, the contribution of iron to neuropathology is unclear. Well-designed model systems that are suited to studying the putative pathological effect of iron are likely to be essential if such unresolved details are to be clarified. In this review, we have evaluated the utility and effectiveness of the reductionist in vitro platform to study the molecular mechanisms putatively underlying iron perturbations of neurodegenerative disease. The expression and function of iron metabolism proteins in glia and neurons and the extent to which this iron regulatory system is replicated in in vitro models has been comprehensively described, followed by an appraisal of the inherent suitability of different in vitro and ex vivo models that have been, or might be, used for iron loading. Next, we have identified and critiqued the relevant experimental parameters that have been used in in vitro iron loading experiments, including the choice of iron reagent, relevant iron loading concentrations and supplementation with serum or ascorbate, and propose optimal iron loading conditions. Finally, we have provided a synthesis of the differential iron accumulation and toxicity in glia and neurons from reported iron loading paradigms. In summary, this review has amalgamated the findings and paradigms of the published reports modelling iron loading in monocultures, discussed the limitations and discrepancies of such work to critically propose a robust, relevant and reliable model of iron loading to be used for future investigations.

AB  - Objectives: Social isolation and loneliness have been associated with ill health and are common in the developed world. A clear understanding of their implications for morbidity and mortality is needed to gauge the extent of the associated public health challenge and the potential benefit of intervention.
   Study design: A systematic review of systematic reviews (systematic overview) was undertaken to determine the wider consequences of social isolation and loneliness, identify any differences between the two, determine differences from findings of non-systematic reviews and to clarify the direction of causality.
   Methods: Eight databases were searched from 1950 to 2016 for English language reviews covering social isolation and loneliness but not solely social support. Suitability for inclusion was determined by two or more reviewers, the methodological quality of included systematic reviews assessed using the a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (AMSTAR) checklist and the quality of evidence within these reviews using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) approach. Non-systematic reviews were sought for a comparison of findings but not included in the primary narrative synthesis.
   Results: Forty systematic reviews of mainly observational studies were identified, largely from the developed world. Meta-analyses have identified a significant association between social isolation and loneliness with increased all-cause mortality and social isolation with cardiovascular disease. Narrative systematic reviews suggest associations with poorer mental health outcomes, with less strong evidence for behavioural and other physical health outcomes. No reviews were identified for wider socio-economic or developmental outcomes.
   Conclusions: This systematic overview highlights that there is consistent evidence linking social isolation and loneliness to worse cardiovascular and mental health outcomes. The role of social isolation and loneliness in other conditions and their socio-economic consequences is less clear. More research is needed on associations with cancer, health behaviours, and the impact across the life course and wider socio-economic consequences. Policy makers and health and local government commissioners should consider social isolation and loneliness as important upstream factors impacting on morbidity and mortality due to their effects on cardiovascular and mental health. Prevention strategies should therefore be developed across the public and voluntary sectors, using an asset-based approach. (C) 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Obesity is considered one of the greatest risk to human health and is associated with several factors including genetic components, diet, and physical inactivity. Recently, the relationship between obesity and numerous progressive and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been observed. Thus, the involvement of the most abundant and heterogeneous group of glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases, the astrocytes, is caused by a combination of the failure on their normal homeostatic functions and the increase of toxic metabolites upon pathological event. Upon brain damage, molecular signals induce astrocyte activation and migration to the site of injury, entering in a highly active state, with the aim to contribute to ameliorating or worsening the pathology. In this regard, the aim of this review is to elucidate the relationship between obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and highlight the role of astrocytes in these pathologies.

AB  - Background
   Behavioural activation is an effective treatment for depression in the general adult population but it is unclear whether it is effective for older people.
   Aims
   To systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for depression in older people.
   Method
   We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and online trial registers for RCTs of behavioural activation for depression in older people.
   Results
   Eighteen trials were included in the meta-analyses. Behavioural activation reduced mean depression scores for older people living in the community as a stand-alone treatment: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.72, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.41. It was also effective as part of a multicomponent intervention (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.32).
   Conclusions
   Behavioural activation significantly reduces depressive symptoms in older people in the community; however, given that most studies are small and with significant bias results should be interpreted with caution. Further high-quality trials of behavioural activation for this age group are needed.

AB  - The evaluation and management of climate change impacts on natural and human systems required the adoption of a multi-risk perspective in which the effect of multiple stressors, processes and interconnections are simultaneously modelled. Despite Bayesian Networks (BNs) are popular integrated modelling tools to deal with uncertain and complex domains, their application in the context of climate change still represent a limited explored field. The paper, drawing on the review of existing applications in the field of environmental management, discusses the potential and limitation of applying BNs to improve current climate change risk assessment procedures. Main potentials include the advantage to consider multiple stressors and endpoints in the same framework, their flexibility in dealing and communicate with the uncertainty of climate projections and the opportunity to perform scenario analysis. Some limitations (i.e. representation of temporal and spatial dynamics, quantitative validation), however, should be overcome to boost BNs use in climate change impacts assessment and management.

AB  - Among the neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease (PD) ranks as the second most common disorder with a higher prevalence in individuals aged over 60 years old. Younger individuals may also be affected with PD which is known as early onset PD (EOPD). Despite similarities between the characteristics of EOPD and late onset PD (LODP), EOPD patients experience much longer disease manifestations and poorer quality of life. Although some individuals are more prone to have EOPD due to certain genetic alterations, the molecular mechanisms that differentiate between EOPD and LOPD remains unclear. Recent findings in PD patients revealed that there were differences in the genetic profiles of PD patients compared to healthy controls, as well as between EOPD and LOPD patients. There were variants identified that correlated with the decline of cognitive and motor symptoms as well as non-motor symptoms in PD. There were also specific microRNAs that correlated with PD progression, and since microRNAs have been shown to be involved in the maintenance of neuronal development, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, there is a strong possibility that these microRNAs can be potentially used to differentiate between subsets of PD patients. PD is mainly diagnosed at the late stage, when almost majority of the dopaminergic neurons are lost. Therefore, identification of molecular biomarkers for early detection of PD is important. Given that miRNAs are crucial in controlling the gene expression, these regulatory microRNAs and their target genes could be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD. In this article, we discussed the genes involved and their regulatory miRNAs, regarding their roles in PD progression, based on the findings of significantly altered microRNAs in EOPD studies. We also discussed the potential of these miRNAs as molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis.

AB  - Background: There is consensus that the treatment of schizophrenia should combine anti-psychotic medication and psychosocial interventions in order to address complex social, economic and health needs. It is recommended that family therapy or support; community-based rehabilitation; and/or self-help and support groups should be provided for people with schizophrenia in low and middle-income countries. The effectiveness of community-based psychosocial interventions in these settings is unclear.
   Methods: Studies evaluating community-based psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia were identified through database searching up to April 2016. Randomised controlled trials were included if they compared the intervention group with a control group receiving treatment as usual including medication. Only studies set in low and middle-income countries were included. Random effects meta-analyses were performed separately for each intervention type.
   Results: Eleven randomised controlled trials in five middle-income countries were identified, with a total of 1580 participants. The content of included interventions varied from single-faceted psychoeducational interventions, to multi-component rehabilitation-focused interventions, to case management interventions. A third of the included studies did not incorporate any community involvement in the intervention. The quality of evidence was often low. Amongst the seven studies that reported on symptom severity up to 18 months post intervention, the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) across all intervention types was 0.95 (95% CI 0.28, 1.61; P 0.005; I-2 = 95%; n = 862), representing a strong effect. A strong effect on symptom severity remained after excluding two studies with a high risk of bias (SMD 0.80; 95% CI 0.07, 1.53; P 0.03; I-2 = 94%; n = 676). Community-based psychosocial interventions may also have beneficial impacts on functioning (SMD 1.12; 95% CI 0.25, 2.00; P 0.01; I-2 = 94%; n = 511) and reducing hospital readmissions (SMD 0.68; 95% CI 0.27, 1.09; P 0.001; I-2 = 33%; n = 167).
   Conclusion: The limited evidence from low and middle-income countries supports the feasibility and effectiveness of community-based psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia, even in the absence of community mobilisation. Community-based psychosocial interventions should therefore be provided in these settings as an adjuvant service in addition to facility-based care for people with schizophrenia.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying plastic changes in the strength and connectivity of excitatory synapses have been studied extensively for the past few decades and remain the most attractive cellular models of learning and memory. One of the major mechanisms that regulate synaptic plasticity is the dynamic adjustment of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor content on the neuronal plasma membrane. The expression of surface AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is controlled by the delicate balance between the biosynthesis, dendritic transport, exocytosis, endocytosis, recycling and degradation of the receptors. These processes are dynamically regulated by AMPAR interacting proteins as well as by various post-translational modifications that occur on their cytoplasmic domains. In the last few years, protein ubiquitination has emerged as a major regulator of AMPAR intracellular trafficking. Dysregulation of AMPAR ubiquitination has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Here we review recent advances in the field and provide insights into the role of protein ubiquitination in regulating AMPAR membrane trafficking and function. We also discuss how aberrant ubiquitination of AMPARs contributes to the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, chronic stress and epilepsy.

AB  - Gradual degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta and subsequent reduction of dopamine levels in striatum are associated with motor deficits that characterize Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, half of the PD patients also exhibit frontostriatal-mediated executive dysfunction, including deficits in attention, short-term working memory, speed of mental processing, and impulsivity. The most commonly used treatments for PD are only partially or transiently effective and are available or applicable to a minority of patients. Because, these therapies neither restore the lost or degenerated dopaminergic neurons, nor prevent or delay the disease progression, the need for more effective therapeutics is critical. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the molecular signaling pathways involved in PD, particularly within the context of how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the initiation and progression of this disease. The involvement of molecular chaperones, autophagy-lysosomal pathways, and proteasome systems in PD are also highlighted. In addition, emerging therapies, including pharmacological manipulations, surgical procedures, stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, as well as complementary, supportive and rehabilitation therapies to prevent or delay the progression of this complex disease are reviewed.

AB  - Biometal dyshomeostasis and toxic metal accumulation are common features in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The neurotoxic effects of metal imbalance are generally associated with reduced enzymatic activities, elevated protein aggregation and oxidative stress in the central nervous system, in which a cascade of events lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. Although the links between biometal imbalance and neurodegenerative disorders remain elusive, a major class of endogenous proteins involved in metal transport has been receiving increasing attention over recent decades. The abnormal expression of these proteins has been linked to biometal imbalance and to the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we present a brief overview of the physiological roles of biometals including iron, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium and calcium, and provide a detailed description of their transporters and their synergistic involvement in the development of AD. In addition, we also review the published data relating to neurotoxic metals in AD, including aluminum, lead, cadmium, and mercury.

AB  - It has been shown that magnetic fields in the extremely low frequency range (ELF-MF) can act as a stressor in various in vivo or in vitro systems, at flux density levels below those inducing excitation of nerve and muscle cells, which are setting the limits used by most generally accepted exposure guidelines, such as the ones published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. In response to a variety of physiological and environmental factors, including heat, cells activate an ancient signaling pathway leading to the transient expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which exhibit sophisticated protection mechanisms. A number of studies suggest that also ELF-MF exposure can activate the cellular stress response and cause increased HSPs expression, both on the mRNA and the protein levels. In this review, we provide some of the presently available data on cellular responses, especially regarding HSP expression, due to single and combined exposure to ELF-MF and heat, with the aim to compare the induced effects and to detect possible common modes of action. Some evidence suggest that MF and heat can act as costressors inducing a kind of thermotolerance in cell cultures and in organisms. The MF exposure might produce a potentiated or synergistic biological response such as an increase in HSPs expression, in combination with a well-defined stress, and in turn exert beneficial effects during certain circumstances.

AB  - Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is one of the most widely used tools to assess economic decision-making. However, the research tradition on aging and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been mainly focused on the overall performance of older adults in relation to younger or clinical groups, remaining unclear whether older adults are capable of learning along the task. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine older adults' decision-making on the IGT, to test the effects of aging on reversal learning (45 studies) and to provide normative data on total and block net scores (55 studies). From the accumulated empirical evidence, we found an average total net score of 7.55 (+/- 25.9). We also observed a significant reversal learning effect along the blocks of the IGT, indicating that older adults inhibit the prepotent response toward immediately attractive options associated with high losses, in favor of initially less attractive options associated with long-run profit. During block 1, decisions of older adults led to a negative gambling net score, reflecting the expected initial pattern of risk-taking. However, the shift toward more safe options occurred between block 2 (small-to-medium effect size) and blocks 3, 4, 5 (medium-to-large effect size). These main findings highlight that older adults are able to move from the initial uncertainty, when the possible outcomes are unknown, to decisions based on risk, when the outcomes are learned and may be used to guide future adaptive decision-making.

AB  - Connexins (Cx) are largely represented in the central nervous system (CNS) with 11 Cx isoforms forming intercellular channels. Moreover, in the CNS, Cx43 can form hemichannels (HCs) at non-junctional membrane as does the related channel-forming Pannexin1 (Panx1) and Panx2. Opening of Panx1 channels and Cx43 HCs appears to be involved in inflammation and has been documented in various CNS pathologies. Over recent years, evidence has accumulated supporting a link between inflammation and cerebral neuropathies (migraine, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Involvement of Panx1 channels and Cx43 HCs has been also proposed in pathophysiology of neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Other studies showed that following inflammatory injury of the CNS, Panx1 activators are released and prolonged opening of Panx1 channels triggers neuronal death. In neuropsychiatric diseases, comorbidities are frequently present and can aggravate the symptoms and make therapeutic management more complex. The high comorbidity between some neuropathies can be partially understood by the fact that these diseases share a common etiology involving inflammatory pathways and Panx1 channels or Cx43 HCs. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy opens perspectives of targets for new treatments and could have real potential in controlling a cerebral neuropathy and some of its comorbidities. The purpose of this mini review is to provide information of our knowledge on the link between Cx43- and Panx-based channels, inflammation and cerebral neuropathies.

In addition, I outline future directions in this emergent field and highlight how the study of emotional acculturation may inform emotion psychology as it calls for a truly sociodynamic perspective on what emotions are and how they can/should be studied.

AB  - Forgiveness is frequently investigated, and many methods of assessment have been used. However, discerning which methods of assessment to use for which purposes has generally not been based on systematic analysis. We searched four databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycINFO. Forgiveness measures were grouped into Forgiveness Scales (i.e., Dispositional Forgiveness, Episodic Forgiveness, and Dyadic Forgiveness) and Other Measures of Forgiveness (i.e., implicit, behavioral, and biological measures). We reviewed original articles that describe the development of 45 measures and compiled psychometric information (including instrument language and availability, original samples, instrument composition, estimated reliabilities of scores, evidence of construct validity, and an evaluation of each measure). Also, our review suggests a nomological network of associations regarding the construct validity of interpreting scores as forgiveness. Those associations inform the concept of forgiveness, describing which and how variables are associated with this construct. We evaluate the level of sophistication of research in forgiveness assessment and offer suggestions to consider when choosing specific instruments to assess dispositional and episodic forgiveness.

   Depression in schizophrenia predicts poor outcomes, including suicide, yet the effectiveness of antidepressants for its treatment remains uncertain.
   Aims
   To synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in schizophrenia.
   Method
   Multiple databases were searched and inclusion criteria included participants aged over 18 years with schizophrenia or related psychosis with a depressive episode. Papers were quality assessed used the Cochrane risk bias tool. Meta analyses were performed for risk difference and standardised mean difference of all antidepressants, antidepressant class and individual antidepressant where sufficient studies allowed.
   Results
   A total of 26 moderate-to low-quality trials met inclusion criteria. In meta-analysis a significant risk difference was found in favour of antidepressant treatment, with a number needed to treat of 5 (95% Cl 4-9). Studies using tools specifically designed to assess depression in schizophrenia showed a larger effect size. However, after sensitivity analysis standardised mean difference of all antidepressants did not show a statistically significant improvement in depression score at end-point, neither did any individual antidepressant class.
   Conclusions
   Antidepressants may be effective for the treatment of depression in schizophrenia, however, the evidence is mixed and conclusions must be qualified by the small number of low-or moderate-quality studies. Further sufficiently powered, high-quality studies are needed.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by information processing biases, however, their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The goal of this review was to give a comprehensive overview of the most frequently studied EEG spectral and event-related potential (ERP) measures in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery. A Web of Science search yielded 35 studies reporting on electrocortical measures in individuals with social anxiety or related constructs. Social anxiety was related to increased delta-beta cross-frequency correlation during anticipation and recovery, and information processing biases during early processing of faces (P1) and errors (error-related negativity). These electrocortical measures are discussed in relation to the persistent cycle of information processing biases maintaining SAD. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms of this persistent cycle and study the utility of electrocortical measures in early detection, prevention, treatment and endophenotype research.

KW  - WORLD
AB  - Social neuroscience has documented cultural differences in emotional brain functioning. Most recently, these differences have been extended to include cultural effects on the real-time neural correlates of social-emotional feelings. Here we review these findings and use them to illustrate a biopsychosocial framework for studying acculturated social-affective functioning and development. We argue that understanding cultural differences in emotion neurobiology requires probing their social origins and connection with individuals' subjective, lived experiences. We suggest that an interdisciplinary, developmental perspective would advance scientific understanding by enabling the invention of protocols aligning neurobiological measures with techniques for documenting cultural contexts, social relationships and subjective experiences. Such work would also facilitate insights in applied fields struggling to accommodate cultural variation, such as psychiatry and education.

AB  - Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of parkinsonism, and it may serve as a prodromal marker of neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism underlying RBD is unclear. Several prospective studies have reported that specific non-motor symptoms predict a conversion risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease, including olfactory dysfunction, abnormal color vision, autonomic dysfunction, excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, and cognitive impairment. Parkinson's disease (PD) with RBD exhibits clinical heterogeneity with respect to motor and non-motor symptoms compared with PD without RBD. In this review, we describe the main clinical and pathogenic features of RBD, focusing on its association with other non-motor symptoms of parkinsonism.

This review integrates existing studies on web search data that have explored topics including sexual behavior, suicidal behavior, mental health, social prejudice, social inequality, public responses to policies, and other psychosocial issues. These studies are categorized as descriptive, correlational, inferential, predictive, and policy evaluation research. The integration of theory-based hypothesis testing in future web search research will result in even stronger contributions to social psychology.

AB  - Objective: Bipolar disorder in pregnancy may be difficult to treat. The dilemma is whether the women should continue medication throughout pregnancy, and maybe accept a minor risk to harm their unborn child, or discontinue medication and increase the risk of recurrence, which can lead to maternal morbidity, thereby endangering themselves and their foetus.
   Design and methods: In September 2016, three electronic search databases; PubMed, Scopus and PsycInfo, were used searching for clinical trials concerning this question. Eight clinical trials concerning risk of recurrence after discontinuation of medication in pregnancy were included.
   Results: There is no consensus concerning the risk of discontinuation of medication during pregnancy among bipolar women. The evidence from the trials included underscore that there seem to be a group of pregnant women who are stable despite they are not receiving mood stabilisers during pregnancy. Besides, there is a group of more severe and more unstable bipolar disorders that seem to benefit of a more close monitoring, support and prophylactic medication during pregnancy and postpartum period to prevent recurrence.
   Conclusion: For the more stable bipolar women we recommend a well planned and more slowly discontinuation of medication before pregnancy. For the unplanned pregnancies it is important to consider the possibility of a more slowly discontinuation. For the more severe conditions of bipolar disorder, it is important to secure a close monitoring of medication. As the risk of postpartum relapse is high, medication may be started soon after delivery.

AB  - Objective: Antipsychotic drug efficacy may have decreased over recent decades. The authors present a meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, and they investigate which trial characteristics have changed over the years and which are moderators of drug-placebo efficacy differences.
   Method: The search included multiple electronic databases. The outcomes were overall efficacy (primary outcome); responder and dropout rates; positive, negative, and depressive symptoms; quality of life; functioning; and major side effects. Potential moderators of efficacy were analyzed by meta-regression.
   Results: The analysis included 167 double-blind randomized controlled trials with 28,102 mainly chronic participants. The standardized mean difference (SMD) for overall efficacy was 0.47 (95% credible interval 0.42, 0.51), but accounting for small-trial effects and publication bias reduced the SMD to 0.38. At least a "minimal" response occurred in 51% of the antipsychotic group versus 30% in the placebo group, and 23% versus 14% had a "good" response. Positive symptoms (SMD 0.45) improved more than negative symptoms (SMD 0.35) and depression (SMD 0.27). Quality of life (SMD 0.35) and functioning (SMD 0.34) improved even in the short term. Antipsychotics differed substantially in side effects. Of the response predictors analyzed, 16 trial characteristics changed over the decades. However, in a multivariable meta-regression, only industry sponsorship and increasing placebo response were significant moderators of effect sizes. Drug response remained stable over time.
   Conclusions: Approximately twice as many patients improved with antipsychotics as with placebo, but only a minority experienced a good response. Effect sizes were reduced by industry sponsorship and increasing placebo response, not decreasing drug response. Drug development may benefit from smaller samples but better-selected patients.

AB  - As a multi-factorial degenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to tremor, gait rigidity, and hypokinesia, thus hampering normal living. As this disease is usually detected in the later stages when neurons have degenerated completely, cure is on hold, ultimately leading to death due to the lack of early diagnostic techniques. Thus, biomarkers are required to detect the disease in the early stages when prevention is possible. Various biomarkers providing early diagnosis of the disease include those of imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, oxidative stress, neuroprotection, and inflammation. Also, biomarkers, alone or in combination, are used in the diagnosis and evolution of PD. This review encompasses various biomarkers available for PD and discusses recent advances in their development.

AB  - Introduction: Three recent systematic reviews suggested a relationship between noise exposure and adverse birth outcomes. The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence for the World Health Organization (WHO) noise guidelines and conduct an updated systematic review of environmental noise, specifically aircraft and road traffic noise and birth outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, being small for gestational age and congenital malformations. Materials and methods: We reviewed again all the papers on environmental noise and birth outcomes included in the previous three systematic reviews and conducted a systematic search on noise and birth outcomes to update previous reviews. Web of Science, PubMed and Embase electronic databases were searched for papers published between June 2014 (end date of previous systematic review) and December 2016 using a list of specific search terms. Studies were also screened in the reference list of relevant reviews/articles. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies provided by the WHO expert group were applied. Risk of bias was assessed according to criteria from the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for case-control and cohort studies. Finally, we applied the GRADE principles to our systematic review in a reproducible and appropriate way for judgment about quality of evidence. Results: In total, 14 studies are included in this review, six studies on aircraft noise and birth outcomes, five studies (two with more or less the same population) on road traffic noise and birth outcomes and three related studies on total ambient noise that is likely to be mostly traffic noise that met the criteria. The number of studies on environmental noise and birth outcomes is small and the quality of evidence generally ranges from very low to low, particularly in case of the older studies. The quality is better for the more recent traffic noise and birth outcomes studies. As there were too few studies, we did not conduct meta-analyses. Discussion: This systematic review is supported by previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses that suggested that there may be some suggestive evidence for an association between environmental noise exposure and birth outcomes, although they pointed more generally to a stronger role of occupational noise exposure, which tends to be higher and last longer. Very strict criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies, performance of quality assessment for risk of bias, and finally applying GRADE principles for judgment of quality of evidence are the strengths of this review. Conclusions: We found evidence of very low quality for associations between aircraft noise and preterm birth, low birth weight and congenital anomalies, and low quality evidence for an association between road traffic noise and low birth weight, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Further high quality studies are required to establish such associations. Future studies are recommended to apply robust exposure assessment methods (e.g., modeled or measured noise levels at bedroom facade), disentangle associations for different sources of noise as well as daytime and nighttime noise, evaluate the impacts of noise evens that stand out of the noise background), and control the analyses for confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors and other environmental factors, especially air pollution.

AB  - Objective: To examine the cognitive profile of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) on the basis of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.
   Methods: Embase, Medline and Psyclnfo were searched for studies reporting >1 neuropsychological test in both DM1 patients and healthy controls. Search, data extraction and risk of bias analysis were independently performed by two authors to minimize error. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into 12 cognitive domains and effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated for each domain and for tests administered in >5 studies.
   Results: DM1 participants demonstrated a significantly worse performance compared to controls in all cognitive domains. Effect sizes ranged from.33 (small) for verbal memory to 1.01 (large) for visuospatial perception. Except for the domains global cognition, intelligence and social cognition, wide confidence intervals (CIs) were associated with moderate to marked statistical heterogeneity that necessitates careful interpretation of results. Out of the individual tests, the Rey Osterrieth complex figure-copy (both nonverbal memory and visuoconstruction) showed consistent impairment with acceptable heterogeneity.
   Conclusion: In DM1 patients, cognitive deficits may include a variable combination of global cognitive impairment with involvement across different domains, including social cognition, memory and visuospatial functioning. Although DM1 is a heterogeneous disorder, our study shows that meta-analysis is feasible, contributes to the understanding of brain involvement and may direct bedside testing.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to elucidate whether schizophrenia and type II diabetes mellitus may present with associated illness severity, in light of accumulating evidence to suggest both conditions have important shared inflammatory components with many shared inflammatory genetic factors.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review employing PRISMA criteria, searching EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Psychlnfo, Web of Science and Google Scholar to February 1st, 2017, for clinical studies assessing schizophrenia severity alongside dysglycaemia. A narrative synthesis was employed to discuss and compare findings between studies.
   Results: Eleven observational studies were included in the analysis. Ten presented evidence in support of an association between schizophrenia severity and dysglycaemia. This association appeared particularly strong regarding negative symptomatology and impaired cognitive function, between which there may be some overlap. Studies examining positive symptomatology returned mixed results.
   Conclusion: Whilst study design varied amongst the included studies, the results suggest that further work examining the effect of hyperglycaemia on schizophrenia severity may be relevant, particularly longitudinal studies assessing negative symptomatology and cognitive function. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review conducted to address this question.

AB  - Typical Parkinsonian symptoms consist of bradykinesia plus rigidity and/or resting tremor. Some time later postural instability occurs. Pre-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder and depression may antecede these motor symptoms for years. It would be ideal, if we had a biomarker which would allow to predict who with one or two of these pre-motor symptoms will develop the movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is interesting to learn that biopsies of the submandibular gland or colon biopsies may be a means to predict PD, if there is a high amout of abnormally folded alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. This would be of relevance if we would have available means to stop the propagation of abnormal alpha-synuclein which is otherwise one of the reasons of this spreading disease PD.

AB  - Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) are structures that regulate physiological functions between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in order to maintain calcium signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis. Several proteins located in MAMs, including those encoded by PARK genes and some of neurodegeneration-related proteins (huntingtin, presenilin, etc.), ensure this regulation. In this regard, MAM alteration is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD), and Huntington's diseases (HD) and contributes to the appearance of the pathogenesis features, i.e., autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lately, neuronal death. Moreover,, ER stress and/or damaged mitochondria can be the cause of these disruptions. Therefore, ER-mitochondria contact structure and function are crucial to multiple cellular processes. This review is focused on the molecular interaction between ER and mitochondria indispensable to MAM formation and on MAM alteration-induced etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Despite exercise or physical activity (PA) being effective on depression and weight management generally, its effectiveness remains uncertain during postpartum. This systematic review aimed to determine the efficacy of exercise or PA interventions on postnatal depression (PND) and weight loss, with a subsequent aim to identify more effective intervention approaches. Using PRISMA guidelines, data searches conducted across six databases. Nine studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Based on identified studies (some with high-quality RCT designs), there was inconsistency as to whether exercise or PA simultaneously reduced PND symptoms and assisted weight loss (or related body composition indices). Two (22.2%) identified changes in both outcomes with small effect sizes. Four studies (44.4%) reported changes in one outcome, typically PND with variable effect sizes, while three studies (33.3%) reported no effect. Studies implemented different exercise/PA modalities (commonly walking) and incorporated various support strategies to assist intervention participation and adherence. Studies identified as most likely to associate with PND and/or weight loss changes were those with supervision (1-1, group), structure (weekly frequency, scheduled durations and moderate intensity), which adhered to specific exercise/PA guidelines over an extended postpartum period (e.g. 12 weeks +) and were supplemented by several psycho-social support strategies (e.g. educational information, exercise/PA advice, and counselling). Future studies need to carefully address prior study methodological weaknesses (e.g. study design, inclusion criteria, measurement, reporting, assessing confounding factors), further examine proposed more beneficial exercise/PA intervention approaches, and consider how exercise/PA could be best delivered in practice to benefit women's postpartum health.

AB  - The application of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) is a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Many NTFs have been reported to enhance the survival, regeneration, and differentiation of neurons and to induce synaptic plasticity. However, because of their potential side-effects and low efficacy after clinical administration, more potent treatments for neurodegenerative disorders are being sought. Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), a newly-identified NTF homologous to mesencephalic astrocyte-derived NTF, is structurally and functionally different from other NTFs, providing new hope especially for PD patients. In various animal models of PD, CDNF is efficient in protecting and repairing dopaminergic neurons, and it inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. Recent progress in all facets of CDNF research has enabled researchers to better understand its beneficial effects in the treatment of PD.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a long preclinical phase. The continuous loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons is one of the pathogenic hallmarks of PD. Diagnosis largely depends on clinical observation, but motor dysfunctions do not emerge until 70%-80% of the nigrostriatal nerve terminals have been destroyed. Therefore, a biomarker that indicates the degeneration of DA neurons is urgently needed. Transcription factors are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate RNA synthesis from a DNA template. The precise control of gene expression plays a critical role in the development, maintenance, and survival of cells, including DA neurons. Deficiency of certain transcription factors has been associated with DA neuron loss and PD. In this review, we focus on some transcription factors and discuss their structure, function, mechanisms of neuroprotection, and their potential for use as biomarkers indicating the degeneration of DA neurons.

AB  - Childhood trauma (CT) is a modifiable risk factor for lifetime suicide attempts (SA). However, the extent to which each type of CT increases SA risk is unclear. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies published in the last 10 years about the relationship between CT and lifetime SA risk. The PUBMED, PsycINFO, ISI, and EMBASE databases were searched for cohort studies that reported AS during follow-up and included an assessment of CT. A meta-analysis was conducted to identify potential effects of each type of CT on SA. Seven unique studies were included for review. Sexual (n=6, OR=3.73, 95%CI 2.94-4.75, p < 0.001), physical (n=6, OR=4.11, 95%CI 2.30-7.33, p < 0.001), and emotional abuse (n=3, OR=3.98, 95%CI 2.89-5.64, p < 0.001), as well as physical neglect (n=2, OR=3.42, 95%CI 2.09-5.59, p < 0.001), were associated with SA. Emotional neglect and a broken home were not significantly associated with further SA. The modes of CT that most contribute to SA in later life are physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and physical neglect, in descending order.

   To identify factors that promote a positive start to school for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   METHODS
   Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsychINFO searches were conducted to identify literature published after 1991 and relevant to school transition processes in children with ASD. Twenty studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. These studies evaluated a range of factors including school readiness, parent and teacher perspectives on transition practices, characteristics of children with ASD that are associated with successful transition to school and the impact of school based intervention programs.
   RESULTS
   A review of these studies showed that children with ASD are less school ready emotionally than their peers and those children with ASD appear to have more externalising behaviours and self-regulation difficulties that affect their school engagement and their relationships with their teachers. There was a paucity of research looking at interventions targeting school readiness. However, school-based behavioural interventions appear to improve cognitive, language and daily living skills, but have less impact on socialisation and peer inclusion.
   CONCLUSION
   Children with ASD face more challenges transitioning to school, particularly with social interaction. Further development and implementation of specific schoolbased interventions is needed in order to assist children with autism to maximise their success in starting school.

AB  - Fairness-related decision making is an important issue in the field of decision making. Traditional theories emphasize the roles of inequity aversion and reciprocity, whereas recent research increasingly shows that emotion plays a critical role in this type of decision making. In this review, we summarize the influences of three types of emotions (i.e., the integral emotion experienced at the time of decision making, the incidental emotion aroused by a task-unrelated dispositional or situational source, and the interaction of emotion and cognition) on fairness-related decision making. Specifically, we first introduce three dominant theories that describe how emotion may influence fairness-related decision making (i.e., the wounded pride/spite model, affect infusion model, and dual-process model). Next, we collect behavioral and neural evidence for and against these theories. Finally, we propose that future research on fairness-related decision making should focus on inducing incidental social emotion, avoiding irrelevant emotion when regulating, exploring the individual differences in emotional dispositions, and strengthening the ecological validity of the paradigm.

AB  - The production of melanin is a complex process involving biochemical cascades, such as the pro-phenoloxidase (proPO) system, and enzymes, such as phenoloxidases (POs). Different studies have shown a strong correlation between the decrease in PO activities and the occurrence of diseases in bivalve invertebrates, leading to mortalities in the host. Results of these studies suggest that POs could play a fundamental role in defense mechanisms in bivalves. This article reviews the fundamental knowledge on the proPO system in bivalves and the methods used to assess PO activities. Finally, this is the first report on the major findings of laboratory and field studies that indicate that a type of PO in bivalves, the laccase enzyme, is inducible and involved in the 1) immune 2) antioxidant and 3) detoxification roles in bivalves, and might be an ecological potential biomarker of environmental stress.

AB  - Statistical analysis is crucial for research and the choice of analytical technique should take into account the specific distribution of data. Although the data obtained from health, educational, and social sciences research are often not normally distributed, there are very few studies detailing which distributions are most likely to represent data in these disciplines. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the frequency of appearance of the most common non-normal distributions in the health, educational, and social sciences. The search was carried out in the Web of Science database, from which we retrieved the abstracts of papers published between 2010 and 2015. The selection was made on the basis of the title and the abstract, and was performed independently by two reviewers. The inter-rater reliability for article selection was high (Cohen's kappa = 0.84), and agreement regarding the type of distribution reached 96.5%. A total of 262 abstracts were included in the final review. The distribution of the response variable was reported in 231 of these abstracts, while in the remaining 31 it was merely stated that the distribution was non-normal. In terms of their frequency of appearance, the most-common non-normal distributions can be ranked in descending order as follows: gamma, negative binomial, multinomial, binomial, lognormal, and exponential. In addition to identifying the distributions most commonly used in empirical studies these results will help researchers to decide which distributions should be included in simulation studies examining statistical procedures.

AB  - Expressed emotion (EE) refers to the criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement family members may display toward an individual diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Recent research has explored EE in relation to suicide risk, yet the association between EE and recurrence of suicidal behaviors remains understudied. The present paper provides an illustrative review of the links between EE, psychiatric symptom recurrence, and suicide risk, proposes a new conceptual framework - the Expressed Emotion-Suicidal Behavior Recurrence model (EE-SBR), and provides recommendations for future research and clinical practice within the fields of suicidology and family psychology. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to consider the role of the family and EE as they relate to relapse prevention efforts.

AB  - Aging constitutes the main risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. This represents a major health issue worldwide that is only expected to escalate due to the ever-increasing life expectancy of the population. Interestingly, axonal degeneration, which occurs at early stages of neurodegenerative disorders (ND) such as Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, also takes place as a consequence of normal aging. Moreover, the alteration of several cellular processes such as proteostasis, response to cellular stress and mitochondrial homeostasis, which have been described to occur in the aging brain, can also contribute to axonal pathology. Compelling evidence indicate that the degeneration of axons precedes clinical symptoms in NDs and occurs before cell body loss, constituting an early event in the pathological process and providing a potential therapeutic target to treat neurodegeneration before neuronal cell death. Although, normal aging and the development of neurodegeneration are two processes that are closely linked, the molecular basis of the switch that triggers the transition from healthy aging to neurodegeneration remains unrevealed. In this review we discuss the potential role of axonal degeneration in this transition and provide a detailed overview of the literature and current advances in the molecular understanding of the cellular changes that occur during aging that promote axonal degeneration and then discuss this in the context of ND.

AB  - Background: Catatonia is a commonly encountered syndrome, affecting 10-20% of various psychiatric populations and carrying significant medical co-morbidities. However, there are few established alternative treatment strategies when benzodiazepines are ineffective and electroconvulsive therapy is unavailable.
   Objective: The authors systematically review evidence for alternative treatment strategies for catatonia using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Method: The authors conducted a search of PubMed database from 1983 to August 2016 to identify articles. Eligible reports presented cases involving treatment of catatonia using modalities other than benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy.
   Results: The authors identified 72 articles, comprising 98 individual cases. N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonists, anti-epileptic drugs, and atypical antipsychotic agents appeared to have the largest number of reports supporting their effectiveness and safety in treating catatonia patients.
   Conclusions: Based on the case report literature, the authors propose an updated algorithm for catatonia treatment in cases where benzodiazepines fail and electroconvulsive therapy is not available.

AB  - Within the language domain, movement disorders triggered by frontostriatal damage are characterized by deficits in action verbs, motor-language coupling, and syntax. However, these impairments have not been jointly interpreted under a unifying rationale or integratively assessed in terms of possible clinical implications. To bridge these gaps, here we introduce the "disrupted motor grounding hypothesis", a new framework to conceive such impairments as disturbances of embodied mechanisms (high-order domains based on the recycling of functionally germane sensorimotor circuits). We focus on two relevant lesion models: Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. First, we describe the physiopathology of both conditions as models of progressive frontostriatal impairment. Then, we summarize works assessing action language, motor-language coupling, and syntax in samples at early and preclinical disease stages. To conclude, we discuss the implications of the evidence for neurolinguistic modeling, identify key issues to be addressed in future research, and discuss potential clinical implications. In brief, our work seeks to open new theoretical and translational avenues for embodied cognition research.

   Study selection: Randomised controlled trials, comparing any treatment arm with a control group, for participants meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or equivalent criteria for both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and stimulant use disorder.
   Results: Eight trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Four of eight studies showed improvement in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder outcome measures compared with placebo. Two of six studies that reported substance use outcomes showed improvement in treatment arms compared with placebo. Studies to show effect tended to be those with the highest treatment dosage.
   Conclusion: Evidence for the efficacy of treatment of patients with comorbid stimulant use disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is limited. Promising outcomes need replication in further studies utilising higher treatment dosage.

KW  - Wilson disease
AB  - Wilson's disease (WD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to copper metabolism. Schizophrenia-like psychosis and delusional disorder are rare forms of psychiatric manifestations of WD. The lack of recognition of these signs and symptoms as being attributable to WD often leads to delays in diagnosis and management. Knowledge about relationship of the psychiatric manifestations to WD can help with the administration of adequate management aimed at both the psychiatric issues and underlying WD. The objectives of this article are to review case reports whose subject is the incorrect diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like syndrome in patients with WD and to detail one case of this mismanagement of the disease. A 35-year-old unmarried Iranian woman presented to the consulting psychiatrist in the emergency room after a suicide attempt due to commanding auditory hallucination. She had previous eleven admissions in psychiatric hospital with major depressive episode with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorders, and then schizophrenia diagnosis. Nineteen years after her first symptoms, it was discovered that the patient was suffering from WD. We searched Google Scholar, Ovid, PsycINFO, CINHAL, and PubMed databases from 1985 to 2015. Finally, 14 researches were entered into the study. Psychiatric manifestations may precede the diagnosis of WD and other symptoms related to neurological or hepatic impairment. Early detection of WD is important to prevent catastrophic outcome. Young patients presenting with psychiatric presentations along with abnormal movement disorder, seizure, or conversion-like symptoms should be evaluate for WD even if signs and symptoms are typically suggestive of schizophrenia or manic episode. An interdisciplinary approach with good collaboration of psychiatrists and neurologists is crucial for WD because early diagnosis and management without delay is an important for good prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the association of late-life depression (LLD) with hippocampal volume (HCV) and total brain volume (TBV), and of cortisol levels with HCV, including subgroup analyses of depression characteristics and methodological aspects.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for original studies that examined the cross-sectional relationship between LLD and HCV or TBV, and 46 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) between LLD and control subjects were calculated from crude or adjusted brain volumes using random effects. Standardized Fisher transformations of the correlations between cortisol levels and HCVs were calculated using random effects.
   RESULTS: We included 2702 LLD patients and 11,165 control subjects from 35 studies examining HCV. Relative to control subjects, patients had significantly smaller HCVs (standardized mean difference = -0.32 [95% confidence interval, -0.44 to -0.19]). Subgroup analyses showed that late-onset depression was more strongly associated with HCV than early-onset depression. In addition, effect sizes were larger for case-control studies, studies with lower quality, and studies with small sample size, and were almost absent in cohort studies and studies with larger sample sizes. For TBV, 2523 patients and 7880 control subjects from 31 studies were included. The standardized mean difference in TBV between LLD and control subjects was -0.10 (95% confidence interval, -0.16 to -0.04). Of the 12 studies included, higher levels of cortisol were associated with smaller HCV (correlation = -0.11 [95% confidence interval, -0.18 to -0.04]).
   CONCLUSIONS: While an overall measure of LLD may be associated with smaller HCVs, differentiating clinical aspects of LLD and examining methodological issues show that this relationship is not straightforward.

AB  - Psychiatric research has increased remarkably over recent decades to help in understanding the current trends and better therapeutic options for illness. On the other hand, there is also a trend toward higher rates of retraction of published papers in the recent years. Ethics is required to maintain and increase the overall quality and morality of research. Psychiatric research faces several unique ethical challenges. Ethical guidelines are very important tool of research which safeguards participants; however, there is a dearth of such guidelines in India. The present paper aims to review available ethical issues and guidelines pertaining to psychiatric research. A search was conducted on Pubmed using search terms (e.g., "ethics," "psychiatry," "research"). Relevant studies were selected for the review after manual screening of title/abstract. Additional sources were referred to using cross references and Google Scholar. Psychiatric research has several important ethical issues which are different from other medical disciplines. These issues are related to informed consent, confidentiality, conflict of interest, therapeutic misconception, placebo related, vulnerability, exploitation, operational challenges, among others. The current paper has made several recommendations to deal with ethical challenges commonly faced in psychiatric research. The ethical guidelines are utmost needed for Indian psychiatric research. Specific guidelines are lacking pertaining to psychiatric research. The issues and recommendations merit a further discussion and consideration.

AB  - Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions have been described in different psychiatric disorders. Several studies have found gustatory and olfactory function change in bipolar disorders with various results. The aim of this study is to have a systematic review of studies evaluating gustatory and olfactory function in bipolar disorders. After a systematic search, 15 studies on olfaction and 5 studies on taste were included in this review. The UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and Sniffin' Sticks were the most widely used tests to evaluate smell. Some studies on olfaction described dysfunctions in smell identification as potential markers for bipolar disorders. Moreover, olfactory acuity was associated with psychosocial and cognitive performances. For taste, only few studies used standardized tests to evaluate gustation. These studies showed that patients with Bipolar disorders had more gustatory dysfunction compared to controls, and to non-bipolar depressed patients.

AB  - Objective: We reviewed studies on pulmonary, reproductive, and developmental toxicity caused by carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In paricular, we analyzed how CNT exposure affects the several processes of pulmonary toxicity, including inflammation, injury, fibrosis, and pulmonary tumors. Methods: In pulmonary toxicity, there are various processes, including inflammation, injury, fibrosis, respiratory tumor in the lungs, and biopersistence of CNTs and genotoxicity as tumor-related factors, to develop the respiratory tumor. We evaluated the evidence for the carcinogenicity of CNTs in each process. In the fields of reproductive and developmental toxicity, studies of CNTs have been conducted mainly with mice. We summarized the findings of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies of CNTs. Results: In animal studies, exposure to CNTs induced sustained inflammation, fibrosis, lung cancer following long-term inhalation, and gene damage in the lung. CNTs also showed high biopersistence in animal studies. Fetal malformations after intravenous and intraperitoneal injections and intratracheal instillation, fetal loss after intravenous injection, behavioral changes in offsprings after intraperitoneal injection, and a delay in the delivery of the first litter after intratracheal instillation were reported in mice-administered multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) appeared to be embryolethal and teratogenic in mice when given by intravenous injection; moreover, the tubes induced death and growth retardation in chicken embryos. Conclusion: CNTs are considered to have carcinogenicity and can cause lung tumors. However, the carcinogenicity of CNTs may attenuate if the fiber length is shorter. The available data provide initial information on the potential reproductive and developmental toxicity of CNTs.

AB  - A major challenge in Parkinson disease (PD) will be to turn an emerging and expanding pipeline of novel disease-modifying candidate compounds into therapeutics. Novel targets need in vivo validation, and candidate therapeutics require appropriate preclinical platforms on which to define potential efficacy and target engagement before advancement to clinical development. We propose that alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-based mammalian models will be crucial for this process. Here, we review alpha-syn transgenic mouse models, viral vector models of alpha-syn overexpression and models of 'prion-like' spread of alpha-syn, and describe how each of these model types may contribute to PD drug discovery. We conclude by presenting our opinion on how to use a combination of these models through the late-stage preclinical, proof-of-principle investigation of novel therapeutics.

AB  - Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential nutrient and indispensable for normal growth and development of the organism due to its multilateral participation in key biochemical and physiological processes. Humans must obtain thiamine from their diet since it is synthesized only in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Thiamine deficiency (TD) can result from inadequate intake, increased requirement, excessive deletion, and chronic alcohol consumption. TD affects multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, muscular, gastrointestinal, and central and peripheral nervous systems. In the brain, TD causes a cascade of events including mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, which are commonly observed in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Thiamine metabolites may serve as promising biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, and thiamine supplementations exhibit therapeutic potential for patients of some neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental TD has been used to model aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, to date, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TD-induced neurodegeneration are not clear. Recent research evidence indicates that TD causes oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy in the brain, which are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the role of oxidative stress, ER stress, and autophagy in TD-mediated neurodegeneration. We propose that it is the interplay of oxidative stress, ER stress, and autophagy that contributes to TD-mediated neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Perceived fatigue (i.e., subjective perception of reduced capacity) is one of the most common and disabling symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Perceived fatigue may also be related to performance fatigability (i.e., decline in physical performance over time), although study findings have been inconsistent.
   Objective: To locate all studies reporting the relationship between perceived fatigue and fatigability in people with MS, determine the population correlation, and examine moderating variables of the correlation size.
   Methods: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches were completed in Medline, Psychlnfo, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library for peer -reviewed articles published between March 1983 and August 2016. Included articles measured perceived fatigue and performance fatigability in people with MS and provided a correlation between measures. Moderator variables expected to influence the relationship were also coded. Searches located 19 studies of 848 people with MS and a random-effects model was used to pool correlations.
   Results: The mean correlation between fatigue and fatigability was positive, "medium" in magnitude, and statistically significant, r = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.21, 0.42), p < 0.001. Despite moderate between-study heterogeneity (I-2 = 46%) no statistically significant moderators were found, perhaps due to the small number of studies per moderator category.
   Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between perceived fatigue and fatigability in MS, such that people reporting elevated fatigue also are highly fatigable. The size of the relationship is not large enough to suggest fatigue and fatigability are the same construct, and both should continue to be assessed independently.

Here we provide the first comprehensive review of what is known about alterations in this form of non-associative learning in each disorder. Across several disorders, abnormal habituation is predictive of symptom severity, highlighting the clinical significance of habituation and its importance to normal cognitive function. Abnormal habituation is discussed within the greater framework of learning theory and how it may relate to disease phenotype either as a cause, symptom, or therapy. Important considerations for the design and interpretation of habituation experiments are outlined with the hope that these will aid both clinicians and basic researchers investigating how this simple form of learning is altered in disease.

AB  - Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose of Review We review recent advances in psychotherapies for depressed older adults, in particular those developed for special populations characterized by chronic medical illness, acute medical illness, cognitive impairment, and suicide risk factors. We review adaptations for psychotherapy to overcome barriers to its accessibility in non-specialty settings such as primary care, homebound or hard-to-reach older adults, and social service settings.
   Recent Findings Recent evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapies that target late-life depression in the context of specific comorbid conditions including COPD, heart failure, Parkinson's disease, stroke and other acute conditions, cognitive impairment, and suicide risk. Growing evidence supports the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of psychotherapy modified for a variety of health care and social service settings.
   Summary Research supports the benefits of selecting the type of psychotherapy based on a comprehensive assessment of the older adult's psychiatric, medical, functional, and cognitive status, and tailoring psychotherapy to the settings in which older depressed adults are most likely to present.

AB  - Negative life events can exacerbate symptoms in schizophrenia, but there is no literature on the effect on psychotic symptoms of positive life events. The purpose of this review was to scan the literature that studies how the joy that accompanies positive life events can be dampened and dismissed or, alternatively, savored and maintained, and how this contrast applies to schizophrenia. A literature search elicited 53 articles relevant to schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was found to be linked with difficulties in the processing of reward, in feeling that one was deserving of a reward, in sharing news of positive events, in knowing with whom to share, in knowing how to elicit a positive response from listeners when communicating good news, and in ensuring that positive feelings endure. There was no evidence that positive life events reduce psychosis symptoms but teaching the various skills of how to capitalize on good fortune can nevertheless improve the quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia.

Innovative approaches involving online delivery platforms, sports and exercise, positive psychology and lifestyle interventions, mobilizing community networks, and mental health first aid, are some exciting and upcoming areas for future research.SummaryMental health promotion interventions are applicable to individuals, groups, and whole populations and can be delivered in many ways, including media and communication technology. They can be applied in low-resource settings by mobilizing existing community resources like opinion leaders, health workers, and peer educators, thereby increasing cost-efficiency, cultural acceptability, and local capacity. There needs to be a greater focus on study designs and variable measures that examine process-factors affecting well being outcomes. Early interventions through intersectorial collaborations may result in improved long-term positive mental health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.

AB  - Disgust is a multifaceted experience that might affect several aspects of life. Here, we reviewed research on neurological and psychiatric disorders that are characterized by abnormal disgust processing to test the hypothesis of a shared neurocognitive architecture in the representation of three disgust domains: i) personal experience of 'core disgust'; ii) social disgust, i.e., sensitivity to others' expressions of disgust; iii) moral disgust, i.e., sensitivity to ethical violations. Our review provides some support to the shared neurocognitive hypothesis and suggests that the insula might be the "hub" structure linking the three domains of disgust sensitivity, while other brain regions may subserve specific facets of the multidimensional experience. Our review also suggests a role of serotonin core and moral disgust, supporting "neo-sentimentalist" theories of morality, which posit a causal role of affect in moral judgment.

AB  - Objectives: The Cyberball paradigm is often used to study social stress by exclusion/rejection. We aimed to review the existing neuroimaging literatures in order to provide an overview of the neurophysiological mechanisms of social exclusion.
   Method: Literature search was conducted to identify neurophysiological studies that investigated effects of social exclusion on neural activity using the Cyberball game and the relevant influential factors on these effects.
   Results: In total, 42 studies using different neuroimaging methods were considered. Regions of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal and prefrontal cortex were activated to social exclusion. These neural activities were pronounced at latencies ranging from 200 to 400 ms, and between 400 and 900 ms. Influential factors were identified and categorized as intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   Conclusion: An integrated framework describing neural activities under social exclusion in terms of both, temporal and spatial processes is provided. Furthermore, the summary of influential intrinsic and extrinsic factors may help us to understand the diversity of the processes and may guide clinical therapy of stress related disorders.

AB  - Background: Satisfaction is seen as an indicator of the quality of mental health services and has been related to outcomes and compliance with treatment. The current review seeks to examine the factors relating to satisfaction with inpatient services.
   Method: A search was conducted of Psyclnfo, Web of Science, Cinahl, Embase and Medline databases. Screening resulted in 32 papers being included in the review. Papers were subject to quality assessment using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).
   Results: Review of the included papers suggested factors relating to satisfaction could be broadly classified as either service user or service/ward related. Service user related factors included findings that satisfaction was higher when service users were admitted voluntarily. Service related factors included findings that satisfaction was negatively associated with experiences of coercion and positively associated with being on an open ward.
   Conclusion: It appears that coercion has a key role in ratings of satisfaction. Additionally, service users reported an impact of staff relationships, and the ward environment. Satisfaction is associated with a range of factors, an awareness of which will allow for the development of quality services that meet the needs of service users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain (CHCHD)-containing proteins are evolutionarily conserved nucleus-encoded small mitochondrial proteins with important functions. So far, nine members have been identified in this protein family. All CHCHD proteins have at least one functional coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is stabilized by two pairs of disulfide bonds between two helices. CHCHD proteins have various important pathophysiological roles in mitochondria and other key cellular processes. Mutations of CHCHD proteins have been associated with various human neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations of CHCHD10 are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD), motor neuron disease, and late-onset spinal muscular atrophy and autosomal dominant mitochondrial myopathy. CHCHD10 stabilizes mitochondrial crista ultrastructure and maintains its integrity. In patients with CHCHD10 mutations, there are abnormal mitochondrial crista structure, deficiencies of respiratory chain complexes, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. Recently, CHCHD2 mutations are linked with autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). The CHCHD2 is a multifunctional protein and plays roles in regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, synthesis of respiratory chain components, and modulation of cell apoptosis. With a better understanding of the pathophysiologic roles of CHCHD proteins, they may be potential novel therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Sleep serves crucial learning and memory functions in both nervous and immune systems. Microglia are brain immune cells that actively maintain health through their crucial physiological roles exerted across the lifespan, including phagocytosis of cellular debris and orchestration of neuroinflammation. The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of microglial research. Considering the recent developments in the field of microglia and sleep, we examine their possible impact on various pathological conditions associated with a gain, disruption, or loss of sleep in this focused mini-review. While there are extensive studies of microglial implication in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, less is known regarding their roles in sleep disorders. It is timely to stimulate new research in this emergent and rapidly growing field of investigation.

AB  - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was first characterized as a survival-promoting molecule for dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Afterwards, other cells were also discovered to respond to GDNF not only as a survival factor but also as a protein supporting other cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, maturation, neurite outgrowth and other phenomena that have been less studied than survival and are now more extendedly described here in this review article. During development, GDNF favors the commitment of neural precursors towards dopaminergic, motor, enteric and adrenal neurons; in addition, it enhances the axonal growth of some of these neurons. GDNF also induces the acquisition of a dopaminergic phenotype by increasing the expression of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), Nurr1 and other proteins that confer this identity and promote further dendritic and electrical maturation. In motor neurons (MNs), GDNF not only promotes proliferation and maturation but also participates in regenerating damaged axons and modulates the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at both presynaptic and postsynaptic levels. Moreover, GDNF modulates the rate of neuroblastoma (NB) and glioblastoma cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, the presence or absence of GDNF has been correlated with conditions such as depression, pain, muscular soreness, etc. Although, the precise role of GDNF is unknown, it extends beyond a survival effect. The understanding of the complete range of properties of this trophic molecule will allow us to investigate its broad mechanisms of action to accelerate and/or improve therapies for the aforementioned pathological conditions.

AB  - Low-oxygen areas are expanding in the oceans as a result of climate change. Work carried out during the past two decades suggests that, in addition to impairing basic physiological functions, hypoxia can also affect fish behaviour. Given that many fish species are known to school, and that schooling is advantageous for their survival, the effect of hypoxia on schooling behaviour may have important ecological consequences. Here, we review the effects of hypoxia on school structure and dynamics, together with the mechanisms that cause an increase in school volume and that ultimately lead to school disruption. Furthermore, the effect of hypoxia generates a number of trade-offs in terms of schooling positions and school structure. Field observations have found that large schools of fish can exacerbate hypoxic conditions, with potential consequences for school structure and size. Therefore, previous models that predict the maximum size attainable by fish schools in relation to oxygen levels are also reviewed. Finally, we suggest that studies on the effect of hypoxia on schooling need to be integrated with those on temperature and ocean acidifications within a framework aimed at increasing our ability to predict the effect of multiple stressors of climate change on fish behaviour.

AB  - Group size is a fundamental component of sociality, and has important consequences for an individual's fitness as well as the collective and cooperative behaviours of the group as a whole. This review focuses on how the costs and benefits of group living vary in female primates as a function of group size, with a particular emphasis on how competition within and between groups affects an individual's energetic balance. Because the repercussions of chronic energetic stress can lower an animal's fitness, identifying the predictors of energetic stress has important implications for understanding variation in survivorship and reproductive success within and between populations. Notably, we extend previous literature on this topic by discussing three physiological measures of energetic balance-glucocorticoids, c-peptides and thyroid hormones. Because these hormones can provide clear signals of metabolic states and processes, they present an important complement to field studies of spatial and temporal changes in food availability. We anticipate that their further application will play a crucial role in elucidating the adaptive significance of group size in different social and ecological contexts.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Multiple genetic loci including genes involved in proteostasis and ribostasis have been linked to ALS providing key insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. In particular, the identification of the RNA binding proteins TDP-43 and fused in sarcoma (FUS) as causative factors of ALS resulted in a paradigm shift centered on the study of RNA dysregulation as a major mechanism of disease. With wild-type TDP-43 pathology being found in similar to 97% of ALS cases and the identification of disease causing mutations within its sequence, TDP-43 has emerged as a prominent player in ALS. More recently, studies of the newly discovered C9orf72 repeat expansion are lending further support to the notion of defects in RNA metabolism as a key factor underlying ALS. RNA binding proteins are involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism ranging from splicing, transcription, transport, storage into RNA/protein granules, and translation. How these processes are affected by disease-associated mutations is just beginning to be understood. Considerable work has gone into the identification of splicing and transcription defects resulting from mutations in RNA binding proteins associated with disease. More recently, defects in RNA transport and translation have been shown to be involved in the pathomechanism of ALS. A central hypothesis in the field is that disease causing mutations lead to the persistence of RNA/protein complexes known as stress granules. Under times of prolonged cellular stress these granules sequester specific mRNAs preventing them from translation, and are thought to evolve into pathological aggregates. Here we will review recent efforts directed at understanding how altered RNA metabolism contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: During the past decades deinstitutionalisation policies have led to a transition from inpatient towards community mental health care. Many European countries implement Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) as an alternative for inpatient care for "difficult to reach" children and adolescents with severe mental illness. ACT is a well-organized low-threshold treatment modality; patients are actively approached in their own environment, and efforts are undertaken to strengthen the patient's motivation for treatment. The assumption is that ACT may help to avoid psychiatric hospital admissions, enhance cost-effectiveness, stimulate social participation and support, and reduce stigma.
   ACT has been extensively investigated in adults with severe mental illness and various reviews support its effectiveness in this patient group. However, to date there is no review available regarding the effectiveness of youth-ACT. It is unknown whether youth-ACT is as effective as it is in adults. This review aims to assess the effects of youth-ACT on severity of psychiatric symptoms, general functioning, and psychiatric hospital admissions.
   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL published up to March 2017. To assess methodological quality of the included studies, the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine grading system was used.
   Results: Thirteen studies were included in this review. There are indications that youth-ACT is effective in reducing severity of psychiatric symptoms, improving general functioning, and reducing duration and frequency of psychiatric hospital admissions.
   Conclusions: The current literature on youth-ACT is limited but promising. There are indications that youth-ACT is effective in reducing severity of psychiatric symptoms, improving general functioning, and reducing duration and frequency of psychiatric hospital admissions. The effect of youth-ACT may be comparable with the effect of ACT in adults. Similar as in adult ACT, the studies on youth-ACT found effects that vary from small to large. Randomized experimental research designs are needed to further corroborate effectiveness.

AB  - The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) in Health and Health Care are a practical tool for health and health care organizations to improve their provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). Published by the Office of Minority Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National CLAS Standards provide health and health care organizations with a set of action steps for better meeting the needs of individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Few studies have examined the concept of CLAS or the National CLAS Standards, and they have rarely been extensively studied or reviewed. The authors conducted three literature searches between February 2014 and May 2015, examining the organizational challenges, applicability, and policy implications related to the National CLAS Standards or CLAS, and selected 55 articles for inclusion in the review. The literature highlights a number of challenges in implementing the National CLAS Standards and/ or providing CLAS, including issues related to the communication within health care organizations and the inconsistency of accountability measures. This literature review contributes to the growing knowledge base of the National CLAS Standards and CLAS in health and health care.

AB  - Imaging genetics and genomics research has begun to provide insight into the molecular and genetic architecture of neural phenotypes and the neural mechanisms through which genetic risk for psychopathology may emerge. As it approaches its third decade, imaging genetics is confronted by many challenges, including the proliferation of studies using small sample sizes and diverse designs, limited replication, problems with harmonization of neural phenotypes for meta-analysis, unclear mechanisms, and evidence that effect sizes may be more modest than originally posited, with increasing evidence of polygenicity. These concerns have encouraged the field to grow in many new directions, including the development of consortia and large-scale data collection projects and the use of novel methods (e.g., polygenic approaches, machine learning) that enhance the quality of imaging genetic studies but also introduce new challenges. We critically review progress in imaging genetics and offer suggestions and highlight potential pitfalls of novel approaches. Ultimately, the strength of imaging genetics and genomics lies in their translational and integrative potential with other research approaches (e.g., nonhuman animal models, psychiatric genetics, pharmacologic challenge) to elucidate brain-based pathways that give rise to the vast individual differences in behavior as well as risk for psychopathology.

KW  - BIAS
AB  - Background. The financial exploitation of older adults was recently recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a serious public health problem. Knowledge of the prevalence of elder financial exploitation is mostly limited to the category of financial abuse, which occurs in relationships involving an expectation of trust. Little is known about the other major category of elder financial exploitation-elder financial fraud and scams, which is perpetrated by strangers. A valid estimate of elder financial fraud-scam prevalence is necessary as a foundation for research and prevention efforts.
   Objectives. To estimate the prevalence of elder financial fraud-scam victimization in the United States based on a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Search Methods. Multiple investigators independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed relevant full-text records from PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, and AgeLine databases.
   Selection Criteria. To maximize the validity and generalizability of prevalence estimation, we restricted eligibility to general populationbased studies (English speaking, 1990 onward) using state-or national-level probability sampling and collecting data directly from older adults.
   Data Collection and Analysis. Information on elder financial fraud-scam prevalence and study-level characteristics was extracted independently by 2 investigators. Meta-analysis of elder financial fraud-scam prevalence used generalized mixed models with individual studies as levels of a random classification factor.
   Main Results. We included 12 studies involving a total of 41 711 individuals in the meta-analysis. Overall pooled elder financial fraud-scam prevalence (up to 5-year period) across studies was 5.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0%, 7.8%), with a 1-year period prevalence of 5.4% (95% CI = 3.2%, 7.6%). Studies using a series of questions describing specific fraud-scam events to measure victimization found a significantly higher prevalence (7.1%; 95% CI = 4.8%, 9.4%) than studies using a single, generalquestion self-report assessment approach (3.6%; 95% CI = 1.8%, 5.4%). ]'s
   Conclusions. Elder financial fraud and scams is a common problem, affecting approximately 1 of every 18 cognitively intact, community-dwelling older adults each year; it requires further attention from researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Elder financial fraud-scam prevalence findings in this study likely underestimate the true population prevalence. We provide methodological recommendations to limit older adult participation and reporting bias in future population-based research.
   Public Health Implications. Elder financial exploitation victimization is associated with mortality, hospitalization, and poor physical and mental health. Health care professionals working with older adults likely routinely encounter patients who are fraud-scam victims. Validation of instruments to screen for elder financial fraud and scams in clinical settings is an important area of future research. Without effective primary prevention strategies, the absolute scope of this problem will escalate with the growing population of older adults.

AB  - The phenomenology of delay discounting (e.g. shape of the discount function; relation to mental health) has been reviewed in detail previously, but not its neural substrates. Its neuropsychology is crucial for both theory and clinical practice. So, here, we review the neural underpinnings of delay discounting. We introduce its objective summary measures; provide an atheoretical summary of current findings - linking brain regions to each objectively measurable variable; and then provide a preliminary five-stage summary model of cognitive processing; followed by a mapping of parameters to the flow of information through neural systems. The whole is designed to stimulate future research on the roles of each brain region in delay discounting. Delay and payoff produce activity in many brain areas: thalamus; sensory, parietal, temporal, cingulate, prefrontal, motor, and insular cortex; and basal ganglia. Delay discounting, then, appears to emerge from the interaction of neural systems as they process streams of events in recurrent loops and not to be a simple calculation carried out in a single center in the brain.

AB  - The field of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is dominated by research conducted with Caucasian-majority samples in Western countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and European countries. This article critically reviewed the empirical research on NSSI in non-Western countries and among ethnic/racial minority individuals who live in the West to give voice to and understand the patterns of NSSI among individuals who do not fall within the dominant Caucasian majority. The study found both similarities and differences between Western and non-Western data in terms of characteristics and functions of NSSI. Differences in gender patterns in regards to prevalence of NSSI and methods used as well as presence of a more relational functionality of NSSI rather than emotion regulation functionality were two points of divergence in the findings of these studies. In addition, the findings seem to indicate that the role of ethnicity/race is mediated by important factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Existing gaps in the literature and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Aim Prevention plays a crucial part in healthcare systems and is greatly influenced by the health and risk behavior of the population. The extent to which special tailoring to the addressed subjects would be helpful in improving the effectiveness of prevention measures is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review is to assess gender-specific differences in primary prevention actions.
   Subject and Methods A systematic review was conducted in 2015 by searching the PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane Library databases as well as adding additional studies by cross-referencing. The search focused on studies with an analysis of gender differences in health and risk behavior concerning primary prevention. Therefore, major exclusion criteria were single-gender studies, underage (< 18 years) study collectives and secondary or tertiary prevention measures.
   Results In total, 23 studies from 13 different countries were included in the qualitative evaluation. The studies covered 11 different subtopics of primary prevention, but were too diverse in content and type to draw many fundamental conclusions. A meta-analysis was not possible. Generally a tendency for females to be more health-conscious and engaged in preventive behavior could be seen in most subgroups.
   Conclusion The importance of gender-specific prevention measures for the healthcare system is being increasingly stressed, but only a few studies specifically analyzing the influence of gender on preventive behavior could be identified. To implement appropriate primary prevention measures tailored to gender-specific needs, more details and studies on gender differences are needed.

The aim of this study was to systematically review available epidemiological studies of ASD in this region to identify gaps in our current knowledge.
   Methods: We searched, collected and evaluated articles published between January 1962 and July 2016 which reported the prevalence of ASD in eight South Asian countries. The search was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: We identified six articles from Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka which met our predefined inclusion criteria. The reported prevalence of ASD in South Asia ranged from 0.09% in India to 1.07% in Sri Lanka that indicates up to one in 93 children have ASD in this region. Alarmingly high prevalence (3%) was reported in Dhaka city. Study sample sizes ranged from 374 in Sri Lanka to 18,480 in India. The age range varied between 1 and 30 years. No studies were found which reported the prevalence of ASD in Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Afghanistan. This review identifies methodological differences in case definition, screening instruments and diagnostic criteria among reported three countries which make it very difficult to compare the studies.
   Conclusions: Our study is an attempt at understanding the scale of the problem and scarcity of information regarding ASD in the South Asia. This study will contribute to the evidence base needed to design further research and make policy decisions on addressing this issue in this region. Knowing the prevalence of ASD in South Asia is vital to ensure the effective allocation of resources and services.

AB  - Objectives: Fatigue is a prevalent and debilitating symptom, preceded by an acute infectious episode in some patients. This systematic review aimed to identify risk factors for the development of persistent fatigue after an acute infection, to develop an evidence-based working model of post-infectious fatigue.
   Methods: Electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE) were searched, from inception to March 2016, for studies which investigated biopsychosocial risk factors of on-going fatigue after an acute infection. Inclusion criteria were: prospective design; biological, psychological or social risk factors; standardised measure of post infectious fatigue (self-report scales or clinical diagnosis). Studies were excluded if the sample had a pre-existing medical condition, infection was conceptualised as 'vaccination' or they were intervention trials. A narrative synthesis was performed.
   Results: Eighty-one full texts were screened, of which seventeen were included in the review. Over half included glandular fever populations. Other infections included dengue fever, 'generartviral' and Q-fever. Risk factors were summarised under biological, social, behavioural, cognitive and emotional subthemes. Patients' cognitive and behavioural responses to the acute illness, and pre-infection or baseline distress and fatigue were the most consistent risk factors for post-infectious fatigue.
   Conclusion: An empirical summary model is provided, highlighting the risk factors most consistently associated with persistent fatigue. The components of the model, the possible interaction of risk factors and implications for understanding the fatigue trajectory and informing preventative treatments are discussed.

AB  - Background Professional burnout predicts sick leave and even permanent withdrawal from the labour force. However, knowledge of the barriers to and facilitators of return to work (RTW) in such burnout is limited.
   Aims To identify factors associated with RTW of burned-out individuals to inform occupational health care (OHC) RTW policy.
   Methods A systematic search of peer-reviewed quantitative and mixed-method studies published from January 2005 to July 2016 in English and Finnish in ARTO, CINAHL (EBSCO), Medic, PsycINFO (ProQuest), PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases, followed by a manual search. We included studies that identify burnout with valid burnout measures and measure the degree of RTW or sick leave as outcomes. We excluded studies with heterogeneous samples without subgroup analyses of RTW in burnout cases.
   Results We included 10 studies (three experimental and seven observational) of the initial 1345 identified. The studies reported work-related factors; enhanced communication (positive association) and low control at work (negative association) and individual-related factors; male gender (positive association), covert coping (negative association), high over-commitment to work (positive association) and burnout-related factors; unimpaired sleep (positive association), duration of sick leave over 6 months (negative association) and part-time sick leave (positive association) associated with RTW in burnout. Associations between burnout rehabilitation and RTW, and the level of symptoms and cognitive impairment and RTW remained unclear.
   Conclusions Few quantitative studies, of varied methodological quality, explore factors associated with RTW in burnout. Further research is needed to build an evidence base and develop guidelines for supportive OHC actions.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the published clinical trials, case series, and case reports on left unilateral (LUL) electrode placement for clinical electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
   Method: PubMed, Ovid Medline, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles concerning LUL ECT. Number of patients, efficacy, and cognitive outcomes were extracted from the papers that met our inclusion criteria.
   Results: A total of 52 articles were included in this review, consisting of 33 clinical trials, seven case series, and 12 case reports.
   Conclusion: Overall, the efficacy of LUL electrode placement for the treatment of depression and psychosis is similar to that of right unilateral (RUL) and bilateral (BL) electrode placements. Patients receiving LUL ECT tend to experience more verbal memory impairment than patients receiving RUL ECT, but less verbal impairment than patients receiving BL ECT. In contrast, patients receiving LUL ECT tended to experience the least visual and nonverbal memory impairment, compared to patients receiving RUL or BL ECT.

AB  - NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are critical cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that play an important role in the host innate immune response and immunity homeostasis. There is a growing body of evidence that NLRs are involved in a wide range of inflammatory diseases, including cancer, metabolic diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Recent studies have indicated that the proteins of the NLR family are linked with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), and psychological diseases. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of NLRs and the underlying signaling pathways in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and localized neuroinflammation occurring in the midbrain several years before the actual onset of symptoms. Neuroinflammation leads to microglia activation and release of a large number of proinflammatory mediators. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan catabolism is one of the major regulators of the immune response and is also likely to be implicated in the inflammatory and neurotoxic events in Parkinsonism. Several neuroactive compounds are produced through the KP that can be either a neurotoxic, neuroprotective or immunomodulator. Among these metabolites kynurenic acid (KYNA), produced by astrocytes, is considered as neuroprotective whereas quinolinic acid (QUIN), released by activated microglia, can activate the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-signalling pathway, leading to excitotoxicity and amplify the inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that NMDA antagonists can ease symptoms and exert a neuroprotective effect in PD both in vivo and in vitro. There are to date several lines of evidence linking some of the KP intermediates and the neuropathogenesis of PD. Moreover, it is likely that some of the KP metabolites could be used as prognostic biomarkers and that pharmacological modulators of the KP enzymes could represent a new therapeutic strategy for PD.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are vital ecosystems in coastal zones worldwide, but are also under global threat. One of the major hurdles restricting the success of seagrass conservation and restoration is our limited understanding of ecological feedback mechanisms. In these ecosystems, multiple, self-reinforcing feedbacks can undermine conservation efforts by masking environmental impacts until the decline is precipitous, or alternatively they can inhibit seagrass recovery in spite of restoration efforts. However, no clear framework yet exists for identifying or dealing with feedbacks to improve the management of seagrass ecosystems. Here we review the causes and consequences of multiple feedbacks between seagrass and biotic and/or abiotic processes. We demonstrate how feedbacks have the potential to impose or reinforce regimes of either seagrass dominance or unvegetated substrate, and how the strength and importance of these feedbacks vary across environmental gradients. Although a myriad of feedbacks have now been identified, the co-occurrence and likely interaction among feedbacks has largely been overlooked to date due to difficulties in analysis and detection. Here we take a fundamental step forward by modelling the interactions among two distinct above-and belowground feedbacks to demonstrate that interacting feedbacks are likely to be important for ecosystem resilience. On this basis, we propose a five-step adaptive management plan to address feedback dynamics for effective conservation and restoration strategies. The management plan provides guidance to aid in the identification and prioritisation of likely feedbacks in different seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - The field of clinical animal behavior has a growing scientific basis, with three main paradigms having different perspectives on the assessment of animal emotion. The Behavioral approach, grounded in classical behaviorism, makes little reference to emotion in assessment, despite covert recognition of its importance. The Medical approach, drawing on human psychiatric approaches, emphasizes the importance of physical evidence (behavior descriptions and physiological parameters) for validation of diagnoses centred on abnormality and disorder. The more recent Psychobiological approach synthesizes affective neuroscience, ethology and psychology to propose a systematic and rational framework for making inferences about emotion, that result in the construction of testable (falsifiable) hypotheses relating to four domains derived from component process theory using field -based evidence.

AB  - Background: Diet plays a key role in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to review systematically observational studies available regarding the relationship between food intakes and NAFLD.
   Methods: We searched Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases to identify English observational studies on food groups, dietary patterns, and NAFLD. Cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies were selected and then duplication, topic, type of study, study population, variables examined and quality of data reporting of the articles were evaluated.
   Results: We identified 2128 studies in the initial search, of which 33 were reviewed in full text and 7 articles were included in this systematic review. Intakes of red meat, fats, and sweets were high whereas consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables were less in NAFLD patients. Moreover, there was a positive association between the Western dietary pattern and the risk of NAFLD, while adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.
   Conclusion: Generally, different food group intakes and dietary patterns are associated with the progression of NAFLD and its risk factors. Because of the many limitations of available studies reviewed on this topic, more prospective studies are suggested.

AB  - The identification of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) GGGGCC (G4C2) in the non-coding region of the C9ORF72 gene as the most frequent genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has opened the path for advances in the knowledge and treatment of these disorders, which remain incurable. Recent evidence suggests that HRE RNA can cause gain-of-function neurotoxicity, but haploinsufficiency has also been hypothesized. In this review, we describe the recent developments in therapeutic targeting of the pathological expansion of C9ORF72 for ALS, FTD, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Three approaches are prominent: (1) an antisense oligonucleotides/RNA interference strategy; (2) using small compounds to counteract the toxic effects directly exerted by RNA derived from the repeat transcription (foci), by the translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) from the repeated sequence, or by the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins from the C9ORF72 expansion; and (3) gene therapy, not only for silencing the toxic RNA/protein, but also for rescuing haploinsufficiency caused by the reduced transcription of the C9ORF72 coding sequence or by the diminished availability of RNA-binding proteins that are sequestered by RNA foci. Finally, with the perspective of clinical therapy, we discuss the most promising progress that has been achieved to date in the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several published studies have reported an association between antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation agents, and a decline in gray matter volume. This prompted us to review the possible neurotoxic mechanisms of first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), especially haloperidol, which has been widely used over the past several decades.
   METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted using the keywords haloperidol, antipsychotic, neurotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. No restrictions were placed on the date of the articles or language. Studies with a clearly described methodology were included.
   RESULTS: Animal, cell culture, and human tissue studies were identified. Thirty reports met the criteria for the search. All studies included haloperidol; a few also included other FGAs (fluphenazine and perphenazine) and/or second-generation agents (SGAs) (aripiprazole, paliperidone, and risperidone). A neurotoxic effect of haloperidol and other FGAs was a common theme across all studies. Minimal (mainly at high doses) or no neurotoxic effects were noted in SGAs.
   CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature suggests that haloperidol exerts measurable neurotoxic effects at all doses via many molecular mechanisms that lead to neuronal death. A similar effect was observed in 2 other FGAs, but the effect in SGAs was much smaller and occurred mainly at high doses. A stronger binding to serotonin 5HT-2A receptors than to dopamine D2 receptors may have a neuroprotective effect among SGAs. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background Despite substantial attention paid to the threat of elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents in high-income countries and the epidemic of hypertension in African adult populations, data on the burden of elevated blood pressure in African children and adolescents have not yet been synthesised. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide estimates of the prevalence of elevated blood pressure and assess associated factors among children and adolescents in Africa.
   Methods We searched Embase, PubMed, African Journals Online, and African Index Medicus to identify articles published from Jan 1, 1996, to Feb 2, 2017, and searched the reference list of retrieved articles. Each study was independently reviewed for methodological quality. We used a random-effects model to estimate the prevalence of elevated blood pressure across studies and heterogeneity (I-2) was assessed via the. (2) test on Cochran's Q statistic. This review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015019029.
   Findings We included 51 studies in qualitative synthesis and 25 in the meta-analysis reporting data of a pooled sample of 54 196 participants aged 2-19 years. Study quality was high with only four medium-quality studies and no low-quality studies. Prevalence of elevated blood pressure varied widely across studies (range 0.2-24.8%). The pooled prevalence of elevated blood pressure (systolic or diastolic blood pressure >= 95th percentile) was 5.5% (95% CI 4.2-6.9), whereas that of slightly elevated blood pressure (systolic or diastolic blood pressure >= 90th percentile and <95th percentile) was 12.7% (2.1-30.4). The prevalence of elevated blood pressure was largely associated with body-mass index (BMI), with a prevalence of elevated blood pressure six times higher in obese (30.8%, 95% CI 20.1-42.6) versus normal-weight children (5.5%, 3.1-8.4; p<0.0001).
   Interpretation This study suggests a high prevalence of elevated blood pressure among children and adolescents in Africa, with overweight and obesity being an important risk factor. Efforts to address this burden of elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents should mainly focus on primary prevention at the community level, by promoting healthy lifestyles and avoiding other cardiovascular risk factors, especially overweight and obesity. This study also stresses the need for more elaborate studies using uniform and reliable diagnostic methods to reliably map the burden of elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents in Africa.

AB  - Genetic-neuroimaging paradigms could provide insights regarding the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). Nevertheless, findings have been inconsistent across studies. A systematic review of gene-imaging studies involving individuals with BD was conducted across electronic major databases from inception until January 9th, 2017. Forty-four studies met eligibility criteria (N= 2122 BD participants). Twenty-six gene variants were investigated across candidate gene studies and 4 studies used a genome-wide association approach. Replicated evidence (i.e. in> 2 studies) suggests that individuals with BD carrying the BDNF Val66Met risk allele could have reduced hippocampal volumes compared to non-carriers. This review underscores the potential of gene-neuroimaging paradigms to provide mechanistic insights for BD. However, this systematic review found a single replicated finding. Suggestions to improve the reproducibility of this emerging field are provided, including the adoption of a trans-diagnostic approach.

AB  - The dorsal frontoparietal network (dFPN) of the human brain assumes a puzzling variety of functions, including motor planning and imagery, mental rotation, spatial attention, and working memory. How can a single network engage in such a diversity of roles? We propose that cognitive computations relying on the dFPN can be pinned down to a core function underlying offline motor planning: action emulation. Emulation creates a dynamic representation of abstract movement kinematics, sustains the internal manipulation of this representation, and ensures its maintenance over short time periods. Based on these fundamental characteristics, the dFPN has evolved from a pure motor control network into a domain-general system supporting various cognitive and motor functions.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of midbrain nigral dopaminergic neurons. Although its etiology remains unknown, the pathological role of several factors has been highlighted, namely oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and mitochondrial dysfunction, in addition to genetic predispositions. The current therapy is mainly symptomatic with L-DOPA aiming to replace dopamine. Novel therapeutic approaches are being investigated with the intention of influencing pathways leading to neuronal death and dysfunction. The present review summarizes three novel approaches, the use of which is promising in pre-clinical studies. Polyphenols have been shown to possess neuroprotective properties on account of their well-established antioxidative and anti-inflammatory actions but also due to their influence on protein misfolding and mitochondrial homeostasis. Within the amazing ancillary effects of antibiotics, their neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes are of great interest for the development of effective therapies against Parkinson's disease. Experimental evidence supports the potential of antibiotics as neuroprotective agents, being useful not only to prevent the formation of toxic a-synuclein oligomers but also to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Neuropeptides offer another approach with their diverse effects in the nervous system. Among them, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, a member of the secretin/glucagon superfamily, has several advantageous effects inmodels of neurodegeneration, namely anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, the combination of which offers a potent protective effect in dopaminergic neurons. Owing to their pleiotropic modes of action, these novel therapeutic candidates have potential in tackling the multidimensional features of Parkinson's disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Approximately half of the global refugee population are women, yet they remain largely understudied from the perspective of gender. The aim of this review was to investigate the impact of refugee women's resettlement and socio-cultural experiences on their health. This review also explored factors promoting resilience in refugee women. Eight databases were searched for peer-reviewed manuscripts published from 2005 to 2014. Grey literature was also reviewed. Data were extracted for population, data collection methods, data analysis, and findings. The Resource-Based Model was used as an overarching framework for data synthesis. Following the screening of titles and abstracts, 20 studies met the study inclusion criteria. Cultural factors, social and material factors, personal factors, and resilience factors were identified as main themes influencing the health of refugee women. Promotion of factors that enables resettlement is important in promoting the health and wellbeing of refugee women.

An extensive search retrieved nine reports which provided 21 meta-analyses analyses. Data were extracted by two reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR Instrument.
   Most effect sizes were small but high quality studies showed significant outcomes for reduced low birth weight (RR = 0.60), repeat pregnancies/births (OR = 0.47-0.62), maternal education (OR = 1.21-1.83), and maternal employment (OR = 1.26). Several parenting outcomes (parent-child teaching interaction post-intervention [SMD = -0.91] and at follow-up [SMD = -1.07], and parent-child relationship post-intervention [SMD = -0.71] and at follow-up [SMD = -0.90]) were significant, but sample sizes were very small. Many reports did not include moderator analyses.
   Behavioral interventions offer limited resources and occur too late to mitigate the educational and social disparities that precede teen pregnancy. Future intervention research and policies that redress the social determinants of early childbearing are recommended. (C) 2017 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB  - Obesity and depression are prevalent complications during pregnancy and associated with severe health risks for the mother and the child. The co-occurrence of both conditions may lead to a particular high-risk group. This review provides a systematic overview of the association between pre-pregnancy obesity and antenatal or postnatal depression. We conducted a systematic electronic literature search for English language articles published between January 1990 and March 2017. Inclusion criteria were (a) adult pregnant women, (b) women with pre-pregnancy obesity and normal weight controls, (c) definition of obesity according to the IOM 1990/2009 criteria, (d) established depression measure, and (e) report on the association between pre-pregnancy obesity and antenatal or postnatal depression. Fourteen (eight prospective (PS), six cross-sectional (CS)) studies were included. One study reported data from a large community-based sample, and one reported cross-national data. Of 13 studies examining pre-pregnancy obesity and antenatal depression, 9 found a higher risk or higher levels of antenatal depression among women with obesity relative to normal weight (6 PS, 3 CS), while 4 studies found no association (2 PS, 2 CS). Of four studies examining pre-pregnancy obesity and postnatal depression, two studies found a positive association (two PS), one study (CS) reported different findings for different obesity classes, and one study found none (PS). The findings suggest that women with obesity are especially vulnerable to antenatal depression. There is a need to develop appropriate screening routines and targeted interventions to mitigate negative health consequences for the mother and the child. Research addressing the association between obesity and postnatal depression is too limited to draw solid conclusions. Results are mainly based on selective samples, and there is a need for further high-quality prospective studies examining the association between pre-pregnancy obesity and antenatal and postnatal depression.

AB  - There are several interrelated mechanisms involving iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin in neurons. Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus, the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron, however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact, increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however, excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin, and this process rescues the cell. Interestingly, the main iron compound in dopamine and norepinephrine neurons is the neuromelanin-iron complex, since neuromelanin is an effective metal chelator. Neuromelanin serves to trap iron and provide neuronal protection from oxidative stress. This equilibrium between iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin is crucial for cell homeostasis and in some cellular circumstances can be disrupted. Indeed, when neuromelanin-containing organelles accumulate high load of toxins and iron during aging a neurodegenerative process can be triggered. In addition, neuromelanin released by degenerating neurons activates microglia and the latter cause neurons death with further release of neuromelanin, then starting a self-propelling mechanism of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Considering the above issues, age-related accumulation of neuromelanin in dopamine neurons shows an interesting link between aging and neurodegeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Meaning-making in the brain has become one of the most intensely discussed topics in cognitive science. Traditional theories on cognition that emphasize abstract symbol manipulations often face a dead end: The symbol grounding problem. The embodiment idea tries to overcome this barrier by assuming that the mind is grounded in sensorimotor experiences. A recent surge in behavioral and brain-imaging studies has therefore focused on the role of the motor cortex in language processing. Concrete, action-related words have received convincing evidence to rely on sensorimotor activation. Abstract concepts, however, still pose a distinct challenge for embodied theories on cognition. Fully embodied abstraction mechanisms were formulated but sensorimotor activation alone seems unlikely to close the explanatory gap. In this respect, the idea of integration areas, such as convergence zones or the 'hub and spoke' model, do not only appear like the most promising candidates to account for the discrepancies between concrete and abstract concepts but could also help to unite the field of cognitive science again. The current review identifies milestones in cognitive science research and recent achievements that highlight fundamental challenges, key questions and directions for future research.

AB  - Background: Air pollution is involved in many pathologies. These pollutants act through several mechanisms that can affect numerous physiological functions, including reproduction: as endocrine disruptors or reactive oxygen species inducers, and through the formation of DNA adducts and/or epigenetic modifications. We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the impact of air pollution on reproductive function.
   Eligible studies were selected from an electronic literature search from the PUBMED database from January 2000 to February 2016 and associated references in published studies. Search terms included (1) ovary or follicle or oocyte or testis or testicular or sperm or spermatozoa or fertility or infertility and (2) air quality or O-3 or NO2 or PM2.5 or diesel or SO2 or traffic or PM10 or air pollution or air pollutants. The literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We have included the human and animal studies corresponding to the search terms and published in English. We have excluded articles whose results did not concern fertility or gamete function and those focused on cancer or allergy. We have also excluded genetic, auto-immune or iatrogenic causes of reduced reproduction function from our analysis. Finally, we have excluded animal data that does not concern mammals and studies based on results from in vitro culture. Data have been grouped according to the studied pollutants in order to synthetize their impact on fertility and the molecular pathways involved.
   Conclusion: Both animal and human epidemiological studies support the idea that air pollutants cause defects during gametogenesis leading to a drop in reproductive capacities in exposed populations. Air quality has an impact on overall health as well as on the reproductive function, so increased awareness of environmental protection issues is needed among the general public and the authorities.

AB  - Background: In South Africa (SA), despite adoption of international strategies and approaches, maternal, neonatal and child (MNC) morbidity and mortality rates have not sufficiently declined.
   Objectives: To conduct an umbrella review (UR) that identifies interventions in low-and middle-income countries, with a high-quality evidence base, that improve MNC morbidity and mortality outcomes within the first 1000 days of life; and to assess the incorporation of the evidence into local strategies, guidelines and documents.
   Methods: We included publications about women and children in the first 1000 days of life; healthcare professionals and community members. Comparators were those who did not receive the intervention. Interventions were pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Outcomes were MNC morbidity and mortality. Authors conducted English language electronic and manual searches (2000-2013). The quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) were reviewed. Interventions were ranked according to level of evidence; and then aligned with SA strategies, policies and guidelines. A tool to extract data was developed and used by two authors who independently extracted data. Summary measures from MAs or summaries of SRs were reviewed and the specificities of the various interventions listed. A search of all local high-level documents was done and these were assessed to determine the specificities of the recommendations and their alignment to the evidence.
   Results: In total, 19 interventions presented in 32 SRs were identified. Overall, SA's policy-makers have sufficiently included high-quality evidence-based interventions into local policies. However, optimal period of birth spacing (two to five years) is not explicitly promoted nor was ante-and postnatal depression adequately incorporated. Antenatal care visits should be increased from four to about eight according to the evidence.
   Conclusion: Incorporation of existing evidence into policies can be strengthened in SA. The UR methods are useful to inform policymaking and identify research gaps.

AB  - Background: People with severe mental ill health are more likely to smoke than those in the general population. It is therefore important that effective smoking cessation strategies are used to help people with severe mental ill health to stop smoking. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost - effectiveness of smoking cessation and reduction strategies in adults with severe mental ill health in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
   Methods: This is an update of a previous systematic review. Electronic databases were searched during September 2016 for randomised controlled trials comparing smoking cessation interventions to each other, usual care, or placebo. Data was extracted on biochemically-verified, self-reported smoking cessation (primary outcome), as well as on smoking reduction, body weight, psychiatric symptom, and adverse events (secondary outcomes).
   Results: We included 26 trials of pharmacological and/or behavioural interventions. Eight trials comparing bupropion to placebo were pooled showing that bupropion improved quit rates significantly in the medium and long term but not the short term (short term RR = 6.42 95% CI 0.82-50.07; medium term RR = 2.93 95% CI 1.61-5. 34; long term RR = 3.04 95% CI 1.10-8.42). Five trials comparing varenicline to placebo showed that that the addition of varenicline improved quit rates significantly in the medium term (RR = 4.13 95% CI 1.36-12.53). The results from five trials of specialised smoking cessation programmes were pooled and showed no evidence of benefit in the medium (RR = 1.32 95% CI 0.85-2.06) or long term (RR = 1.33 95% CI 0.85-2.08). There was insufficient data to allowing pooling for all time points for varenicline and trials of specialist smoking cessation programmes. Trials suggest few adverse events although safety data were not always reported. Only one pilot study reported cost effectiveness data.
   Conclusions: Bupropion and varenicline, which have been shown to be effective in the general population, also work for people with severe mental ill health and their use in patients with stable psychiatric conditions. Despite good evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for people with severe mental ill health, the percentage of people with severe mental ill health who smoke remains higher than that for the general population.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury is among the most common causes of death and disability in youth and young adults. In addition to the acute risk of morbidity with moderate to severe injuries, traumatic brain injury is associated with a number of chronic neurological and neuropsychiatric sequelae including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injuries and the established clinical correlation with neurodegeneration, the causative factors linking these processes have not yet been fully elucidated. Apart from removal from activity, few, if any prophylactic treatments against post-traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration exist. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and neurodegeneration in order to identify potential factors that initiate neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity have previously been implicated in both secondary brain injury and neurodegeneration. In particular, reactive oxygen species appear to be key in mediating molecular insult in neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity. As such, it is likely that post injury oxidative stress is a key mechanism which links traumatic brain injury to increased risk of neurodegeneration. Consequently, reactive oxygen species and their subsequent by products may serve as novel fluid markers for identification and monitoring of cellular damage. Furthermore, these reactive species may further serve as a suitable therapeutic target to reduce the risk of post-injury neurodegeneration and provide long term quality of life improvements for those suffering from traumatic brain injury.

AB  - The advantages of ultra-high-field (UHF >= 7T) MR have been demonstrated in a variety of MR acquisition modalities. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can particularly benefit from substantial gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution at UHF, enabling the quantification of numerous metabolites, including glutamate, glutamine, glutathione, and gamma-aminobutyric acid that are relevant to psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to give an overview about the advantages and advances of UHF MRS and its application to psychiatric disorders. In order to provide a practical guide for potential applications of MRS at UHF, a literature review is given, surveying advantages and disadvantages of MRS at UHF. Key concepts, emerging technologies, practical considerations, and applications of UHF MRS are provided. Second, the strength of UHF MRS is demonstrated using some examples of its application in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: The use of telemedicine in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) represents some of the earliest technology-enabled interventions in mental health. A review of telemedicine efficacy data in OCD provides a window into the telemental revolution and informs us on the best-supported technology tools in OCD treatment.
   Methods: A PubMed database search of efficacy studies was conducted across telemental health platforms-computerized, internet, mobile, and virtual reality based.
   Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified covering computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), online CBT and virtual reality exposure therapy. Studies included children, adolescents and adults, and represented various levels of clinician involvement (therapist-free, limited or full), as well as non-therapist support ("coach", technician or parent).
   Discussion: The best-supported modality represents CBT interventions in mild to moderate OCD, delivered over computerized, online or virtual reality platforms. No controlled data were retrieved on non-CBT psychotherapies, psychopharmacology, or mobile interventions. Overall, the hypothesis that adequate care can be delivered with minimal clinician involvement has motivated much research; while this could increase access and diminish cost, it might turn away some providers and patients.
   Conclusion: Several platforms as well as psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments remain untested. Meanwhile, a case can be made for using technology-mediated CBT in mild to moderate OCD, then escalated to interventions with more clinician involvement and a broader evidence base.

AB  - Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding Parkin and PINK1 are causally linked to autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and PINK1, a mitochondrial-targeted kinase, function together in a common pathway to remove dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy. Presumably, deficiency for Parkin or PINK1 impairs mitochondrial autophagy and thereby increases oxidative stress due to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that release reactive oxygen species. Parkin and PINK1 likely have additional functions that may be relevant to the mechanisms by which mutations in these genes cause neurodegeneration, such as regulating inflammation, apoptosis, or dendritic morphogenesis. Here we briefly review what is known about functions of Parkin and PINK1 related to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review is designed to systematically examine the available evidence about virtual reality exposure therapy's (VRET) efficacy for phobias, critically describe some of the most important challenges in the field and discuss possible directions. Evidence reveals that virtual reality (VR) is an effective treatment for phobias and useful for studying specific issues, such as pharmacological compounds and behavioral manipulations, that can enhance treatment outcomes. In addition, some variables, such as sense of presence in virtual environments, have a significant influence on outcomes, but further research is needed to better understand their role in therapeutic outcomes. We conclude that VR is a useful tool to improve exposure therapy and it can be a good option to analyze the processes and mechanisms involved in exposure therapy and the ways this strategy can be enhanced. In the coming years, there will be a significant expansion of VR in routine practice in clinical contexts.

KW  - FEAR
KW  - DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Flight anxiety and the fear-related avoidance draw serious personal and financial negative consequences. Although classical exposure techniques for flight anxiety are widely used, they involve significant limits. Efforts to develop the benefits and access to evidence-based psychotherapies have led to a new method of delivering exposure technique, namely virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). Until now, there has been no meta-analysis which assumed as a primary objective the analysis of VRET effectiveness in flight anxiety.
   Methods: The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of VRET interventions for flight anxiety compared to various control conditions, at post-test and follow-up. We conducted a quantitative review of 11 randomized studies, we examined potential moderators of the efficacy of interventions and we investigated the presence and the degree of publication bias.
   Results: Results pointed out significant overall efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety at post-test and follow-up. Analysis highlighted the superiority of VRET vs. control conditions at post-test and follow-up and the superiority of VRET vs. classical evidence-based interventions at post-test and follow-up. Results revealed similar efficacy between VRET and exposure based interventions at post-test, and showed better treatment gains over time when using VRET vs. exposure based interventions. Moderation analyses revealed that low quality trials, with smaller and younger samples led to a larger effect size of VRET for flight anxiety. Also, outcome types, the number of exposure sessions and follow-up intervals were significant moderators of the efficiency of VRET in this disorder.
   Conclusions: The present meta-analysis supports the efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety and encourages the use of this type of exposure both in clinical practice and research field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate self-awareness is essential for adapting one's behaviour to one's actual abilities, to avoid risky behaviour. Impaired self-awareness of deficits is common in neurodegenerative diseases. Numerous studies show an involvement of midline cortical areas in impaired self-awareness. Among the other brain regions implicated stand the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (i.e. hippocampus, amygdala, and temporopolar, entorhinal, perirhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices). This review aims at evaluating the role of those structures in self-awareness in neurodegenerative diseases. To this aim, we briefly review impaired self-awareness in neurodegenerative diseases, give a neuroanatomical background on the MTL structures, and report those identified in neuroimaging studies on self-awareness. The MTL shows neuropathological, and structural or functional changes in patients who overestimate their abilities in the cognitive, socio-emotional or daily life activities domains. The structures implicated differ depending on the domain considered, suggesting a modality-specific involvement. The functional significance of the findings is discussed in view of the neuroanatomical networks of the MTL and in the context of theoretical models of self-awareness.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that one mechanism through which physical activity provides benefits to cognition and mood is via increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. Some studies have reported immediate benefits to mood and various cognitive domains after a single session of exercise. This meta-analysis sought to determine the effect of a single exercise session on concentrations of BDNF in peripheral blood, in order to evaluate the potential role of BDNF in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Rehabilitation & Sports Medicine Source, and CINAHL databases were searched for original, peer-reviewed reports of peripheral blood BDNF concentrations before and after acute exercise interventions. Risk of bias within studies was assessed using standardized criteria. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were generated from random effects models. Risk of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored in subgroup analyses. In 55 studies that met inclusion criteria, concentrations of peripheral blood BDNF were higher after exercise (SMD=0.59, 95% CI: 0.46-0.72, P<0.001). In meta-regression analysis, greater duration of exercise was associated with greater increases in BDNF. Subgroup analyses revealed an effect in males but not in females, and a greater BDNF increase in plasma than serum. Acute exercise increased BDNF concentrations in the peripheral blood of healthy adults. This effect was influenced by exercise duration and may be different across genders.

AB  - Although epidemiological studies have found a significant amount of toxins in surface water, a complex link between animals' access to wastewater and associated animal and human welfare losses needs to be explored. The scarcity of safe water has put stress on the utilization of wastewater for crops and livestock production. The access of animals to wastewater is related to the emergence of dangerous animal's diseases, hampering productivity, increasing economic losses, and risking human health along the food chain. This review explores use of wastewater for agriculture, epidemiological evidence of microbial contamination in wastewater, and animal and human welfare disruption due to the use of wastewater for crop and livestock production. More specifically, the review delves into animals exposure to wastewater for bathing, drinking, or grazing on a pasture irrigated with contaminated water and related animal and human welfare losses. We included some scientific articles and reviews published from 1970 to 2017 to support our rational discussions. The selected articles dealt exclusively with animals direct access to wastewater via bathing and indirect access via grazing on pasture irrigated with contaminated wastewater and their implication for animal and human welfare losses. The study also identified that some policy options such as wastewater treatments, constructing wastewater stabilization ponds, controlling animal access to wastewater, and dissemination of necessary information to ultimate consumers related to the source of agricultural produce and wastewater use in animal and crop production are required to protect the human and animal health and welfare.

AB  - Experimental psychology defines Prediction Error (PE) as a mismatch between expected and current events. It represents a unifier concept within the memory field, as it is the driving force of memory acquisition and updating. Prediction error induces updating of consolidated memories in strength or content by memory reconsolidation. This process has two different neurobiological phases, which involves the destabilization (labilization) of a consolidated memory followed by its restabilization. The aim of this work is to emphasize the functional role of PE on the neurobiology of learning and memory, integrating and discussing different research areas: behavioral, neurobiological, computational and clinical psychiatry.

AB  - Although some studies have reported potential associations of dietary patterns with depression risk, a consistent perspective hasn't been estimated to date. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the relation between dietary patterns and the risk of depression. A literature research was conducted searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2016. In total, 21 studies from ten countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present meta-analysis. A dietary pattern characterized by a high intakes of fruit, vegetables, whole grain, fish, olive oil, low-fat dairy and antioxidants and low intakes of animal foods was apparently associated with a decreased risk of depression. A dietary pattern characterized by a high consumption of red and/or processed meat, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter, potatoes and high-fat gravy, and low intakes of fruits and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of depression. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that healthy pattern may decrease the risk of depression, whereas western-style may increase the risk of depression. However, more randomized controlled trails and cohort studies are urgently required to confirm this findings.

AB  - The literature review analyzed 24 studies that explored male intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration risk factors among men, in particular Hispanics, using the socioecological model framework composed of four socioecological levels for violence prevention. Six databases were reviewed within the EBSCO search engine for articles published from 2000 to 2014. Articles reviewed were specific to risk factors for IPV perpetration among Hispanic men, focusing particularly on Mexican American men. Many key factors have previously been associated with risk for IPV perpetration; however, certain determinants are unique to Hispanics such as acculturation, acculturation stress, and delineated gender roles that include Machismo and Marianismo. These risk factors should be incorporated in future targeted prevention strategies and efforts and capitalize on the positive aspects of each to serve as protective factors.

AB  - Decreased cognitive control over the urge to be involved in gambling activities is a core feature of Gambling Disorder (GD). Cognitive control can be differentiated into several cognitive sub-processes pivotal in GD clinical phenomenology, such as response inhibition, conflict monitoring, decision-making, and cognitive flexibility. This article aims to systematically review fMRI studies, which investigated the neural mechanisms underlying diminished cognitive control in GD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and collected neuropsychological and neuroimaging data investigating cognitive control in GD. We included a total of 14 studies comprising 499 individuals. Our results indicate that impaired activity in prefrontal cortex may account for decreased cognitive control in GD, contributing to the progressive loss of control over gambling urges. Among prefrontal regions, orbital and ventromedial areas seem to be a possible nexus for sensory integration, value-based decision-making and emotional processing, thus contributing to both motivational and affective aspects of cognitive control. Finally, we discussed possible therapeutic approaches aimed at the restoration of cognitive control in GD, including pharmacological and brain stimulation treatments.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is histologically characterized by the accumulation of alpha(-)synuclein particles, known as Lewy bodies. The second most common neurodegenerative disorder, PD is widely known because of the typical motor manifestations of active tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, while several prodromal non-motor symptoms including REM sleep behavior disorders, depression, autonomic disturbances, and cognitive decline are being more extensively recognized. Motor symptoms most commonly arise from synucleinopathy of nigrostriatal pathway. Glutamatergic,gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, cholinergic, serotoninergic, and endocannabinoid neurotransmission systems are not spared from the global cerebral neurodegenerative assault. Wide intrabasal and extrabasal of the basal ganglia provide enough justification to evaluate network circuits disturbance of these neurotransmission systems in PD. In this comprehensive review, English literature in PubMed, Science direct, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were perused. Characteristics of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems, disturbance of these neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of PD, and their treatment applications are discussed.

AB  - The role of immune activation in psychiatric disorders has attracted considerable attention over the past two decades, contributing to the rise of a new era for psychiatry. Microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are progressively becoming the main focus of the research in this field. In this Review, we assess the literature on microglia activation across different psychiatric disorders, including post-mortem and in-vivo studies in humans and experimental studies in animals. Although microglia activation has been noted in all types of psychiatric disorder, no association was seen with specific diagnostic categories. Furthermore, the findings from these studies highlight that not all psychiatric patients have microglial activation. Therefore, the cause of the neuroinflammation in these cohorts and its implications are unclear. We discuss psychosocial stress as one of the main factors determining microglial activation in patients with psychiatric disorders, and explore the relevance of these findings for future treatment strategies.

AB  - Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) exhibit a broad array of physical and psychiatric features, of which impaired social cognition and poor social functioning are common. This review seeks to (1) characterize the current understanding of impairment across social cognitive domains in the context of 22q11DS, and (2) synthesize the relevant literature on social cognition and psychosis, given that the prevalence of psychosis in 22q11DS is especially high compared to the general population. A total of 16 papers examining social cognition in 22q11DS were identified through a comprehensive literature search conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and PSYCInfo. Results suggest that individuals with 22q11DS exhibit impaired emotion processing and complex theory of mind relative to their typically developing peers, though some findings were accounted for by neurocognitive and intellectual abilities. Further, no studies have examined the domains of attribution bias or social perception in 22q11DS, highlighting a critical gap in the extant literature. More research is needed to better elucidate the trajectory of how and why social cognitive impairment develops in 22q11DS, and to explore possible relationships to psychiatric comorbidities like psychosis. Treatment implications and future steps are considered.

AB  - Many of the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) can be preceded, sometimes for several years, by non-motor symptoms that include hyposmia, sleep disorders, depression and constipation. These non-motor features appear across the spectrum of patients with PD, including individuals with genetic causes of PD. The neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological bases of non-motor abnormalities in PD remain largely undefined. Here, we discuss recent advances that have helped to establish the presence, severity and effect on the quality of life of non-motor symptoms in PD, and the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological mechanisms involved. We also discuss the potential for the non-motor features to define a prodrome that may enable the early diagnosis of PD.

AB  - It has been argued that there is a "subjective present" or "experienced moment" of about 3 seconds in duration, involving automatic binding of events into perceptual units on that time scale. Research on topics that have been taken as relevant to this proposal is reviewed. The topics include accuracy in reproduction of stimulus durations, synchronization of behavior with a regular beat, mental rhythmization of a regular beat, time units in behavior, segmentation of observed behavior into meaningful units, time scale of reversals of perception with bistable ambiguous figures, time scale of inhibition of return in visual search, and EEG responses to deviant stimuli in series of repeating stimuli. Most of the research findings were not consistent with the 3 s window hypothesis. The small amount of supportive evidence is better interpreted as effects of specific processing mechanisms, not as showing general temporal integration. The evidence shows that temporal integration occurs on multiple time scales and no particular duration is special, and that windows of temporal integration are defined in terms of information density, not in terms of duration. The subjective present is constructed through local temporal integration on multiple time scales, further integrated into a coherent global representation of what is going on.

Decades of research define how APP is altered to form A beta, and how A beta generates oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. Numerous signaling pathways and changes in cell physiology are known to influence APP processing. Existing data additionally indicate a relationship exists between mitochondria, bioenergetics, and APP processing. Here, we review data that address whether mitochondrial function and bioenergetics modify APP processing and A beta production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Personality disorders are defined in the current psychiatric diagnostic system as pervasive, inflexible, and stable patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving, and interacting with others. Questions regarding the validity and reliability of the current personality disorder diagnoses prompted a reconceptualization of personality pathology in the most recent edition of the psychiatric diagnostic manual, in an appendix of emerging models for future study. To evaluate the construct and discriminant validity of the current personality disorder diagnoses, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of the existing empirical research on associations between personality disorders and interpersonal functioning, defined using the interpersonal circumplex model (comprising orthogonal dimensions of agency and communion), as well as functioning in specific relationship domains (parent-child, family, peer, romantic). A comprehensive literature search yielded 127 published and unpublished studies, comprising 2,579 effect sizes. Average effect sizes from 120 separate meta-analyses, corrected for sampling error and measurement unreliability, and aggregated using a random-effects model, indicated that each personality disorder showed a distinct profile of interpersonal style consistent with its characteristic pattern of symptomatic dysfunction; specific relationship domains affected and strength of associations varied for each personality disorder. Overall, results support the construct and discriminant validity of the personality disorders in the current diagnostic manual, as well as the proposed conceptualization that disturbances in self and interpersonal functioning constitute the core of personality pathology. Importantly, however, contradicting both the current and proposed conceptualizations, there was not evidence for pervasive dysfunction across interpersonal situations and relationships.

AB  - Background: It is suggested that people with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) may be at increased risk of suicide; however, research on this topic has been minimal and there are conflicting reports in existing studies. Aim: To bring together research investigating the prevalence, risk factors, and comorbid factors of suicidality in ASD. Method: A systematic search was performed of Medline, Psych Info, Embase, and the Web of Science following PRISMA guidelines. After exclusion criteria were applied, 70 full-text articles were screened. The final review contained 12 papers with a total sample size of 2,651. Results: Prevalence of suicide attempts varied between 7% and 47%, while suicidal ideation was reported in up to 72% of cases. Being male and having a history of self-harm and depression were cited as significant risk factors. Limitations: Papers were cross sectional and contained a number of limitations. Only one paper used the gold standard for diagnosis of ASD and one a standardized measure of suicidal behavior. Conclusion: Suicidal attempts and ideation are increased in ASD; however, the extent of the increase and the risk factors identified within this group remain under-investigated. There is a lack of research on protective factors. The correlation between ASD and suicidality needs further examination with longitudinal research.

   Aims
   To summarise available evidence and quantify the association between schizophrenia and cancer mortality using meta-analysis.
   Method
   We systematically searched literature in the PubMed and Embase databases. Risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals reported in individual studies were pooled using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.
   Results
   We included 19 studies in the meta-analysis. Among them, 15 studies reported standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing patients with schizophrenia with the general population, and the pooled SMR was 1.40 (95% Cl 1.29-1.52, P < 0.001). The other four studies reported hazard ratios (HRs) comparing individuals with schizophrenia with those without schizophrenia; the pooled HR was 1.51 (95% Cl 1.13-2.03, P = 0.006).
   Conclusions
   Patients with schizophrenia are at a significantly increased risk of cancer mortality compared with the general population or individuals without schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: In the recent decade, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have been proposed for several applications in the central nervous system (CNS), including targeting amyloid beta (A beta) in the arteries, inhibiting the microglial cells, delivering drugs, and increasing contrast in magnetic resonance imaging. Conversely, a notable number of studies have reported the role of iron in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study has reviewed the recent studies to determine whether IONPs iron can threaten the cellular viability same as iron.
   Results: Iron contributes in Fenton's reaction and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause to damage the macromolecules and organelles of the cell via oxidative stress. Iron accumulation and oxidative stress are able to aggregate some proteins, including A beta and alpha-synuclein, which play a critical role in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. Iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and protein aggregation make a positive feedback loop, which can be toxic for the cell. The release of iron ions from IONPs may result in iron accumulation in the targeted tissue, and thus, activate the positive feedback loop. However, the levels of IONPs induced toxicity depend on the size, concentration, surface charge, and the type of coating and functional groups of IONPs.
   Conclusion: IONPs depending on their properties can lead to iron accumulation, oxidative stress and protein aggregation in the neural cells. Therefore, in order to apply IONPs in the CNS, the consideration of IONPs properties is crucial.

AB  - Background: High levels of hospital readmission (rehospitalisation rates) is widely used as indicator of a poor quality of care. This is sometimes also referred to as recidivism or heavy utilization. Previous studies have examined a number of factors likely to influence readmission, although a systematic review of research on post-discharge factors and readmissions has not been conducted so far. The main objective of this review was to identify frequently reported post-discharge factors and their effects on readmission rates.
   Methods: Studies on the association between post-discharge variables and readmission after an index discharge with a main psychiatric diagnosis were searched in the bibliographic databases Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health Management, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. Relevant articles published between January 1990 and June 2014 were included. A systematic approach was used to extract and organize in categories the information about post-discharge factors associated with readmission rates.
   Results: Of the 760 articles identified by the initial search, 80 were selected for this review which included a total number of 59 different predictors of psychiatric readmission. Subsequently these were grouped into four categories: 1) individual vulnerability factors, 2) aftercare related factors, 3) community care and service responsiveness, and 4) contextual factors and social support. Individual factors were addressed in 58 papers and were found to be significant in 37 of these, aftercare factors were significant in 30 out of the 45 papers, community care and social support factors were significant in 21 out of 31 papers addressing these while contextual factors and social support were significant in all seven papers which studied them.
   Conclusions: This review represents a first attempt at providing an overview of post-discharge factors previously studied in association with readmission. Hence, by mapping out the current research in the area, it highlights the gaps in research and it provides guidance future studies in the area.

AB  - In neurons, but also in all other cells the complex proteostasis network is monitored and tightly regulated by the cellular protein quality control (PQC) system. Beyond folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and their refolding upon misfolding the PQC also manages the disposal of aberrant proteins either by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery or by the autophagic-lysosomal system. Aggregated proteins are primarily degraded by a process termed selective macroautophagy (or aggrephagy). One such recently discovered selective macroautophagy pathway is mediated by the multifunctional HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3 (BCL-2-associated athanogene 3). Under acute stress and during cellular aging, BAG3 in concert with the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSPB8 as well as the ubiquitin receptor p62/SQSTM1 specifically targets aggregation-prone proteins to autophagic degradation. Thereby, BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy represents a pivotal adaptive safeguarding and emergency system of the PQC which is activated under pathophysiological conditions to ensure cellular proteostasis. Interestingly, BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy is also involved in the clearance of aggregated proteins associated with agerelated neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease (tau-protein), Huntington's disease (mutated huntingtin/polyQ proteins), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (mutated SOD1). In addition, based on its initial description BAG3 is an anti-apoptotic protein that plays a decisive role in other widespread diseases, including cancer and myopathies. Therefore, in the search for novel therapeutic intervention avenues in neurodegeneration, myopathies and cancer BAG3 is a promising candidate.

AB  - Background: Despite poor evidence of their effectiveness, colloidal silver and silver nanoparticles are increasingly being promoted for treating potentially contaminated drinking water in low income countries. Recently, however, concerns have been raised about the possible genotoxicity of particulate silver.
   Objectives: The goal of this paper was to review the published mammalian in vivo genotoxicity studies using silver micro and nanoparticles.
   Methods: SCOPUS and Medline were searched using the following search string: ("DNA damage" OR genotox* OR Cytotox* OR Embryotox*) AND (silver OR AgNP). Included papers were any mammalian in vivo experimental studies investigating genotoxicity of silver particles. Studies were quality assessed using the ToxRTool.
   Results: 16 relevant papers were identified. There were substantial variations in study design including the size of silver particles, animal species, target organs, silver dose, route of administration and the method used to detect genotoxicity. Thus, it was not possible to produce a definitive pooled result. Nevertheless, most studies showed evidence of genotoxicity unless using very low doses. We also identified one human study reporting evidence of "severe DNA damage" in silver jewellery workers occupationally exposed to silver particles.
   Conclusions: With the available evidence it is not possible to be definitive about risks to human health from oral exposure to silver particulates. However, the balance of evidence suggests that there should be concerns especially when considering the evidence from jewellery workers. There is an urgent need to determine whether people exposed to particulate silver as part of drinking water treatment have evidence of DNA damage.

AB  - As global climate change progresses, the occurrence of potentially disruptive climatic events such as storms are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity resulting in higher mortality and reduced reproductive success. What constitutes an extreme climatic event? First we point out that extreme climatic events in biological contexts can occur in any environment. Focusing on field and laboratory data on wild birds we propose a mechanistic approach to defining and investigating what extreme climatic events are and how animals cope with them at physiological and behavioural levels. The life cycle of birds is made up of life-history stages such as migration, breeding and moult that evolved to match a range of environmental conditions an individual might expect during the year. When environmental conditions deteriorate and deviate from the expected range then the individual must trigger coping mechanisms (emergency life-history stage) that will disrupt the temporal progression of life-history stages, but enhance survival. Using the framework of allostasis, we argue that an extreme climatic event in biological contexts can be defined as when the cumulative resources available to an individual are exceeded by the sum of its energetic costs-a state called allostatic overload. This allostatic overload triggers the emergency life-history stage that temporarily allows the individual to cease regular activities in an attempt to survive extreme conditions. We propose that glucocorticoid hormones play a major role in orchestrating coping mechanisms and are critical for enduring extreme climatic events.

AB  - In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cell compartment involved in secretory protein translocation and quality control of secretory protein folding. Different conditions can alter ER function, resulting in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins within the ER lumen. Such a condition, known as ER stress, elicits an integrated adaptive response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway. Conversely, in prolonged cell stress or insufficient adaptive response, UPR signaling causes cell death. ER dysfunctions are involved and contribute to neuronal degeneration in several human diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The correlations between ER stress and its signal transduction pathway known as the UPR with neuropathological changes are well established. In addition, much evidence suggests that genetic or pharmacological modulation of UPR could represent an effective strategy for minimizing the progressive neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review recent results describing the main cellular mechanisms linking ER stress and UPR to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we provide an up-to-date panoramic view of the currently pursued strategies for ameliorating the toxic effects of protein unfolding in disease by targeting the ER UPR pathway.

AB  - Neuroscientific research has made a concerted effort to determine cortical localization using various functional imaging techniques. This approach has undoubtedly yielded important novel anatomical knowledge, albeit at times contradictory, regarding the structural organization of the vestibular cortex. Unfortunately however, this knowledge has not translated to our understanding regarding how neural mechanisms control vestibular function. Based upon recent functional imaging, lesion and neuro-physiological data that have demonstrated (i) the close behavioral and neuro-anatomical relationship between cortical processing of vestibular and spatial attention signals, and (ii) that inducing interhemispheric competition can in-turn strongly modulate vestibular function akin to that observed in cortical lesion patients, I herewith propose the hypothesis that vestibular cortical processing is controlled, as per for spatial attention, via dynamic interhemispheric competition. In the first half of this review I discuss previous key findings in the field of vestibular neuroscience that can be reinterpreted to support the role of interhemispheric competition for the control of high-level vestibular functions. Contrastingly, in the second half of this review, I present previous findings that show how disrupting interhemispheric interactions can modulate the brainstem-mediated vestibular ocular reflex (VOR). I conclude by speculating why interhemispheric competition induces correlated biases at the cortical and brainstem level respectively. Specifically, I propose that brainstem-mediated vestibulo-spatial and vestibulo-temporal transformations, in addition to coding for head displacement, underpin a generalized cortical magnitude estimation system which the CNS uses to construct dynamic spatio-temporal maps of the physical world, in-turn ensuring spatial orientation.

AB  - Saliva is an emerging biofluid with a significant number of applications in use across research and clinical settings. The present paper explores the reasons why saliva has grown in popularity in recent years, balancing both the potential strengths and weaknesses of this biofluid. Focusing on reasons why saliva is different from other common biological fluids such as blood, urine, or tears, we review how saliva is easily obtained, with minimal risk to the donor, and reduced costs for collection, transportation, and analysis. We then move on to a brief review of the history and progress in rapid salivary testing, again reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of rapid immunoassays (e.g., lateral flow immunoassay) compared to more traditional immunoassays. We consider the potential for saliva as an alternative biofluid in a setting where rapid results are important. We focus the review on salivary tests for small molecule biomarkers using cortisol as an example. Such salivary tests can be applied readily in a variety of settings and for specific measurement purposes, providing researchers and clinicians with opportunities to assess biomarkers in real time with lower transportation, collection, and analysis costs, faster turnaround time, and minimal training requirements. We conclude with a note of cautious optimism that the field will soon gain the ability to collect and analyze salivary specimens at any location and return viable results within minutes.

AB  - Conflicts and precarious living conditions resulted in the arrival of large numbers of refugees in Europe and especially in Germany. Evidence suggests that immigrant populations are at elevated risk of psychotic disorders. Considering the traumatic pre- and post-migratory adversities refugees may have encountered, people granted refugee status may even be more susceptible to psychosis than non-refugee migrants. The aim of this literature review is to summarise and interpret recent research on the incidence or prevalence of psychotic disorders in refugees, additionally focusing on the aspects of gender and Middle Eastern provenance. A systematic search in PubMed was performed in the time from 20 to 28 May 2016. Relevant literature was limited to articles describing cohort studies conducted in Western industrialised countries. Articles published between 1 June 2006 and 28 May 2016 were analysed. Content relating to psychotic disorders in refugees was reviewed and summarised. The selected studies showed an increased risk of psychotic disorders in refugees compared with both the indigenous population and non-refugee. migrants. The elevated risk was more pronounced in refugee men. A particularly high risk in refugees of Middle Eastern origin could not be inferred. The higher susceptibility to psychotic disorders in refugees emphasises the need for the development and implementation of adequate prevention strategies. Clinicians and people working in a refugee setting should be aware of early signs and symptoms of psychosis. Further research is required to evaluate post-migratory experiences and investigate the population of refugees affected by the current humanitarian crisis.

AB  - With the advent of post-genomic era, new technologies create extraordinary possibilities for diagnostics and personalized therapy, transforming todays' medicine. Rooted in both medical genetics and clinical psychiatry, the paper is designed as an integrated source of information of the current and potential future application of emerging genomic technologies as diagnostic tools in psychiatry, moving beyond the classical concept of patient approach. Selected approaches are presented, starting from currently used technologies (next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays), followed by newer options (reverse phenotyping). Next, we describe an old concept in a new light (endophenotypes), subsequently coming up with a sophisticated and complex approach (gene networks) ending by a nascent field (computational psychiatry). The challenges and barriers that exist to translate genomic research to real-world patient assessment are further discussed. We emphasize the view that only a paradigm shift can bring a fundamental change in psychiatric practice, allowing to disentangle the intricacies of mental diseases. All the diagnostic methods, as described, are directed at uncovering the integrity of the system including many types of relations within a complex structure. The integrative system approach offers new opportunity to connect genetic background with specific diseases entities, or concurrently, with symptoms regardless of a diagnosis. To advance the field, we propose concerted cross-disciplinary effort to provide a diagnostic platform operating at the general level of genetic pathogenesis of complex-trait psychiatric disorders rather than at the individual level of a specific disease.

AB  - Only one out of seven patients recovers after a first episode of psychosis despite psychiatric care. Rehabilitation interventions have been developed to improve functional outcomes and to promote recovery. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of the main psychiatric rehabilitation interventions following a search of the electronic databases Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar using combinations of terms relating to cognitive remediation, psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and schizophrenia. Eighty articles relevant to the topic of interest were found. According to results, cognitive remediation has been found to be effective in reducing the impact of cognitive impairment, social skills in the learning a variety of skills and to a lesser extent in reducing negative symptoms, psychoeducation in improving compliance and reducing relapses, and cognitive therapy in reducing the intensity of or distress related to positive symptoms. All psychosocial rehabilitation interventions should be considered as evidence-based practices for schizophrenia and need to become a major part of the standard treatment of the disease.

AB  - Online interventions for gambling, alcohol, and illegal drug related problems have been developing at a fast pace over the past decade. Yet, little is known about the content and efficacy of interventions provided entirely online for reducing drug/alcohol use and gambling, or about the characteristics of those who use these interventions. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics of online interventions, their efficacy, and the profile of their clientele. Documentation was mainly obtained through four scientific databases in psychology, technology, and medical research (PsychINFO, MedLine, Francis, and INSPEC) using three keywords (substances or gambling, intervention, Internet). Of the 4,708 documents initially identified, 18 studies meeting admissibility criteria were retained and analyzed after exclusion of duplicates and non-relevant documents. No study in the review related to problem gambling. The majority of interventions were based upon motivational or cognitive-behavioral theoretical approaches and called upon well-established therapeutic components in the field of addictions. The participants in these studies were generally adults between 30 and 46 years old with a high school education and presenting a high risk or problematic use. More than three quarters of the studies showed a short-term decrease in use that was maintained 6 months later, but only two studies included a 12 months follow-up. Online interventions seem promising and appear to meet the needs of participants who are in the workforce and seeking help for the first time. Long-term efficacy studies should nonetheless be conducted.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, the aetiology of which remains elusive. The primary clinical feature of progressively impaired motor control is caused by a loss of midbrain substantia nigra dopamine neurons that have a high alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and iron content. alpha-Syn is a neuronal protein that is highly modified post-translationally and central to the Lewy body neuropathology of the disease. This review provides an overview of findings on the role post translational modifications to alpha-syn have in membrane binding and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Furthermore, we propose a concept in which acetylation and phosphorylation of alpha-syn modulate endocytic import of iron and vesicle transport of dopamine during normal physiology. Disregulated phosphorylation and oxidation of alpha-syn mediate iron and dopamine dependent oxidative stress through impaired cellular location and increase propensity for alpha-syn aggregation. The proposition highlights a connection between alpha-syn, iron and dopamine, three pathological components associated with disease progression in sporadic Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The study of evolutionary patterns of cognitive convergence would be greatly helped by a clear demarcation of cognition. Cognition is often used as an equivalent of mind, making it difficult to pin down empirically or to apply it confidently beyond the human condition. Recent developments in embodied cognition and philosophy of biology now suggest an interpretation that dissociates cognition from this mental context. Instead, it anchors cognition in a broad range of biological cases of intelligence, provisionally marked by a basic cognitive toolkit. This conception of cognition as an empirically based phenomenon provides a suitable and greatly expanded domain for studies of evolutionary convergence. This paper first introduces this wide, biologically embodied interpretation of cognition. Second, it discusses examples drawn from studies on bacteria, plants and fungi that all provide cases fulfilling the criteria for this wide interpretation. Third, the field of early nervous system evolution is used to illustrate how biologically embodied cognition raises new fundamental questions for research on animal cognition. Finally, an outline is given of the implications for the evolutionary convergence of cognition.

AB  - The World Wide Web such as social networks, forums, review sites and blogs generate enormous heaps of data in the form of users views, emotions, opinions and arguments about different social events, products, brands, and politics. Sentiments of users that are expressed on the web has great influence on the readers, product vendors and politicians. The unstructured form of data from the social media is needed to be analyzed and well-structured and for this purpose, sentiment analysis has recognized significant attention. Sentiment analysis is referred as text organization that is used to classify the expressed mind-set or feelings in different manners such as negative, positive, favorable, unfavorable, thumbs up, thumbs down, etc. The challenge for sentiment analysis is lack of sufficient labeled data in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). And to solve this issue, the sentiment analysis and deep learning techniques have been merged because deep learning models are effective due to their automatic learning capability. This Review Paper highlights latest studies regarding the implementation of deep learning models such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks and many more for solving different problems of sentiment analysis such as sentiment classification, cross lingual problems, textual and visual analysis and product review analysis, etc.

AB  - Soft robots promise an exciting design trajectory in the field of robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI), promising more adaptive, resilient movement within environments as well as a safer, more sensitive interface for the objects or agents the robot encounters. In particular, tactile HRI is a critical dimension for designers to consider, especially given the onrush of assistive and companion robots into our society. In this article, we propose to surface an important set of ethical challenges for the field of soft robotics to meet. Tactile HRI strongly suggests that soft-bodied robots balance tactile engagement against emotional manipulation, model intimacy on the bonding with a tool not with a person, and deflect users from personally and socially destructive behavior the soft bodies and surfaces could normally entice.

AB  - Background. The appropriate monitoring of patients on lithium therapy has been the subject of extensive research in the form of clinical audits and surveys culminating in the development of specific guidelines to help clinicians provide optimal care for patients on lithium. The concept of shared care' has also gained attention in the literature with various types of shared care interventions being introduced as potential ways of improving communication between primary and secondary care.
   Objectives. This article aims to (1) review the literature evaluating lithium monitoring practices in the United Kingdom and Ireland in the last 25 years and (2) determine whether locally agreed shared care agreements have the potential to improve monitoring quality.
   Methods. A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL and PsychInfo. A total of 12 studies were selected for review including 11 audits/prospective chart reviews and one qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.
   Conclusions. Overall, the quality of lithium monitoring seems to be improving throughout the years. However, none of the studies reviewed revealed complete adherence to monitoring guidelines. This may be due to a lack of effective communication between primary and secondary care. Several shared care interventions have been described in the literature but there is a paucity of studies concerned with the effects of local shared care arrangements designed for the specific purpose of lithium monitoring. Nonetheless, the extant data suggests that such agreements may help improve monitoring standards by allowing the responsibilities for managing the prescribing and monitoring of lithium to be more clearly defined and shared between primary and secondary care.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most frequently encountered diseases in adults with progressive loss of memory and behavioral changes. Inspite of there being an intense research in the field of AD, only a few chemical entities exhibiting anti-AD activity make it through the clinical trials and it is thus need of an hour to develop new drugs or repurpose the existing ones for better management of Alzheimer's disease. Novel therapeutic targets can influence drug discovery in the field of AD. Cyclin Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5) which is a serine/threonine kinase can prove to be an upcoming beneficial target to be studied for treating AD. Cdk5 is important for development of CNS and neuron movements, however in AD pathological stimuli cause Cdk5 hyperactivation which eventually results in hyperphosphorylation of various substrates such as amyloid precursor protein, tau and many more. This review provides an insight on Cdk5 as a target for treatment of AD and discuss therapeutic candidates for targeting it.

AB  - Purpose Food addiction (FA) is a newly defined yet still controversial condition that has important etiological, developmental, treatment, prevention, and social policy implications. In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, more severe trauma histories, greater symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.
   Methods A Medline search was undertaken using the following terms: food addiction cross-referenced with eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and binge eating), obesity, trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, and comorbidity.
   Results The thesis is that the identification and acknowledgment of the concept of FA, when integrated into an overall, trauma-focused and transdiagnostic treatment approach, are supported and can be useful in understanding clinically the "big picture."
   Conclusions Food addiction (FA) may be used as a proxy for (1) bulimic eating disorder severity, (2) complex trauma histories, (3) severity of PTSD and PTSD symptoms, (4) intensity of psychiatric comorbidity, (5) severity of obesity, as well as (6) their combination. Implications for developing treatment strategies are discussed. The case for a comprehensive management that requires careful attention to medical and psychiatric assessment and integrated care that incorporates trauma-focused treatment is made.

This meta-analysis reviewed and analyzed the recent studies addressing the potential association between the Val66Met polymorphisms and panic disorder susceptibility. Related case-control studies were retrieved by database searching and selected according to established inclusion criteria. Six articles were identified, which explored the association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and panic disorder. Statistical analyses revealed no association for the allele contrast and the dominant model. However, the recessive model showed a significant association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and panic disorder (odds ratio=1.26, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.52, z=2.39, P=0.02). Despite of some limitations, this meta-analysis suggests that the Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF gene is a susceptibility factor for panic disorder.

AB  - Background The WHO Guidelines for the inpatient treatment of severely malnourished children include a recommendation to provide sensory stimulation or play therapy for children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). This systematic review was performed to synthesize evidence around this recommendation. Specifically, the objective was to answer the question: "In children with severe acute malnutrition, does psychosocial stimulation improve child developmental, nutritional, or other outcomes?"
   Methods A review protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO 2016: CRD42016036403). MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched with terms related to SAM and psychosocial stimulation. Studies were selected if they applied a stimulation intervention in children with SAM and child developmental and nutritional outcomes were assessed. Findings were presented within a narrative synthesis and a summary of findings table. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   Findings Only two studies, both non-randomized controlled trials, met the selection criteria for this review. One was conducted in Jamaica (1975) with a follow-up period of 14 years; the other was done in Bangladesh (2002) with a six-month follow-up. At the individual study level, each of the included studies demonstrated significant differences in child development outcomes between intervention and control groups. Only the study conducted in Bangladesh demonstrated a clinically significant increase in weight-for-age z-scores in the intervention group compared to the control group.
   Conclusions The evidence supporting the recommendation of psychosocial stimulation for children with SAM is not only sparse, but also of very low quality across important outcomes. High-quality trials are needed to determine the effects of psychosocial stimulation interventions on outcomes in children with SAM.

AB  - This review outlines nitrogen (N) responses in crop production and potential management decisions to ameliorate abiotic stresses for better crop production. N is a primary constituent of the nucleotides and proteins that are essential for life. Production and application of N fertilizers consume huge amounts of energy, and excess is detrimental to the environment. Therefore, increasing plant N use efficiency (NUE) is important for the development of sustainable agriculture. NUE has a key role in crop yield and can be enhanced by controlling loss of fertilizers by application of humic acid and natural polymers (hydrogels), having high water-holding capacity which can improve plant performance under field conditions. Abiotic stresses such as waterlogging, drought, heat, and salinity are the major limitations for successful crop production. Therefore, integrated management approaches such as addition of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), the film antitranspirant (di-1-p-menthene and pinolene) nutrients, hydrogels, and phytohormones may provide novel approaches to improve plant tolerance against abiotic stress-induced damage. Moreover, for plant breeders and molecular biologists, it is a challenge to develop cotton cultivars that can tolerate plant abiotic stresses while having high potential NUE for the future.

Demographic characteristics of the mental health workers and clinical characteristics of the perpetrators were collected. These data revealed that homicides occurred at a frequency of approximately 1 per year. Young women caseworkers who were unaccompanied during visits to residential treatment facilities were the most common victims. Men with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were the most common perpetrators. The most likely method of homicide was by gunshot (42.4%), but 57.6% of homicides were committed by less lethal, and possibly preventable, means. Perpetrators often had a prior history of violence, criminal charges, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, or nonadherence to medications. After their legal trial, perpetrators were more likely to be imprisoned than hospitalized. Strategies to accurately identify risk and to train acute care staff in possible prevention measures are much needed. Some policy and training recommendations are offered in conclusion.

AB  - Background: The umbrella term "Internet addiction" has been criticized for its lack of specificity given the heterogeneity of potentially problematic behaviors that can be engaged in online as well as different underlying etiological mechanisms. This has led to the naming of specific online addictions, the most notable being Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). Methods: Using the contemporary literature concerning IGD and cognate topics, issues and concerns relating to the concept of IGD are examined. Results: Internet addiction and IGD are not the same, and distinguishing between the two is conceptually meaningful. Similarly, the diagnosis of IGD as proposed in the appendix of the latest (fifth) edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) remains vague regarding whether or not games need to be engaged in online, stating that IGD typically involves specific Internet games, but can also include offline games, adding to the lack of clarity. A number of authors have voiced concerns regarding the viability of including the word "Internet" in IGD, and instead proposed to use the term "video gaming disorder" or simply "gaming disorder," suggesting addiction to video gaming can also occur offline. Conclusion: The DSM-5 has caused more confusion than clarity regarding the disorder, reflected by researchers in the field contesting a supposedly reached consensus for IGD diagnosis.

AB  - Diabetes and depression are rapidly growing chronic health conditions that have significant negative impact upon the physical, psychological, social and occupational functioning, quality of life and often leads to socio-economic burden. Presence of both these comorbid diseases results in various short term and long term complications and increases the mortality as compared to those with depression or diabetes alone.
   Objectives: Systematic review of the epidemiological data, risk factors and relationship between depression and glycaemic control among the Indian studies.
   Methods: We searched Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Google Scholar and Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ) databases to identify relevant Indian studies.
   Results: Substantial variation in the prevalence of depression in people with diabetes was found across the 41 selected studies; according to this review the range is 2% to 84% (T1DM - 2-7%; T2DM - 8%-84%). Correlates of depression in diabetic patients are advancing age, female gender, low literacy rate, burden of being from a lower socioeconomic status, rural domicile, marriage and duration of diabetes of >2 years, diabetes related complications and poor glycaemic control. Sedentary life without adequate physical activities, lack of self-care are often the factors that precipitates depression in a T2DM patient and vice versa.
   Conclusion: According to this review, among Indian population there is a significant association between depression and diabetes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic psychosocial stress is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and associated cognitive deficits. Chronic stress also primes microglia and induces inflammatory responses in the adult brain, thereby compromising synapse-supportive roles of microglia and deteriorating cognitive functions during aging. Substantial evidence demonstrates that failure of microglia to clear abnormally accumulating amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. Moreover, genome-wide association studies have linked variants in several immune genes, such as TREM2 and CD33, the expression of which in the brain is restricted to microglia, with cognitive dysfunctions in LOAD. Thus, inflammation-promoting chronic stress may create a vicious cycle of aggravated microglial dysfunction accompanied by increased A beta accumulation, collectively exacerbating neurodegeneration. Surprisingly, however, little is known about whether and how chronic stress contributes to microglia-mediated neuroinflammation that may underlie cognitive impairments in AD. This review aims to summarize the currently available clinical and preclinical data and outline potential molecular mechanisms linking stress, microglia and neurodegeneration, to foster future research in this field.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric disorder with an uncertain aetiology. Recently, special attention has been given to homocysteine (Hcy), as it has been suggested that alterations in 1-carbon metabolism might be implicated in diverse psychiatric disorders. However, there is uncertainty regarding possible alterations in peripheral Hcy levels in BD.
   Methods: This study comprises a meta-analysis comparing serum and plasma Hcy levels in persons with BD and healthy controls. We conducted a systematic search for all eligible English and non-English peer-reviewed articles.
   Results: Nine cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analyses, providing data on 1547 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that serum and plasma levels of Hcy were increased in subjects with BD in either mania or euthymia when compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size in the mania group (g = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.8-1.17, P < 0.001, n = 495) and a small effect in the euthymia group (g = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.11-0.48, P = 0.002, n = 1052).
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis provides evidence that Hcy levels are elevated in persons with BD during mania and euthymia. Peripheral Hcy could be considered as a potential biomarker in BD, both of trait (since it is increased in euthymia), and also of state (since its increase is more accentuated in mania). Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relationship between bipolar disorder and Hcy, as well as the usefulness of peripheral Hcy as both a trait and state biomarker in BD.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide is known as a major health concern worldwide. There is evidence for the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in suicide behavior. Therefore, this factor has been proposed as a biomarker for suicide behavior. Clinical studies have measured BDNF concentrations at central and peripheral levels. As a consequence, the aim of this study was to assess BDNF levels in blood plasma and serum to see whether there is a difference in concentrations in patients with suicide behavior when compared to those in controls, using a meta-analysis approach.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. The search strategy was performed using three databases: PubMed, EBSCO and ScienceDirect. The meta-analysis included a total of nine case-control studies, six measured the BDNF level in serum and three in plasma in suicide behavior.
   Results: A decrease in BDNF levels in plasma was observed (d = -0.73, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.03 pg/ml). In the case of serum concentrations, no BDNF differences were encountered between cases and controls (d = 0.09, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.13 ng/ml, p(Q) =.92).
   Conclusions: According to the results found in the present meta-analysis, the plasma BDNF level could be suggest as a potential biomarker in suicide behavior. However, since the number of studies included in the analysis is limited, a larger number is necessary to determine conclusively the role of BDNF as a biomarker in suicide behavior.

AB  - Different components of global change (e.g., climate change, land use, pollution, and introduced species) continue to alter biodiversity worldwide. As northern regions are still relatively undisturbed and will likely face clear increases in temperature in the near-future, we examined the signs of biodiversity change due to anthropogenic stressors using a systematic review of previous studies. Our aim was to map where, in which way, and owing to which stressor biodiversity in northern regions has changed. We made a systematic literature search covering the years between 2000 and 2015 to obtain a comprehensive selection of recent research. As species richness was clearly the most commonly used indicator of biodiversity, we only concentrated on this aspect of biodiversity. We compared different biological groups, regions, and ecosystems. In the majority of the cases, anthropogenic stressors had decreased species richness, or had no effects on it, while increasing or multiple effects of stressors on species richness were less common. Freshwater ecosystems were most sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, as species richness often decreased owing to these stressors. The effects of land use on richness were covered relatively widely in the selected set of articles, but the effects of other components of global change on species richness require further attention. Despite the fact that pollution was not as commonly studied stressor as land use, it was the most harmful stressor type affecting species richness. Geographically, most studies were located in boreal Canada or Fennoscandia, while no studies were executed in vast circumpolar areas where the temperature rise has been greatest and the projected climate change is likely to be fast. Overall, we could find an alarmingly small set of studies that described the effects of actual anthropogenic stressors in real-life circumstances in northern high latitudes.

AB  - Objective: The association of cesarean section (CS) with the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between CS and the risk of PPD.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases for relevant articles up to November 2016. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with fixed-effects model or random-effects model.
   Results: A total of 28 studies from 27 articles involving 532,630 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between CS and PPD risk was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.16-1.36). In subgroup analyses stratified by study design [cohort studies: (1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41); case-control studies: (1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56); cross-sectional studies: (1.44, 95% CI: 1.14-1.82)] and adjustment status of complications during pregnancy [adjusted for: (L29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.48); not-adjusted for: (1.24, 95% CI: 1.13-1.36)], the above mentioned associations remained consistent. The pooled ORs of PPD were 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92 L43) for elective cesarean section (E1CS) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.33-1.62) for emergency cesarean section (EmCS).
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that CS and EmCS increase the risk of PPD. Further evidence is needed to explore the associations between the specific types of CS and the risk of PPD.

AB  - Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies has reported a positive impact of meditation on cerebral aging. However, the underlying mechanisms for these seemingly brain-protecting effects are not well-understood. This may be due to the fact, at least partly, that systematic empirical meditation research has emerged only recently as a field of scientific scrutiny. Thus, on the one hand, critical questions remain largely unanswered; and on the other hand, outcomes of existing research require better integration to build a more comprehensive and holistic picture. In this article, we first review theories and mechanisms pertaining to normal (brain) aging, specifically focusing on telomeres, inflammation, stress regulation, and macroscopic brain anatomy. Then, we summarize existing research integrating the developing evidence suggesting that meditation exerts positive effects on (brain) aging, while carefully discussing possible mechanisms through which these effects may be mediated.

AB  - Background: The police and others in occupations where they come into close contact with people experiencing/with mental ill health, often have to manage difficult and complex situations. Training is needed to equip them to recognise and assist when someone has a mental health issue or learning/intellectual disability. We undertook a systematic review of the effectiveness of training programmes aimed at increasing knowledge, changing behaviour and/or attitudes of the trainees with regard to mental ill health, mental vulnerability, and learning disabilities.
   Methods: Databases searched from 1995 onwards included: ASSIA, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), Criminal Justice Abstracts, Embase, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index. Courses, training, or learning packages aimed at helping police officers and others who interact with the public in a similar way to deal with people with mental health problems were included. Primary outcomes were change in practice and change in outcomes for the groups of people the trainees come into contact with. Systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) were included and quality assessed. In addition non-comparative evaluations of training for police in England were included.
   Results: From 8578 search results, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria: one systematic review, 12 RCTs, three prospective non-RCTs, and three non-comparative studies. The training interventions identified included broad mental health awareness training and packages addressing a variety of specific mental health issues or conditions. Trainees included police officers, teachers and other public sector workers. Some short term positive changes in behaviour were identified for trainees, but for the people the trainees came into contact with there was little or no evidence of benefit.
   Conclusions: A variety of training programmes exist for non-mental health professionals who come into contact with people who have mental health issues. There may be some short term change in behaviour for the trainees, but longer term follow up is needed. Research evaluating training for UK police officers is needed in which a number of methodological issues need to be addressed.

AB  - Background: Genetic testing for risk of hereditary cancer can help patients to make important decisions about prevention or early detection. US and UK studies show that people from ethnic minority groups are less likely to receive genetic testing. It is important to understand various groups' awareness of genetic testing and its acceptability to avoid further disparities in health care. This review aims to identify and detail awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards genetic counselling/testing for cancer risk prediction in ethnic minority groups.
   Methods: A search was carried out in PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase and MEDLINE. Search terms referred to ethnicity, genetic testing/counselling, cancer, awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions. Quantitative and qualitative studies, written in English, and published between 2000 and 2015, were included.
   Results: Forty-one studies were selected for review: 39 from the US, and two from Australia. Results revealed low awareness and knowledge of genetic counselling/testing for cancer susceptibility amongst ethnic minority groups including African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics. Attitudes towards genetic testing were generally positive; perceived benefits included positive implications for personal health and being able to inform family. However, negative attitudes were also evident, particularly the anticipated emotional impact of test results, and concerns about confidentiality, stigma, and discrimination. Chinese Australian groups were less studied, but of interest was a finding from qualitative research indicating that different views of who close family members are could impact on reported family history of cancer, which could in turn impact a risk assessment.
   Conclusion: Interventions are needed to increase awareness and knowledge of genetic testing for cancer risk and to reduce the perceived stigma and taboo surrounding the topic of cancer in ethnic minority groups. More detailed research is needed in countries other than the US and across a broader spectrum of ethnic minority groups to develop effective culturally sensitive approaches for cancer prevention.

AB  - Persistent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is thought to drive the pathology of many chronic disorders due to its potential to elicit aberrant inflammatory signaling and facilitate cell death. In neurodegenerative diseases, the accumulation of misfolded proteins and concomitant induction of ER stress in neurons contributes to neuronal dysfunction. In addition, ER stress responses induced in the surrounding neuroglia may promote disease progression by coordinating damaging inflammatory responses, which help fuel a neurotoxic milieu. Nevertheless, there still remains a gap in knowledge regarding the cell-specific mechanisms by which ER stress mediates neuroinflammation. In this review, we will discuss recently uncovered inflammatory pathways linked to the ER stress response. Moreover, we will summarize the present literature delineating how ER stress is generated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Multiple Sclerosis, and highlight how ER stress and neuroinflammation intersect mechanistically within the central nervous system. The mechanisms by which stress-induced inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood. Further examination of this interplay could present unappreciated insights into the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and reveal new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Computer-assisted tracking of the shapes of many cells over long periods of development has driven the exploration of novel ways to quantify the contributions of different cell behaviours to morphogenesis. A handful of similar methods have now been published that are used to calculate tissue deformations (strain rates) in epithelia. These methods are further used to quantify strain rates attributable to each of the cell behaviours in the tissue, such as cell shape change, cell rearrangement and cell division, that together sum to the tissue strain rates. In this review, aimed at developmental biologists, I will introduce the general approach, characterize differences in current approaches and highlight extensions of these methods that remain to be fully explored. The methods will make a major contribution to the emerging field of tissue mechanics. Precisely quantified strain rates are an essential first step towards exploring constitutive equations relating stress to strain via tissue mechanical properties.

AB  - The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the human brain is one of the critical features of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Assembles of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide-either soluble (oligomers) or insoluble (plaques) and of tau protein, which form neurofibrillary tangles, are the major hallmarks of AD. Chaperones and co-chaperones regulate protein folding and client maturation, but they also target misfolded or aggregated proteins for refolding or for degradation, mostly by the proteasome. They form an important line of defense against misfolded proteins and are part of the cellular quality control system. The heat shock protein (Hsp) family, particularly Hsp70 and Hsp90, plays a major part in this process and it is well-known to regulate protein misfolding in a variety of diseases, including tau levels and toxicity in AD. However, the role of Hsp90 in regulating protein misfolding is not yet fully understood. For example, knockdown of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of A beta misfolding leads to increased toxicity. On the other hand, the use of Hsp90 inhibitors in AD mouse models reduces A beta toxicity, and normalizes synaptic function. Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1), an intracellular co-chaperone, mediates the transfer of clients from Hsp70 to Hsp90. Importantly, STI1 has been shown to regulate aggregation of amyloid-like proteins in yeast. In addition to its intracellular function, STI1 can be secreted by diverse cell types, including astrocytes and microglia and function as a neurotrophic ligand by triggering signaling via the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Extracellular STI1 can prevent A beta toxic signaling by (i) interfering with A beta binding to PrPC and (ii) triggering pro-survival signaling cascades. Interestingly, decreased levels of STI1 in C. elegans can also increase toxicity in an amyloid model. In this review, we will discuss the role of intracellular and extracellular STI1 and the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone network in mechanisms underlying protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases, with particular focus on AD.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are prominent features of the ultra-high risk state for psychosis that are known to impact functioning and course of illness. Cognitive remediation appears to be the most promising treatment approach to alleviate the cognitive deficits, which may translate into functional improvements. This study systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive remediation in the ultra-high risk population. The electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched using keywords related to cognitive remediation and the UHR state. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed, written in English, and included a population meeting standardized ultra-high risk criteria. Six original research articles were identified. All the studies provided computerized, bottom-up-based cognitive remediation, predominantly targeting neurocognitive function. Four out of five studies that reported a cognitive outcome found cognitive remediation to improve cognition in the domains of verbal memory, attention, and processing speed. Two out of four studies that reported on functional outcome found cognitive remediation to improve the functional outcome in the domains of social functioning and social adjustment. Zero out of the five studies that reported such an outcome found cognitive remediation to affect the magnitude of clinical symptoms. Research on the effect of cognitive remediation in the ultra-high risk state is still scarce. The current state of evidence indicates an effect of cognitive remediation on cognition and functioning in ultra-high risk individuals. More research on cognitive remediation in ultra-high risk is needed, notably in large-scale trials assessing the effect of neurocognitive and/or social cognitive remediation on multiple outcomes.

AB  - Objective Identifying the life course health effects of childhood adversity is a burgeoning area of research, particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, adversity measurement varies widely across studies, which may hamper our ability to make comparisons across studies and identify mechanisms linking adversity to CVD. The purposes of this review are to summarize adversity measurement approaches in the context of CVD, identify gaps, and make recommendations for future research.
   Methods PubMed and PsycINFO searches were conducted through June 2016. Studies were selected if CVD end point or predisease risk markers were investigated in association with a measure of childhood adversity. Forty-three studies were reviewed. A meta-analysis was not conducted because of the variation in exposures and outcomes assessed.
   Results Adversity measurement was heterogeneous across studies. Metrics included different sets of adverse events, relational factors, and socioeconomic indicators. Thirty-seven percent measured childhood adversity prospectively, 23% examined a CVD end point, and 77% treated adversity as an unweighted summary score. Despite the heterogeneity in measurement, most studies found a positive association between childhood adversity and CVD risk, and the association seems to be dose-response.
   Conclusions The literature on childhood adversity and CVD would benefit from improving consistency of measurement, using weighted adversity composites, modeling adversity trajectories over time, and considering socioeconomic status as an antecedent factor instead of a component part of an adversity score. We suggest conceptual and analytic strategies to enhance, refine, and replicate the observed association between childhood adversity and CVD risk.

AB  - Background: Participants in Outdoor Education Programmes (OEPs) presumably benefit from these programmes in terms of their social and personal development, academic achievement and physical activity (PA). The aim of this systematic review was to identify studies about regular compulsory school-and curriculum-based OEPs, to categorise and evaluate reported outcomes, to assess the methodological quality, and to discuss possible benefits for students. Methods: We searched online databases to identify English-and German-language peer-reviewed journal articles that reported any outcomes on a student level. Two independent reviewers screened studies identified for eligibility and assessed the methodological quality. Results: Thirteen studies were included for analysis. Most studies used a case-study design, the average number of participants was moderate (mean valued (M) = 62.17; standard deviation (SD) = 64.12), and the methodological quality was moderate on average for qualitative studies (M = 0.52; SD = 0.11), and low on average for quantitative studies (M = 0.18; SD = 0.42). Eight studies described outcomes in terms of social dimensions, seven studies in learning dimensions and four studies were subsumed under additional outcomes, i. e., PA and health. Eleven studies reported positive, one study positive as well as negative, and one study reported negative effects. PA and mental health as outcomes were underrepresented. Conclusion: Tendencies were detected that regular compulsory school-and curriculum-based OEPs can promote students in respect of social, academic, physical and psychological dimensions. Very little is known concerning students' PA or mental health. We recommend conducting more quasi-experimental design and longitudinal studies with a greater number of participants, and a high methodological quality to further investigate these tendencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are chronic illnesses that commonly present with symptoms of acute agitation and aggression. These symptoms must be managed rapidly to prevent potential harm to the patient and others, including their caregivers, peers, and health care workers. A number of treatment options are available to clinicians to manage acute agitation and aggression, including non-pharmacologic behavioral and environmental de-escalation strategies, as well as biological treatment options such as pharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy. We summarize the available biological treatment options for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation or aggression in the inpatient setting, focusing on antipsychotics.
   METHODS: The following searches were used in PubMed to obtain the most relevant advances in treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with acute agitation and aggression: (agitation, agitated, aggression, aggressive, hostile, hostility, violent, or violence) and (schizophr*, psychosis, psychot*, psychos*, mania, manic, or bipolar) and (*pharmacologic, antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, antiepileptic*, anti-seizure*, mood stabilizer*, lithium, benzodiazepine*, beta blocker, beta-blocker, alpha2, alpha-2, *histamine*, electroconvulsive, ECT, shock, or transcranial). Individual searches were performed for each drug class. The studies were limited to peer-reviewed, English-language, and human studies. Most were placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses.
   RESULTS: Among pharmacologic agents, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and lithium have been studied in randomized trials. Some typical and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics are available as both oral and short-acting intramuscular (IM) formulations, with 1 typical antipsychotic also available as an inhalable formulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among the pharmacologic agents studied in RCTs, atypical antipsychotics have the best evidence to support efficacy both in oral and short-acting IM formulations, as well as in one instance in an inhalable formulation.

AB  - The goal congruity perspective provides a theoretical framework to understand how motivational processes influence and are influenced by social roles. In particular, we invoke this framework to understand communal goal processes as proximal motivators of decisions to engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). STEM fields are not perceived as affording communal opportunities to work with or help others, and understanding these perceived goal affordances can inform knowledge about differences between (a) STEM and other career pathways and (b) women's and men's choices. We review the patterning of gender disparities in STEM that leads to a focus on communal goal congruity (Part I), provide evidence for the foundational logic of the perspective (Part II), and explore the implications for research and policy (Part III). Understanding and transmitting the opportunities for communal goal pursuit within STEM can reap widespread benefits for broadening and deepening participation.

AB  - Infant sleep problems have been the focus of a growing literature over the last few years. The current review is based on literature searches of Pubmed and Psyclnfo for studies published over the last few years including randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on infant sleep problems and resulting developmental effected, risk factors and interventions. Several risk/protective factors for sleep problems have been identified including health literacy, TV in the room, feeding, close contact and arousing activities at bedtime, intolerance for infant crying, co-sleeping, maternal depression and infant temperament. Cross-cultural differences have been noted both for infant sleep problems and parents' perceived distress by those problems. A number of interventions have been tried to ameliorate infant sleep problems including consultations, teaching sessions on extinction and bedtime fading, internet-based interventions and nighttime massages by parents. Some of these studies have shown improvements and others have suggested only short-term or negligible effects. Significant methodological problems exist with this literature including the almost sole use of parent report as well as the mixed age samples and the potential confounding variables.

AB  - During the last 30 years the study of social movements has changed dramatically, under the recognition of how important cultural meanings are to collective action and outcomes. Social movement studies has rediscovered a number of microlevel cultural mechanisms that have enriched our understanding of protest and social movements, bringing some subjective elements to a field that for a generation had been highly structural. These include the collective identities of political players, the dynamics of gender, the role of emotions, strategic choices, and the influence of leaders. In much of this work, sociologists and political scientists in social movement studies have worked in parallel to social psychologists, and there has been insufficient dialogue between the two traditions.

AB  - Background: Psycho-oncology in Korea was introduced among the circle of consultation- liaison psychiatrists, in the 1990s. For almost 25 years, the field has been developing at a steady pace as the psychosocial needs of patients with cancer continue to increase. In this study, we review the history of psycho-oncology in Korea, in a chronological order, within the domains of clinical practice, research activity, training, and public policy.
   Main body: Before the 1990s, patients with cancer with psychiatric comorbidities were usually taken care of by consultation- liaison psychiatrists in general hospitals. In 1993, psycho-oncology was first introduced by psychiatrists. Psychologists, nurses, and social workers have also been increasingly involved in providing psychosocial care for patients with cancer. Professionals from various disciplines began to communicate, and agreed to found the Korean Psycho-Oncology Study Group ( KPOSG) in 2006, the first academic society in this field. In 2009, National Cancer Center published the " Recommendations for Distress Management in Patients with Cancer", which are consensus- based guidelines for Korean patients. In 2014, the KPOSG was dissolved and absorbed into a new organization, the Korean Psycho-Oncology Society (KPOS). It functions as a center of development of psycho-oncology, publishing official journals, and hosting annual conferences. There are many challenges, including, low awareness of psycho- oncology, presence of undertreated psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer, shortage of well-trained psycho- oncologists, stigma, and suicide risk. It is important to improve the cancer care system to the extent that psycho- oncology is integrated with mainstream oncology. Considering the socio-cultural characteristics of Korean cancer care, a Korean model of distress management is being prepared by the KPOS.
   Conclusion: This article provides an overview of the development, current issues, and future challenges of psychooncology in Korea. Through its long journey to overcome the many barriers and stigmas of cancer and mental illnesses, psycho- oncology is now acknowledged as an essential part of integrated supportive care in cancer. Active research and international cooperation can gradually shape the Korean model of distress management.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a serious cerebrovascular disease that leads to death and/or severe disability, and extensive research has been directed in search of appropriate treatment measures. One such potential treatment is the use of cerebral ischemic post-conditioning (IPostC), and its neuroprotective effects and controllability have been widely confirmed and validated. Numerous studies have indicated that cerebral IPostC can suppress the inflammatory reaction in ischemia reperfusion injury, improve cerebral circulation, reduce infarct volume, and promote both neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The neuroprotective mechanisms underlying IPostC have been systematically studied, but still need a comprehensive summary and a more exhaustive understanding. Continuing research has proposed further applications of IPostC, including remote ischemic post-conditioning, pharmacologic ischemic post-conditioning, and delayed ischemic post-conditioning. However, most studies of IPostC are performed on animal models, and clinical studies are scarce. Therefore, future studies will need to focus on increasing our understanding of neuroprotective mechanisms underlying cerebral IPostC as well as accelerating its clinical translation.

AB  - Background
   Negative symptoms observed in patients with psychotic disorders undermine quality of life and functioning. Antipsychotic medications have a limited impact. Psychological and psychosocial interventions, with medication, are recommended. However, evidence for the effectiveness of specific non-biological interventions warrants detailed examination.
   Aims
   To conduct a meta-analytic and systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of non-biological treatments for negative symptoms in psychotic disorders.
   Method
   We searched for randomised controlled studies of psychological and psychosocial interventions in psychotic disorders that reported outcome on negative symptoms. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) in values of negative symptoms at the end of treatment were calculated across study domains as the main outcome measure.
   Results
   A total of 95 studies met our criteria and 72 had complete quantitative data. Compared with treatment as usual cognitive-behavioural therapy (pooled SMD 70.34, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.12), skills-based training (pooled SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.10), exercise (pooled SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.01), and music treatments (pooled SMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.33) provide significant benefit. Integrated treatment models are effective for early psychosis (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.22) as long as the patients remain in treatment. Overall quality of evidence was moderate with a high level of heterogeneity.
   Conclusions
   Specific psychological and psychosocial interventions have utility in ameliorating negative symptoms in psychosis and should be included in the treatment of negative symptoms. However, more effective treatments for negative symptoms need to be developed.

AB  - Empathy is a phenomenon often considered dependent on higher-order emotional control and an ability to relate to the emotional state of others. It is, by many, attributed only to species having well-developed cortical circuits capable of performing such complex tasks. However, over the years, a wealth of data has been accumulated showing that rodents are capable not only of sharing emotional states of their conspecifics, but also of prosocial behavior driven by such shared experiences. The study of rodent empathic behaviors is only now becoming an independent research field. Relevant animal models allow precise manipulation of neural networks, thereby offering insight into the foundations of empathy in the mammalian brains. Here we review the data on empathic behaviors in rat and mouse models, their neurobiological and neurophysiological correlates, and the factors influencing these behaviors. We discuss how simple rodent models of empathy enhance our understanding of how brain controls empathic behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current consensus divides primate cortical visual processing into two broad networks or "streams" composed of highly interconnected areas (Milner and Goodale 2006, 2008; Goodale 2014). The ventral stream, passing from primary visual cortex (V1) through to inferior parts of the temporal lobe, is considered to mediate the transformation of the contents of the visual signal into the mental furniture that guides memory, recognition and conscious perception. In contrast the dorsal stream, passing from V1 through to various areas in the posterior parietal lobe, is generally considered to mediate the visual guidance of action, primarily in real time. The brain, however, does not work through mutually insulated subsystems, and indeed there are well-documented interconnections between the two streams. Evidence for contributions from ventral stream systems to the dorsal stream comes from human neuropsychological and neuroimaging research, and indicates a crucial role in mediating complex and flexible visuomotor skills. Complementary evidence points to a role for posterior dorsal-stream visual analysis in certain aspects of 3-D perceptual function in the ventral stream. A series of studies of a patient with visual form agnosia has been instrumental in shaping our knowledge of what each stream can achieve in isolation; but it has also helped us to tease apart the relative dependence of parietal visuomotor systems on direct bottom-up visual inputs versus inputs redirected via perceptual systems within the ventral stream.

AB  - To conduct a meta-analysis to synthesize the available research on the family of studies belonging to the Cool Kids Program, a cognitive-behavioral intervention for anxiety disorders in youth, and evaluate its overall effectiveness in addressing anxious symptomatology. A search of online databases, combined with reference list examination and communication with program implementers/developers, led to the identification of (16) studies that explored the effects of the Cool Kids Program (N = 1579), or its forerunners or extensions. Analyses focused on child-and parent-report of anxiety, with effect sizes aggregated according to a random effects model and calculated as differences between intervention and control groups at posttreatment (standardized mean difference [SMD]) as well as by considering the changes in scores between time points (e.g., standardized mean gain [SMG]). Analyses indicate superior improvement for youth receiving the Cool Kids intervention as compared with controls according to SMD analyses for both child-and parent-report, as well as for SMG analyses according to parent-report, though not according to child self-report despite a nearly identical aggregated effect size; the latter was attributable to greater gains reported by youth in control conditions; secondary analyses also suggest significantly greater improvements in automatic thoughts for Cool Kids participants. This intervention has been implemented in different modalities, holds considerable promise, and in the contemporary context of evidence-based practice, should be considered a program with strong empirical support.

AB  - Psychosis is a debilitating mental health condition affecting approximately 4 persons per 1000. Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has been shown to be an effective treatment for psychosis and is recommended by several national guidelines. CBTp does not work equally well with everyone, however, with some 50% of clients receiving little benefit. This review sets out to systematically assess the literature and methodological quality of a number of studies, which examine factors predicting successful outcome in CBTp. The databases CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCO, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus were electronically searched. English language articles in peer reviewed journals were reviewed. Search terms "psychosis", "psychotic disorder", "cognitive behavioural therapy", "cognitive therapy", "randomised controlled trial", "predictor", and "treatment outcome" in various combinations were used as needed. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Results suggest that female gender, older age, and higher clinical insight at baseline, each predicted better outcome in CBT interventions with psychotic patients, as did a shorter duration of the illness, and higher educational attainment. Several other factors, such as higher symptom severity at baseline, were suggestive of predictive capacity but further research to clarify was indicated. Providers of mental healthcare should consider these findings when offering CBTp. The onus is also on healthcare providers to better equip non-responders to CBTp. Further investigation into a limited number of predictive factors, with an agreed set of outcome measures, would allow future researchers more direct comparisons between studies.

AB  - Purpose of review
   So far, only little more than one-third of individuals classified as being at-risk for psychosis have been shown to actually convert to frank psychosis during follow-up. There have therefore been enormous efforts to improve the accuracy of predicting this transition. We reviewed the most recent studies in the field with the aim to clarify whether accuracy of prediction has been improved by the different research endeavors and what could be done to further improve it, and/or what alternative goals research should pursue.
   Recent findings
   A total of 56 studies published between May 2015 and December 2016 were included, of which eight were meta-analyses. New meta-analytical evidence confirms that established instruments for checking clinical risk criteria have an excellent clinical utility in individuals referred to high-risk services. Within a such identified group of ultra-high-risk (UHR) individuals, especially Brief Limited Intermittent Psychotic Symptoms and Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms seem to predict transition. Further assessments should be performed within the UHR individuals, as risk of transition seems particularly high in those with an even higher severity of certain symptoms such as suspiciousness or anhedonia, in those with lower global or social functioning, poor neurocognitive performance or cannabis abuse. Also, electroencephalography, neuroimaging and blood biomarkers might contribute to improving individual prediction. The most promising approach certainly is a staged multidomain assessment. Risk calculators to integrate all data for an individualized prediction are being developed.
   Summary
   Prediction of psychosis is already possible with an excellent prognostic performance based on clinical assessments. Recent studies show that this accuracy can be further improved by using multidomain approaches and modern statistics for individualized prediction. The challenge now is the translation into the clinic with a broad clinical implementation.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common health problem. There is tremendous variability and heterogeneity in human mTBI, including mechanisms of injury, biomechanical forces, injury severity, spatial and temporal pathophysiology, genetic factors, pre-injury vulnerability and resilience factors, and clinical outcomes. Animal models greatly reduce this variability and heterogeneity, and provide a means to study mTBI in a rigorous, controlled, and efficient manner. Rodent models, in particular, are time-and cost-efficient, and they allow researchers to measure morphological, cellular, molecular, and behavioral variables in a single study. However, inter-species differences in anatomy, morphology, metabolism, neurobiology, and lifespan create translational challenges. Although the term "mild" TBI is used often in the pre-clinical literature, clearly defined criteria for mild, moderate, and severe TBI in animal models have not been agreed upon. In this review, we introduce current issues facing the mTBI field, summarize the available research methodologies and previous studies in mTBI animal models, and discuss how a translational research approach may be useful in advancing our understanding and management of mTBI.

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery is an effective means of weight reduction in severely obese patients and correlates with improvements in quality of life, mental health outcomes, and neurocognition, especially in those with high psychosocial burden. Objective: The primary purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on long-term neurocognitive functioning and neuropsychological outcomes. Methods: OVID Medline and PsychInfo databases from January 1990 to August 2015 were searched with key terms and phrases: "bariatric surgery" and "cognition." The inclusion criteria for the studies included the following: n >= 10, minimum postoperative follow-up of 12 months, and use of formal neurocognitive assessment tools presurgery and postsurgery. Results: Of 422 identified abstracts, a total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria and sample sizes ranged from 10-156. Postsurgical follow-up time ranged from 12-36 months. All 10 studies documented significant improvements of statistical significance (p < 0.05) in at least 1 neurocognitive domain following bariatric surgery; 9 studies showed improvements in memory, 4 studies showed improvement in executive function, and 2 studies showed improvements in language, and 1 study showed no improvement in any neurocognitive domain. Conclusion: Mental health care providers should consider the effect of neurocognitive performance on presurgery psychiatric assessments for bariatric surgery and implications for psychosocial functioning postsurgery. The aforementioned effect that bariatric surgical intervention has on neurocognition underscores the complex interrelationship between metabolism and brain function. Future research should validate the use of neurocognitive screening tools presurgery and evaluate the impact of neurocognitive changes on neurocognitive, bariatric, and functional outcomes.

Both current research and re-analysis of past research indicates that the malingering prevalence rate at issue is more like 15 +/- 15% as opposed to 40 +/- 10%. As for psychological tests used to assess PTSD, some of the better ones include the TSI-2 (Trauma Symptom Inventory, Second Edition; Briere, 2011), the MMPI-2-RF (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition, Restructured Form; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008/2011), and the CAPS-5 (The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5; Weathers, Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & Keane, 2013b). Assessors need to know their own possible biases, the applicable laws (e.g., the Daubert trilogy), and how to write court-admissible reports. Overall conclusions reflect a moderate approach that navigates the territory between the extreme plaintiff or defense allegiances one frequently encounters in this area of forensic practice.

AB  - Corticostriatal circuits through the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play key roles in complex human behaviors such as evaluation, affect regulation and reward-based decision-making. Importantly, the medial and lateral OFC (mOFC and lOFC) circuits have functionally and anatomically distinct connectivity profiles which differentially contribute to the various aspects of goal-directed behavior. OFC corticostriatal circuits have been consistently implicated across a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and substance use disorders (SUDs). Furthermore, psychiatric disorders related to OFC corticostriatal dysfunction can be addressed via conventional and novel neurostimulatory techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such techniques elicit changes in OFC corticostriatal activity, resulting in changes in clinical symptomatology. Here we review the available literature regarding how disturbances in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal functioning may lead to psychiatric symptomatology in the aforementioned disorders, and how psychiatric treatments may exert their therapeutic effect by rectifying abnormal OFC corticostriatal activity. First, we review the role of OFC corticostriatal circuits in reward-guided learning, decision-making, affect regulation and reappraisal. Second, we discuss the role of OFC corticostriatal circuit dysfunction across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Third, we review available evidence that the therapeutic mechanisms of various neuromodulation techniques may directly involve rectifying abnormal activity in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal circuits. Finally, we examine the potential of future applications of therapeutic brain stimulation targeted at OFC circuitry; specifically, the role of OFC brain stimulation in the growing field of individually-tailored therapies and personalized medicine in psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Children and young people constitute a core target group for health literacy research and practice: during childhood and youth, fundamental cognitive, physical and emotional development processes take place and health-related behaviours and skills develop. However, there is limited knowledge and academic consensus regarding the abilities and knowledge a child or young person should possess for making sound health decisions. The research presented in this review addresses this gap by providing an overview and synthesis of current understandings of health literacy in childhood and youth. Furthermore, the authors aim to understand to what extent available models capture the unique needs and characteristics of children and young people.
   Method: Six databases were systematically searched with relevant search terms in English and German. Of the n = 1492 publications identified, N = 1021 entered the abstract screening and N = 340 full-texts were screened for eligibility. A total of 30 articles, which defined or conceptualized generic health literacy for a target population of 18 years or younger, were selected for a four-step inductive content analysis.
   Results: The systematic review of the literature identified 12 definitions and 21 models that have been specifically developed for children and young people. In the literature, health literacy in children and young people is described as comprising variable sets of key dimensions, each appearing as a cluster of related abilities, skills, commitments, and knowledge that enable a person to approach health information competently and effectively and to derive at health-promoting decisions and actions.
   Discussion: Identified definitions and models are very heterogeneous, depicting health literacy as multidimensional, complex construct. Moreover, health literacy is conceptualized as an action competence, with a strong focus on personal attributes, while also recognising its interrelatedness with social and contextual determinants. Life phase specificities are mainly considered from a cognitive and developmental perspective, leaving children's and young people's specific needs, vulnerabilities, and social structures poorly incorporated within most models. While a critical number of definitions and models were identified for youth or secondary school students, similar findings are lacking for children under the age of ten or within a primary school context.

AB  - While smartphones and related mobile technologies are recognized as flexible and powerful tools that, when used prudently, can augment human cognition, there is also a growing perception that habitual involvement with these devices may have a negative and lasting impact on users' ability to think, remember, pay attention, and regulate emotion. The present review considers an intensifying, though still limited, area of research exploring the potential cognitive impacts of smartphone-related habits, and seeks to determine in which domains of functioning there is accruing evidence of a significant relationship between smartphone technology and cognitive performance, and in which domains the scientific literature is not yet mature enough to endorse any firm conclusions. We focus our review primarily on three facets of cognition that are clearly implicated in public discourse regarding the impacts of mobile technology - attention, memory, and delay of gratification - and then consider evidence regarding the broader relationships between smartphone habits and everyday cognitive functioning. Along the way, we highlight compelling findings, discuss limitations with respect to empirical methodology and interpretation, and offer suggestions for how the field might progress toward a more coherent and robust area of scientific inquiry.

AB  - Upon increasing levels of threat, animals activate qualitatively different defensive modes, including freezing and active fight-or-flight reactions. Whereas freezing is a form of behavioural inhibition accompanied by parasympathetically dominated heart rate deceleration, fight-or-flight reactions are associated with sympathetically driven heart rate acceleration. Despite the potential relevance of freezing for human stress-coping, its phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings remain largely unexplored in humans. Studies in rodents have shown that freezing depends on amygdala projections to the brainstem (periaqueductal grey). Recent neuroimaging studies in humans have indicated that similar brain regions may be involved in human freezing. In addition, flexibly shifting between freezing and active defensive modes is critical for adequate stress-coping and relies on fronto-amygdala connections. This review paper presents a model detailing these neural mechanisms involved in freezing and the shift to fight-or-flight action. Freezing is not a passive state but rather a parasympathetic brake on the motor system, relevant to perception and action preparation. Study of these defensive responses in humans may advance insights into human stress-related psychopathologies characterized by rigidity in behavioural stress reactions. The paper therefore concludes with a research agenda to stimulate translational animal-human research in this emerging field of human defensive stress responses.

AB  - While ocean acidification (OA) effects on marine organisms are well documented, impacts of sediment acidification on infaunal organisms are relatively understudied. Here we synthesize CO2-driven sediment acidification effects on infaunal marine bivalves. While sediment carbonate system conditions can already exceed near-future OA projections, sediments can become even more acidic as overlying seawater pH decreases. Evidence suggests that infaunal bivalves experience shell dissolution, more lesions, and increased mortality in more acidic sediments; effects on heavy metal accumulation appear complex and uncertain. Infaunal bivalves can avoid negative functional consequences of sediment acidification by reducing burrowing and increasing dispersal in more acidic sediments, irrespective of species or life stage; elevated temperature may compromise this avoidance behaviour. The combined effects of sediment acidification and other environmental stressors are virtually unknown. While it is evident that sediment acidification can impact infaunal marine bivalves, more research is needed to confidently predict effects under future ocean conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The documentation of psychopathology is core to the clinical practice of the psychiatrist and clinical psychologist. However, both in initial as well as further training and specialization in their fields, this particular aspect of their work receives scanty attention only. Yet, for the past 50 years, the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) System has been in existence and available as a tool to serve precisely the purpose of offering a systematic introduction to the terminology and documentation of psychopathology. The motivation for its development was based on the need for an assessment procedure for the reliable documentation of the effectiveness of newly developed psychopharmacological substances. Subsequently, the AMDP-System began to be applied in the context of investigations into a number of methodological issues in psychiatry (e.g., the frequency and specificity of particular symptoms, the comparison of rating scales). The System then became increasingly important also in clinical practice and, today, represents the most used instrument for the documentation of psychopathology in the German-speaking countries of Europe. This paper intends to offer an overview of the AMDP-System, its origins, design, and functionality. After an initial account of the history and development of the AMDP-System, the discussion will in turn focus on the System's underlying methodological principles, the transfer of clinical skills and competencies in its practical application, and its use in research and clinical practice. Finally, potential future areas of development in relation to the AMDP-System are explored.

AB  - The balance of oxidants and antioxidants within the cell is crucial for maintaining health, and regulating physiological processes such as signalling. Consequently, imbalances between oxidants and antioxidants are now understood to lead to oxidative stress, a physiological feature that underlies many diseases. These processes have spurred the field of chemical biology to develop a plethora of sensors, both small-molecule and fluorescent protein-based, for the detection of specific oxidizing species and general redox balances within cells. The mitochondrion, in particular, is the site of many vital redox reactions. There is therefore a need to target redox sensors to this particular organelle. It has been well established that targeting mitochondria can be achieved by the use of a lipophilic cation-targeting group, or by utilizing natural peptidic mitochondrial localization sequences. Here, we review how these two approaches have been used by a number of researchers to develop mitochondrially localized fluorescent redox sensors that are already proving useful in providing insights into the roles of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria.

AB  - The unique biology of RNA binding proteins is altering our view of the genesis of protein misfolding diseases. These proteins use aggregation of low complexity domains (LCDs) as a means to regulate the localization and utilization of RNA by forming RNA granules, such as stress granules, transport granules and P-bodies. The reliance on reversible aggregation as a mechanism for biological regulation renders this family of proteins highly vulnerable to promoting diseases of protein misfolding. Mutations in RNA binding proteins are associated with many neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD). The biology of RNA binding proteins also extends to microtubule associated protein tau. Tau is normally an axonal protein, but in stress it translocates to the somatodendritic arbor where it takes on a new function promoting formation of stress granules. The interaction of tau with stress granules also promotes tau aggregation, accelerating formation of the tau pathology that we associate with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

AB  - Metallothioneins (MTs) are proteins that function by metal exchange to regulate the bioavailability of metals, such as zinc and copper. Copper functions in the brain to regulate mitochondria, neurotransmitter production, and cell signaling. Inappropriate copper binding can result in loss of protein function and Cu(I)/(II) redox cycling can generate reactive oxygen species. Copper accumulates in the brain with aging and has been shown to bind alpha-synuclein and initiate its aggregation, the primary aetiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD), and other alpha-synucleinopathies. In PD, total tissue copper is decreased, including neuromelanin-bound copper and there is a reduction in copper transporter CTR-1. Conversely cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) copper is increased. MT-1/2 expression is increased in activated astrocytes in alpha-synucleinopathies, yet expression of the neuronal MT-3 isoform may be reduced. MTs have been implicated in inflammatory states to perform one-way exchange of copper, releasing free zinc and recent studies have found copper bound to alpha-synuclein is transferred to the MT-3 isoform in vitro and MT-3 is found bound to pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates in the alpha-synucleinopathy, multiple systems atrophy. Moreover, both MT and alpha-synuclein can be released and taken up by neural cells via specific receptors and so may interact both intra- and extra-cellularly. Here, we critically review the role of MTs in copper dyshomeostasis and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Since Emil Kraepelin's conceptualization of endogenous psychoses as dementia praecox and manic depression, the separation between primary psychotic disorders and primary affective disorders has been much debated. We conducted a systematic review of case-control studies contrasting magnetic resonance imaging studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A literature search in PubMed of studies published between January 2005 and December 2016 was conducted, and 50 structural, 29 functional, 7 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and 8 combined imaging and genetic studies were deemed eligible for systematic review. Structural neuroimaging studies suggest white matter integrity deficits that are consistent across the illnesses, while gray matter reductions appear more widespread in schizophrenia compared to bipolar disorder. Spectroscopy studies in cortical gray matter report evidence of decreased neuronal integrity in both disorders. Functional neuroimaging studies typically report similar functional architecture of brain networks in healthy controls and patients across the psychosis spectrum, but find differential extent of alterations in task related activation and resting state connectivity between illnesses. The very limited imaging-genetic literature suggests a relationship between psychosis risk genes and brain structure, and possible gene by diagnosis interaction effects on functional imaging markers. While the existing literature suggests some shared and some distinct neural markers in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it will be imperative to conduct large, well designed, multi-modal neuroimaging studies in medication-naive first episode patients that will be followed longitudinally over the course of their illness in an effort to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms.

AB  - Recently there is a growing interest in the interaction of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and substance use disorders (SUD), a condition named dual schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD+). While previous research has focused on clinical and cognitive aspects, little is known about the impact of comorbidity in the brain structure and functions. Evidence suggests that dual diagnosis patients, including SSD+, show a better neurocognitive functioning during the first years of illness, followed by a serious long-term decline. The initial search retrieved 94 articles, 12 were excluded for being redundant and 49 for not fulfilling the selection criteria. Thirty-three structural and functional neuroimaging studies that compare SSD and SSD+ patients were included. Both groups exhibited more brain alterations, in comparison to only SUD patients and healthy controls. SSD+ patients are less cognitively and emotionally impaired than non-dual SSD, but worse than healthy controls. The neurobiological alterations are prominent in SSD+ after five years of illness or longer. Moreover, SUD characteristics are important modulating factors, contrary to clinical severity or specific SSD diagnosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. - Neurofeedback is a technique that aims to teach a subject to regulate a brain parameter measured by a technical interface to modulate his/her related brain and cognitive activities. However, the.use of neurofeedback as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders remains controversial. The aim of this review is to summarize and to comment the level of evidence of electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback and real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback for therapeutic application in psychiatry.
   Method. - Literature on neurofeedback and mental disorders but also on brain computer interfaces (BCI) used in the field of neurocognitive science has been considered by the group of expert of the Neurofeedback evaluation & training (NExT) section of the French Association of biological psychiatry and neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN).
   Results. - Results show a potential efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in the treatment of attentionaldeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, even if this is still debated. For other mental disorders, there is too limited research to warrant the use of EEG-neurofeedback in clinical practice. Regarding fMRI neurofeedback, the level of evidence remains too weak, for now, to justify clinical use. The literature review highlights various unclear points, such as indications (psychiatric disorders, pathophysiologic rationale), protocols (brain signals targeted, learning characteristics) and techniques (EEG, fMRI, signal processing).
   Conclusion. - The field of neurofeedback involves psychiatrists, neurophysiologists and researchers in the field of brain computer interfaces. Future studies should determine the criteria for optimizing neurofeedback sessions. A better understanding of the learning processes underpinning neurofeedback could be a key element to develop the use of this technique in clinical practice. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB  - Many studies show that semi-arid rangelands throughout the world have been rapidly converted from a grassland state to a bush encroachment state during the past 50 years. Bush encroachment includes the spread of local woody species and/or incursion of woody species introduced from other ecosystems into semi-arid savannas and grassland ecosystems. Rangeland degradation due to bush encroachment causes several challenges, affecting the production of livestock and pastoral people livelihoods in most parts of Africa. Scientists have long been attempting to develop schematic and mathematical theories to explain the observed phenomenon of bush encroachment, and several theories were proposed and developed. The well-regarded theories include: (1) Walter's two-layer model, (2) Moir's one-layer model, (3) state-and-transition theory, (4) equilibrium theory, (5) disequilibrium theory, and (6) non-equilibrium theory. Within those theories, the most frequently-indicated driving factors that explain bush encroachment include over-grazing, availability of soil nutrient and moisture, elevated CO2 levels, frequency and intensity of fire, spread of seeds of woody species by livestock and wild animals. It should be stressed that couplings and interactions among diverse driving factors are more often at work in determining the condition of bush encroachment. To summarize, the effort in managing semi-arid ecosystems needs critical knowledge to understand the cause-effect relationships of underlying factors through integrated approach. Therefore, future research on encroachment of woody plants should be multi-discipline oriented and multi-partnership involved.

AB  - Introduction: Numerous studies have focused on psychological assessment of bariatric surgery candidates, aiming to identify which psychological variables, including personality characteristics, are related to successful surgical prognosis.
   Objective: To analyze, by means of a systematic literature review, longitudinal studies that investigated personality traits and disorders as possible predictors of outcomes in bariatric surgery.
   Method: PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2005 and 2015, using the keywords "bariatric" AND "personality." Quantitative longitudinal studies in English, Portuguese, or Spanish were selected for review if they assessed personality as an outcome predictor of BS in people aged 18 years or older.
   Results: Sixteen articles were analyzed. The results of this review suggest that externalizing dysfunctions might be associated with less weight reduction, while internalizing dysfunctions appear to be associated with somatic concerns and psychological distress. The persistence dimension (of temperament in Cloninger's model) was positively associated with greater weight loss, while neuroticism (Five Factor Model) and the occurrence of personality disorders were not predictive of weight loss. Furthermore, the results indicate a tendency towards a reduction in personality disorders and neuroticism scores, and an increase in extroversion scores, after BS.
   Conclusions: Assessment of personality characteristics, whether to identify their predictive power or to detect changes during the BS process, is important since it can provide grounds for estimating surgical prognosis and for development of interventions targeting this population.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the impact of physical exercise on cognitive symptoms in depressed adult patients.
   Methods: Systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science TM and CINAHL from inception to August 2016. Two reviewers independently selected randomized trials evaluating the effect of exercise on cognitive functions in patients with a validated diagnosis of depression. Outcome measures included global cognition and different cognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal and visual memory, and reasoning).
   Results: Eight trials met inclusion criteria (637 patients). A fixed-effects model showed absence of beneficial effect on global cognition (Hedges' g = 0.07, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.24, I-2 = 0%) as well as on specific cognitive domains. Sensitivity analyses did not show an impact of exercise in studies with shorter intervention duration compared to longer trials (between group heterogeneity Q = 3.564, df = 1, P = 0.059), single session per week compared to multiple sessions (Q = 2.691, df = 1, P = 0.101) and low exercise intensity compared with moderate/high intensity (Q = 2.952, df = 1, P = 0.086).
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis did not observe a substantial benefit of physical exercise on cognitive symptoms in depression.

AB  - Background: Functioning is one of the key domains emphasised in the routine assessment of outcomes that has been occurring in specialised public sector mental health services across Australia since 2002, via the National Outcomes and Casemix Collection. For adult consumers (aged 18-64), the 16-item Life Skills Profile (LSP-16) has been the instrument of choice to measure functioning. However, review of the National Outcomes and Casemix Collection protocol has highlighted some limitations to the current approach to measuring functioning. A systematic review was conducted to identify, against a set of pre-determined criteria, the most suitable existing clinician-rated instruments for the routine measurement of functioning for adult consumers.
   Method: We used two existing reviews of functioning measures as our starting point and conducted a search of MEDLINE and PsycINFO to identify articles relating to additional clinician-rated instruments. We evaluated identified instruments using a hierarchical, criterion-based approach. The criteria were as follows: (I) is brief (<50 items) and simple to score, (2) is not made redundant by more recent instruments, (3) relevant version has been scientifically scrutinised, (4) considers functioning in a contemporary way and (5) demonstrates sound psychometric properties.
   Results: We identified 20 relevant instruments, 5 of which met our criteria: the LSP-16, the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales, the Illness Management and Recovery Scale Clinician Version, the Multnomah Community Ability Scale and the Personal and Social Performance Scale.
   Conclusion: Further work is required to determine which, if any, of these instruments satisfy further criteria relating to their appropriateness for assessing functioning within relevant service contexts, acceptability to clinicians and consumers, and feasibility in routine practice. This should involve seeking stakeholders' opinions (e.g. about the specific domains of functioning covered by each instrument and the language used in individual items) and testing completion rates in busy service settings.

AB  - Fetal glucocorticoid overexposure is a key mechanism linking early development with later-life disease. In humans, low birth weight associates with increased fasting cortisol, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity, and with cardiovascular risk and cognitive decline. As there are sex differences in these adult diseases, we hypothesized that there may be sex differences in programming of the HPA axis in response to prenatal stressors. We conducted a systematic review following Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. We searched Embase, MEDLINE and Web of Science from inception to 31 October 2016. We included studies related to sex differences, prenatal exposures and HPA axis. We excluded studies investigating specific disease states. The 23 included studies investigated the consequences of low birth weight, preterm birth and maternal stressors of asthma, psychosocial stress and glucocorticoid medications on HPA axis outcomes of placental glucocorticoid biology and offspring HPA axis function in early life and later life. Female offspring exposed to stressors had increased HPA axis reactivity compared with males. Furthermore, the female placenta increased its permeability to maternal glucocorticoids following maternal stress with changes in the expression of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes in response to maternal glucocorticoid exposure or asthma. Among males there was some evidence of altered diurnal cortisol secretion. We conclude that although there is some evidence of male vulnerability leading to altered diurnal cortisol secretion, the female HPA axis is more vulnerable to programming, particularly in terms of its reactivity; this suggests a mechanism underlying sex differences in later-life diseases.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the length of the interval between the onset and the initial management of bipolar disorder (BD).
   Method: We conducted a meta-analysis using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Systematic searches located studies reporting estimates of the age of onset (AOO) and indicators of the age at initial management of BD. We calculated a pooled estimate of the interval between AOO and age at management. Factors influencing between-study heterogeneity were investigated using sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, and multiple meta-regression.
   Results: Twenty-seven studies, reporting 51 samples and a total of 9415 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimate for the interval between the onset of BD and its management was 5.8 years (standardized difference, .53; 95% confidence interval, .45 to .62). There was very high between-sample heterogeneity (I-2 = 92.6; Q = 672). A longer interval was found in studies that defined the onset according to the first episode (compared to onset of symptoms or illness) and defined management as age at diagnosis (rather than first treatment or first hospitalization). A longer interval was reported among more recently published studies, among studies that used a systematic method to establish the chronology of illness, among studies with a smaller proportion of bipolar I patients, and among studies with an earlier mean AOO.
   Conclusions: There is currently little consistency in the way researchers report the AOO and initial management of BD. However, the large interval between onset and management of BD presents an opportunity for earlier intervention.

AB  - Since their discovery in the mammalian brain, it has been apparent that serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) interactions play a key role in normal and abnormal behavior. Therefore, disclosure of this interaction could reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction or neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome. Unfortunately, this interaction remains difficult to study for many reasons, including the rich and widespread innervations of 5-HT and DA in the brain, the plethora of 5-HT receptors and the release of co-transmitters by 5-HT and DA neurons. The purpose of this review is to present electrophysiological and biochemical data showing that endogenous 5-HT and pharmacological 5-HT ligands modify the mesencephalic DA systems' activity. 5-HT receptors may control DA neuron activity in a state-dependent and region-dependent manner. 5-HT controls the activity of DA neurons in a phasic and excitatory manner, except for the control exerted by 5-HT2C receptors which appears to also be tonically and/or constitutively inhibitory. The functional interaction between the two monoamines will also be discussed in view of the mechanism of action of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-Parkinsonians and drugs of abuse.

AB  - Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) address combined risks from exposures to multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors and may focus on vulnerable communities or populations. Significant contributions have been made to the development of concepts, methods, and applications for CRA over the past decade. Work in both human health and ecological cumulative risk has advanced in two different contexts. The first context is the effects of chemical mixtures that share common modes of action, or that cause common adverse outcomes. In this context two primary models are used for predicting mixture effects, dose addition or response addition. The second context is evaluating the combined effects of chemical and nonchemical (e.g., radiation, biological, nutritional, economic, psychological, habitat alteration, land-use change, global climate change, and natural disasters) stressors. CRA can be adapted to address risk in many contexts, and this adaptability is reflected in the range in disciplinary perspectives in the published literature. This article presents the results of a literature search and discusses a range of selected work with the intention to give a broad overview of relevant topics and provide a starting point for researchers interested in CRA applications.

AB  - Objective: The construct of vital exhaustion has been identified as a potential independent psychological risk factor for incident and recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD). Despite several decades of research, no systematic review or metaanalysis has previously attempted to collate the empirical evidence in this field. The purpose of this study was to review and quantify the impact of vital exhaustion on the development and progression of CHD.
   Methods: Prospective and case-control studies reporting vital exhaustion at baseline and CHD outcomes at follow-up were derived from PubMed, PsycINFO (1980 to July 2015; articles in English and published articles only), and bibliographies. Information on aim, study design, sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment methods of psychological risk factors, and results of crude and adjusted regression analyses were abstracted independently by two authors.
   Results: Thirteen prospective (n = 52,636) and three case-control (cases, n = 244; controls, n = 457) studies assessed vital exhaustion and could be summarized in meta-analyses. The pooled adjusted risk of CHD in healthy populations was 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.85) for prospective studies, and 2.61 (95% CI = 1.66-4.10) for case-control studies using hospital controls. Risk of recurrent events in patients with CHD was 2.03 (95% CI = 1.54-2.68). The pooled adjusted risk of chronic heart failure in healthy populations was 1.37 (95% CI = 1.21-1.56), but this was based on results from only two studies.
   Conclusions: Vital exhaustion is associated with increased risk of incident and recurrent CHD.

AB  - The principal mechanism of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein. While the normal function of alpha-synuclein is the control of vesicular neuro-transmission, its pathogenic effects influence different cell functions, including the activities of mitochondria and proteasomes, as well as autophagic protein degradation. It is noteworthy that the same functions are affected when the renewal of macromolecules and organelles is impaired as a result of normal aging. Since aging is the principal risk factor for Parkinson's disease, it is very important to analyze its molecular and cellular consequences in the context of alpha-synuclein pathology. Here, we review the similarities and differences between normal brain aging and Parkinson's disease, with a focus on nigral dopaminergic neurons, which seem to be specifically sensitive to the combined damage induced by alpha-synuclein and aging. Elucidating the mechanism that underlies the death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is essential not only for the understanding of its general pathogenesis but also for the development of approaches to its early preclinical diagnosis and preventive therapy.

AB  - Individuals living with schizophrenia are 2-3 times more likely to experience type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes medication adherence is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a meta analysis of diabetes medication adherence among people with schizophrenia, and compared this to those without schizophrenia. A systematic search strategy was used to identify all articles reporting adherence to diabetes medications among patients with schizophrenia. In total, 10 unique studies reporting data from 33,910 people with schizophrenia were included. Random effects meta-analysis showed people with schizophrenia adhered to medication on 77.3% of days prescribed (n=32080, 95%CI=73.6-81%, I-2=99.2%,), and adhered on 4.6% more days per year than those without schizophrenia (p < 0.01, 95%CI=2.4-6.7%, I-2=92.5%, schizophrenia n=19367, controls=170,853). Furthermore, 56% of individuals with schizophrenia (n=33680) were considered "adherent" (i.e. > 80% adherence over 12-24 month) to diabetes medication, which was significantly more than those without schizophrenia (OR=1.34, 95%C1: 1.18-1.52, p < 0.01). Factors which were positively associated with diabetes medication adherence were age, number of outpatient visits, along with multiple medication administration variables. Future prospective research should examine diabetes monitoring, medication prescription, and subsequent adherence in fully representative samples. Novel interventions for maximizing compliance to diabetes medication in this vulnerable population should also be explored.

AB  - Objective: Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder. It is known that a combination of extensive multiple common alleles may be involved in its etiology, each contributing with a small to moderate effect, and, possibly, some rare alleles with a much larger effect size. We aimed to perform a systematic review of association studies between schizophrenia (and its subphenotypes) and polymorphisms in the CNR1 gene, which encodes cannabinoid receptors classically implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology, as well as to present unpublished results of an association study in a Brazilian population.
   Methods: Two reviewers independently searched for eligible studies and extracted outcome data using a structured form. Papers were retrieved from PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge using the search term schizophrenia in combination with CNR1 or CB1 or cannabinoid receptor. Twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria. We additionally present data from a study of our own comparing 182 patients with schizophrenia and 244 healthy controls.
   Results: No consistent evidence is demonstrated.
   Conclusion: Some seemingly positive association studies stress the need for further investigations of the possible role of endocannabinoid genetics in schizophrenia.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder-specific knowledge deficits contribute to current disparities in the timing and quality of autism spectrum disorder services throughout the United States and globally. This study conducted a systematic review of Western and International literature to examine measures used to assess autism spectrum disorder knowledge. This review identified 44 unique autism spectrum disorder knowledge measures across 67 studies conducted in 21 countries. Measures used in each study were evaluated in terms of psychometric strength. Of the 67 studies reviewed, only 7% were rated as using a measure with strong psychometric support compared to 45% that were rated as using a measure with no reported psychometric support. Additionally, we examined content overlap and subdomains of autism spectrum disorder knowledge assessed (e.g. etiology, symptoms) and cross-cultural adaptation procedures utilized in the field. Based on these findings, the need for a cross-culturally valid and psychometrically sound measure of autism spectrum disorder knowledge is discussed and recommendations for improving current assessment methods are presented, including suggestions for measure subdomains.

AB  - I reply to Stoeber and Gaudreau's (2017) recent commentary on my paper outlining the "perils of partialling" when examining multidimensional perfectionism (Hill, 2014). In my original paper I argued that the conceptual meaning of one of the two superordinate dimensions of perfectionism, perfectionistic strivings, may change once its relationship with the other superordinate dimension, perfectionistic concerns, is controlled for or partialled (i.e., when residual perfectionistic strivings is created and examined). In light of this possibility, I argued that it may be inappropriate or "perilous" to draw conclusions regarding perfectionistic strivings based on residual perfectionistic strivings. Stoeber and Gaudreau disagree. In responding to their commentary, I explain how and why our two perspectives differ. I argue that, despite their view to the contrary, there is sufficient reason to be concerned regarding the conceptual meaning of residual perfectionistic strivings. In addition, I also argue that Stoeber and Gaudreau have misunderstood where the peril lies when using partial correlations and have concluded that my paper called for a rejection of the examination of partial correlations when this was not the case.

AB  - In recent years, the field has witnessed considerable enthusiasm for the ancient practice of mindfulness. The skills derived from this experience, including focused attention, nonjudgmental acceptance of internal experiences and reduced autonomic reactivity, may be helpful in counteracting pathological responses to trauma. Several types of interventions that incorporate principles of mindfulness have been examined for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This nascent literature is inconsistent and methodologically limited but does suggest that mindfulness is a potentially important tool for creating psychological change. The interventions described herein generally would not yet be considered first-line treatments for PTSD. Nonetheless, evidence is building, and mindfulness may provide an impetus for better understanding how to personalize psychological interventions and to evaluate their outcomes.

AB  - The association between urinary cadmium and diabetes risk remains controversial. PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data updated on 21 June 2016 were searched for eligible publications. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of diabetes for highest versus lowest level of urinary cadmium was calculated by using fixed-effect model or random-effect model. Dose-response relationship between urinary cadmium and diabetes was estimated by restricted cubic spline. A total of nine studies with 28,691 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of diabetes for the highest versus lowest level of urinary cadmium was 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00, 1.05; I-2 = 42.3%). In subgroup analysis, the ORs were 1.02 (95% CI 1.00, 1.05; I-2 = 0.9%) for studies conducted in Asia and 1.11 (95% CI 0.88, 1.41; I-2 = 86.3%) in America. For dose-response analysis, a linear relationship was found between urinary cadmium and the risk of diabetes (P-for (nonlinear) = 0.5856). For every 1 mu g/g creatinine increment of urinary cadmium, the risk of diabetes increased by 16% (1.16, 95% CI 1.08, 1.25). This meta-analysis suggests that cadmium exposure might be significantly associated with prevalence of diabetes, but large prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.

AB  - Aim: Mental health is a major concern among adolescents. Most mental illnesses have their onset during this period, and around 14% of all young people aged 12 to 17 years experience a mental illness in a 12-month period. However, only 65% of these adolescents access health services to address their mental health problems. Approximately 70% of all Australian adolescents participate in sport, and this presents an opportunity for mental health promotion.
   Methods: This paper reviewed current approaches by sporting organizations to mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention by searching peak body websites, as well as the wider Internet.
   Results: Findings revealed many of the sport organizations reviewed acknowledged the importance of mental components of their sport to increase competitiveness, but few explicitly noted mental health problems or the potential of their sport to promote good mental health. Although some had participated in mental health promotion campaigns, there was no evaluation or reference to the evidence base for these campaigns.
   Conclusions: We describe a framework for integrating mental health promotion into sports organizations based on the MindMatters programme for schools.

   Results: Twenty-two articles were identified and 12 met the established criteria. Five had been published during the last 4 years. Formation and regulation of positive emotions, including happiness, are associated with significant reductions in activity in the right prefrontal cortex and bilaterally in the temporoparietal cortex, as well as with increased activity in the left prefrontal regions. They are also associated with increased activity in the cingulate gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyri, amygdalae, and ventral striatum.
   Conclusion: It is too early to claim that there is an established understanding of the neuroscience of positive emotions and happiness. However, despite overlap in the brain regions involved in the formation and regulation of positive and negative emotions, we can conclude that positive emotions such as happiness activate specific brain regions.

AB  - Background Suicide is a national and global phenomenon with its rate increasing every year inspite of clinicians, policy makers and researchers grappling with suicide prevention and investing heavily in risk assessment, prevention and reduction. There seems to be a gap in the understanding of suicide and its associated behaviours.
   Aim The aim of this review was to undertake a concept analysis of suicide and behaviour.
   Method The Walker and Avant eight-step method was adopted. Search engines including Academic Search Elite, CINAHL, Ovid Online embracing Embase and Ovid Medline were utilised to access articles published in the last 10 years, written in English, with abstracts and full text.
   Results The concept of suicide require understanding of implicity and explicity of suicidal intent and how these relate to suicide behaviour. Areas of risk assessment such as thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness should be considered. Associated with suicide are internal and external hazards, which tend to create vulnerability leading to suicidal behaviour. Clinicians should differentiate between suicide in the presence of mental illness and when there is a predicament. Risk assessment tools should not be taken as absolute as they do not provide 100 % detection of intent.
   Conclusion Understanding the concept of suicide would help clinicians comprehend their patients and suicidal behaviour and improve intervention methods.

AB  - Background: Self-regulation (SR) is central to developmental psychopathology, but progress has been impeded by varying terminology and meanings across fields and literatures. Methods: The present review attempts to move that discussion forward by noting key sources of prior confusion such as measurement-concept confounding, and then arguing the following major points. Results: First, the field needs a domain-general construct of SR that encompasses SR of action, emotion, and cognition and involves both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. This does not assume a shared core process across emotion, action, and cognition, but is intended to provide clarity on the extent of various claims about kinds of SR. Second, top-down aspects of SR need to be integrated. These include (a) basic processes that develop early and address immediate conflict signals, such as cognitive control and effortful control (EC), and (b) complex cognition and strategies for addressing future conflict, represented by the regulatory application of complex aspects of executive functioning. Executive function (EF) and cognitive control are not identical to SR because they can be used for other activities, but account for top-down aspects of SR at the cognitive level. Third, impulsivity, risk-taking, and disinhibition are distinct although overlapping; a taxonomy of the kinds of breakdowns of SR associated with psychopathology requires their differentiation. Fourth, different aspects of the SR universe can be organized hierarchically in relation to granularity, development, and time. Low-level components assemble into high-level components. This hierarchical perspective is consistent across literatures. Conclusions: It is hoped that the framework outlined here will facilitate integration and cross-talk among investigators working from different perspectives, and facilitate individual differences research on how SR relates to developmental psychopathology.

AB  - A wide range of stressful experiences can influence human decision making in complex ways beyond the simple predictions of a fight-or-flight model. Recent advances may provide insight into this complicated interaction, potentially in directions that could result in translational applications. Early research suggests that stress exposure influences basic neural circuits involved in reward processing and learning, while also biasing decisions toward habit and modulating our propensity to engage in risk-taking. That said, a substantial array of theoretical and methodological considerations in research on the topic challenge strong cross study comparisons necessary for the field to move forward. In this review we examine the multifaceted stress construct in the context of human decision making, emphasizing stress' effect on valuation, learning, and risk-taking.

KW  - Melancholia
KW  - Stochastic
AB  - Brain activity derives from intrinsic dynamics (due to neurophysiology and anatomical connectivity) in concert with stochastic effects that arise from sensory fluctuations, brainstem discharges, and random microscopic states such as thermal noise. The dynamic evolution of systems composed of both dynamic and random fluctuations can be studied with stochastic dynamic models (SDMs). This article, Part II of a two-part series, reviews applications of SDMs to large-scale neural systems in health and disease. Stochastic models have already elucidated a number of pathophysiological phenomena, such as epilepsy and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, although their use in biological psychiatry remains rather nascent. Emerging research in this field includes phenomenological models of mood fluctuations in bipolar disorder and biophysical models of functional imaging data in psychotic and affective disorders. Together with deeper theoretical considerations, this work suggests that SDMs will play a unique and influential role in computational psychiatry, unifying empirical observations with models of perception and behavior.

AB  - Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent kinase family member, is a global orchestrator of neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics. During embryogenesis, Cdk5 is indispensable for brain development. In adults, it is essential for numerous neuronal processes, including higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory formation, drug addiction, pain signaling, and long-term behavior changes through long-term potentiation and long-term depression, all of which rely on rapid alterations in the cytoskeleton. Cdk5 activity becomes deregulated in various brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and ischemic stroke; these all result in profound remodeling of the neuronal cytoskeleton. This Commentary specifically focuses on the pleiotropic contribution of Cdk5 in regulating neuronal microtubule remodeling. Because the vast majority of the physiological substrates of Cdk5 are associated with the neuronal cytoskeleton, our emphasis is on the Cdk5 substrates, such as CRMP2, stathmin, drebrin, dixdc1, axin, MAP2, MAP1B, doublecortin, kinesin-5, and tau, that have allowed to unravel the molecular mechanisms through which Cdk5 exerts its divergent roles in regulating neuronal microtubule dynamics, both in healthy and disease states.

AB  - This paper provides a brief summary and commentary on the growing literature and current developments related to the genetic underpinnings of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first briefly provide an overview of the behavioral genetic literature on PTSD, followed by a short synopsis of the substantial candidate gene literature with a focus on genes that have been meta-analyzed. We then discuss the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have been conducted, followed by an introduction to other molecular platforms used in PTSD genomic studies, such as epigenetic and expression approaches. We close with a discussion of developments in the field that include the creation of the PTSD workgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, statistical advances that can be applied to GWAS data to answer questions of heritability and genetic overlap across phenotypes, and bioinformatics techniques such as gene pathway analyses which will further advance our understanding of the etiology of PTSD.

AB  - Relevant biochemicals of the brain can be quantified in vivo, non-invasively, using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-1 MRS). This includes metabolites associated with neural general functioning, energetics, membrane phospholipid metabolism and neurotransmission. Moreover, there is substantial evidence of implication of the frontal and prefrontal areas in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. In particular, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in cognitive control of emotional and non-emotional processes. Thus the study of its extent of biochemistry dysfunction in the early stages of psychosis is of particular interest in gaining a greater understanding of its aetiology. In this review, we selected H-1 MRS studies focused on the ACC of first-episode psychosis (FEP). Four studies reported increased glutamatergic levels in FEP, while other four showed preserved concentrations. Moreover, findings on FEP do not fully mirror those in chronic patients. Due to conflicting findings, larger longitudinal H-1 MRS studies are expected to further explore glutamatergic neurotransmission in ACC of FEP in order to have a better understanding of the glutamatergic mechanisms underlying psychosis, possibly using ultra high field MR scanners.

AB  - Neonaticide is the killing of a neonate on the day of its birth by his/her own mother. Neonaticidal women were reported to be predominantly young, unmarried, and primiparous. The motive for murdering the newborn relates to the shame, the fear of rejection, and abandonment by significant others, and the social stigmas associated with an illegitimate birth. The goal of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature and identify population-based studies reporting the incidence of neonaticide in different countries. A total of 485 abstracts were screened. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 10 studies were selected. Additional searches identified two more articles. Most of these studies were from Europe, where incidence varied from 0.07 (Finland, 1980-2000 period) to 8.5 neonaticides per 100000 births (Austria, 1975-2001 period). More recent studies have indicated that a growing proportion of neonaticidal women are married, multiparous, and suffers from mental disorders. Preventive measures, such as anonymous free delivery, were shown to reduce the incidence of neonaticide, although this effect may be short-lived. Despite social and institutional changes, neonaticide persists even in the most socially advanced, liberal, and prosperous societies in the world.

AB  - With the more pervasive use of technology, the prevalence of cyberbullying has increased. Universities and colleges have implemented more ways to reach students over the Internet and by other electronic means; consequently, it is important to investigate the prevalence of cyberbullying in higher education. This literature review was created to raise awareness of this continuing trend of cyberbullying among college students. Cyberbullying is defined as intent to consistently harass another individual to cause harm via any electronic method, including social media, and includes defamation, public disclosure of private facts, and intentional emotional distress. An exhaustive search of current literature was conducted using a variety of databases including Academic Search Complete, Education Source, E-Journals, ERIC, PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and PsycINFO. Google, Google Scholar, and reference lists from key studies were also used to gather relevant studies for inclusion in this review. Articles were used to define cyberbullying, build a historical base of cyberbullying among adolescents, examine factors involved in cyberbullying, describe effects of cyberbullying, and examine this trend among college students. Strategies such as reporting, monitoring online interactions, and legal actions to address cyberbullying in all areas of education were included. Future research should investigate if educational programs lead to decreased cyberbullying, increased rates of reporting, and how cyberbullying may change social media etiquette.

AB  - Objective: Allostatic load (AL) represents cumulative wear-and-tear on the body and is operationalized as a multisystem index of biomarkers. Allostatic load is associated with morbidities and mortality, leading to a growing body of literature that uses AL as an outcome in its own right. Psychosocial resources (PSRs), such as mastery and social support, may influence health outcomes in part via AL, and the current review seeks to characterize the relations between PSRs and AL.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase for studies examining the relation between PSR(s) and AL in humans. From 1,417 abstracts screened, 60 full-text articles were reviewed, and 24 studies met inclusion criteria.
   Results: Mixed evidence exists for a relationship between PSRs and AL. Most (14/24) studies used a cross-sectional design, and only one study investigated whether a PSR predicted change in AL. Compared to cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies were more likely to report a significant relationship (8/14 versus 8/10, respectively). Studies with statistically significant main or moderated effects had larger sample sizes than those reporting null effects. Whether a study reported a significant main or moderated relationship did not differ by whether psychological (8/11) or social (10/16) resources were assessed.
   Conclusions: Evidence for a relationship between PSRs and AL is equivocal, and obtained significant relationships are generally small in magnitude. Gaps in the current literature and directions for future research are discussed. Longitudinal studies are needed that repeatedly assess PSRs and AL.

AB  - Medical humanities (MH) is an interdisciplinary field of medicine which includes the humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history, and religion), social sciences (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and health geography), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice. Studies of MH should not be limited to theoretical discussions. Research results must be translated into use of methodologies to formulate medical policies, guide clinical practices, and help resolve physical or mental problems. MH has a critical role in addressing medicine-related issues, such as human cloning legislation and the treatment of Ebola virus infection. Recently, MH has also been included in the "Healthy China 2030" project, indicating that MH has garnered more attention in China. Medical colleges, research institutes, and non-profit organizations are focusing on MH studies. Over the past few years, financial support for MH studies has also increased. Although the development of MH currently lags behind medicine and health sciences, MH has promise.

AB  - Family interventions for psychosis (FIp) are effective in reducing service user relapse and carer distress in people with schizophrenia-spectrum conditions. Several treatment and best practice guidelines recommend FIp for all people with schizophrenia. However, outcome findings in relation to early psychosis groups have been inconsistent. The current paper reports a systematic review and meta-analyses of articles that evaluated FIp in early psychosis with a clearly defined comparison group. A combination of electronic database searches (using PsychINFO, Medline, and CENTRAL), citation searches and hand searches of key journals and reviews was conducted. Peer-reviewed articles published in English from database inception to June 2016 were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP). Seventeen papers from 14 studies met inclusion criteria for review, the overall quality of which was moderate. Meta-analytic synthesis showed that FIp improved service user functioning and reduced the likelihood of relapse by the end of treatment. Psychotic symptoms were significantly reduced in the FIp group at follow up, but this was not evident at end of treatment. In terms of FIp target mechanisms, carers receiving FIp were more likely to shift from high to low expressed emotion and less likely to report patient focused criticism or engage in conflict communication than carers randomized to standard care. Carer burden and well-being were improved by the end of treatment but gains were not sustained at follow up. FIp had no impact on carer emotional over-involvement. The findings indicate that FIp is an effective intervention for early psychosis service users and their relatives. However, further research is required to establish which key therapeutic components of FIp are most effective for whom, in addition to understanding the mechanisms by which FIp might affect positive change.

AB  - Background: In low resource settings, short, valid and reliable instruments with good high sensitivity and specificity are essential for the screening of depression in antenatal care. A review of published evidence on screening instruments for depression for use in antenatal services in low resource settings was conducted. The aim of this review was to appraise the best available evidence on screening instruments suitable for detecting depression in antenatal care in low resource settings.
   Methods: Searching, selection, quality assessment, and data abstraction was done by two reviewers. ScienceDirect, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, SABINET and PsychARTICLES databases were searched using relevant search terms. Retrieved studies were evaluated for relevancy (whether psychometric data were reported) and quality. Data were synthesised and sensitivity and specificity of instruments were pooled using forest plots.
   Results: Eleven articles were included in the review. The methodological quality ranged from adequate to excellent. The review found 7 tools with varying levels of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Beck Depression Index, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 20, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and Self- Reporting Questionnaire. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was most common and had the highest level of accuracy (AUC =.965) and sensitivity.
   Conclusion: This review suggests that the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale can be a suitable instrument of preference for screening antenatal depression in low resource settings because of the reported level of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

   To examine the effects of cognitive remediation therapies on brain functioning through neuroimaging procedures in patients with schizophrenia.
   METHODS
   A systematic, computerised literature search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline and PsychInfo databases. The search was performed through February 2016 without any restrictions on language or publication date. The search was performed using the following search terms: [("cogniti*" and "remediation" or "training" or "enhancement") and ("fMRI" or "MRI" or "PET" or "SPECT") and (schizophrenia or schiz*)]. The search was accompanied by a manual online search and a review of the references from each of the papers selected, and those papers fulfilling our inclusion criteria were also included.
   RESULTS
   A total of 101 studies were found, but only 18 of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies indicated that cognitive remediation improves brain activation in neuroimaging studies. The most commonly reported changes were those that involved the prefrontal and thalamic regions. Those findings are in agreement with the hypofrontality hypothesis, which proposes that frontal hypoactivation is the underlying mechanism of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Nonetheless, great heterogeneity among the studies was found. They presented different hypotheses, different results and different findings. The results of more recent studies interpreted cognitive recovery within broader frameworks, namely, as amelioration of the efficiency of different networks. Furthermore, advances in neuroimaging methodologies, such as the use of whole-brain analysis, tractography, graph analysis, and other sophisticated methodologies of data processing, might be conditioning the interpretation of results and generating new theoretical frameworks. Additionally, structural changes were described in both the grey and white matter, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of cognitive remediation. Cognitive, functional and structural improvements tended to be positively correlated.
   CONCLUSION
   Neuroimaging studies of cognitive remediation in patients with schizophrenia suggest a positive effect on brain functioning in terms of the functional reorganisation of neural networks.

AB  - For nearly a century, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has proven to be a valuable tool in our understanding of fundamental biological processes, and has empowered our discoveries, particularly in the field of neuroscience. In recent years, Drosophil a has emerged as a model organism for human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders. In this review, we highlight a number of recent studies that utilized the Drosophila model to study repeat-expansion associated diseases (READs), such as polyglutamine diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2), and C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Discoveries regarding the possible mechanisms of RNA toxicity will be focused here. These studies demonstrate Drosophila as an excellent in vivo model system that can reveal novel mechanistic insights into human disorders, providing the foundation for translational research and therapeutic development.

AB  - Norepinephrine (NE) is recognized as having a key role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia, although its distinct actions via a-adrenergic receptors (alpha-ARs) are not well defined. We performed a systematic review examining the roles of NE and alpha-ARs in MDD and schizophrenia. PubMed and ProQuest database searches were performed to identify English language papers published between 2008 and 2015. In total, 2,427 publications (PubMed, n = 669; ProQuest, n = 1,758) were identified. Duplicates, articles deemed not relevant, case studies, reviews, meta-analyses, preclinical reports, or articles on non-target indications were excluded. To limit the review to the most recent data representative of the literature, the review further focused on publications from 2010 to 2015, which were screened independently by all authors. A total of 16 research reports were identified: six clinical trial reports, six genetic studies, two biomarker studies, and two receptor studies. Overall, the studies provided indirect evidence that alpha-AR activity may play an important role in aberrant regulation of cognition, arousal, and valence systems associated with MDD and schizophrenia. Characterization of the NE pathway in patients may provide clinicians with information for more personalized therapy of these heterogeneous diseases. Current clinical studies do not provide direct evidence to support the role of NE alpha-ARs in the pathophysiology of MDD and schizophrenia and in the treatment response of patients with these diseases, in particular with relation to specific valence systems. Clinical studies that attempt to define associations between specific receptor binding profiles of psychotropics and particular clinical outcomes are needed.

AB  - Background: Insight into the change from pre- to post-injury health-related quality of life (HRQL) of trauma patients is important to derive estimates of the impact of injury on HRQL. Prospectively collected pre-injury HRQL data are, however, often not available due to the difficulty to collect these data before the injury. We performed a systematic review on the current methods used to assess pre-injury health status and to estimate the change from pre- to post-injury HRQL due to an injury.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and other databases. We identified studies that reported on the pre-injury HRQL of trauma patients. Articles were collated by type of injury and HRQL instrument used. Reported pre-injury HRQL scores were compared with general age-and gender-adjusted norms for the EQ-5D, SF-36, and SF-12.
   Results: We retrieved results from 31 eligible studies, described in 41 publications. All but two studies used retrospective assessment and asked patients to recall their pre-injury HRQL, showing widely varying timings of assessments (soon after injury up to years after injury). These studies commonly applied the SF-36 (n = 13), EQ-5D (n = 9), or SF-12 (n = 3) using questionnaires (n = 14) or face-to-face interviews (n = 11). Two studies reported prospective pre-injury assessment, based on prospective longitudinal cohort studies from a sample of initially non-injured patients, and applied questionnaires using the SF-36 or SF-12. The recalled pre-injury HRQL scores of injury patients consistently exceeded age-and sex-adjusted population norms, except in a limited number of studies on injury types of higher severity (e.g., traumatic brain injury and hip fractures). All studies reported reduced post-injury HRQL compared to pre-injury HRQL. Both prospective studies reported that patients had recovered to their pre-injury levels of physical and mental health, while in all but one retrospective study patients did not regain the reported pre-injury levels of HRQL, even years after injury.
   Conclusions: So far, primarily retrospective research has been conducted to assess pre-injury HRQL. This research shows consistently higher pre-injury HRQL scores than population norms and a recovery that lags behind that of prospective assessments, implying a systematic overestimation of the change in HRQL from pre- to post-injury due to an injury. More prospective research is necessary to examine the effect of recall bias and response shift. Researchers should be aware of the bias that may arise when pre-injury HRQL is assessed retrospectively or when population norms are applied, and should use prospectively derived HRQL scores wherever possible to estimate the impact of injury on HRQL.

AB  - Ponto-Geniculo-Occipital (PGO) waves are biphasic field potentials identified in a range of mammalian species that are ubiquitous with sleep, but can also be identified in waking perception and eye movement. Their role in REM sleep and visual perception more broadly may constitute a promising avenue for further research, however what was once an active field of study has recently fallen into stasis. With the reality that invasive recordings performed on animals cannot be replicated in humans; while animals themselves cannot convey experience to the extent required to elucidate how PGO waves factor into awareness and behavior, innovative solutions are required if significant research outcomes are to ever be realized. Advances in non-invasive imaging technologies and sophistication in imaging methods now offer substantial scope to renew the study of the electrophysiological substrates of waking and dreaming perception. Among these, Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) stands out through its capacity to measure deep brain activations with high temporal resolution. With the current trend in sleep and dream research to produce translational findings of psychopathological and medical significance, in addition to the clear links that PGO wave generation sites share, pharmacologically, with receptors involved in expression of mental illness; there is a strong case to support scientific research into PGO waves and develop a functional understanding of their broader role in human perception.

AB  - People with psychosis have high prevalence of low vitamin D levels but the correlates and relevance of this deficiency are unclear. A systematic search of major databases from inception to 03/2016 was undertaken investigating correlates of vitamin D in people with psychosis. Data was summarised with a best evidence synthesis. Across 23 included studies (n=1770 psychosis, n=8171 controls) a mean difference in vitamin D levels between both groups of 11.14 ng/ml 0.59 was found. 53 unique correlations between vitamin D and outcomes in people with psychosis were identified. The evidence base was broadly equivocal although season of blood sampling (67% of studies found a positive correlation with warmer seasons) and parathyroid hormone (100% of studies found a negative correlation) were associated with vitamin D levels. The most commonly non correlated variables were: BMI (83% found no correlation), age (73%), gender (86%), smoking (100%), duration of illness (100%) and general assessment of functioning score (100%). In conclusion, whilst many unique correlates have been investigated, there is weak and inconclusive evidence regarding the consistency and meaning of the correlates of vitamin D levels in people with psychosis. Future longitudinal studies should consider the correlates of vitamin D in people with psychosis.

   Nanotechnology typically deals with the measuring and modeling of matter at nanometer scale by incorporating the fields of engineering and technology. The most prominent feature of these engineered materials involves their manipulation/modification for imparting new functional properties. The current review covers the most recent findings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics based on nanoscience and technology.
   Recent findings
   Current studies involve the application of nanotechnology in developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders. Nanotechnology-based approaches can be exploited for limiting/reversing these diseases for promoting functional regeneration of damaged neurons. These strategies offer neuroprotection by facilitating the delivery of drugs and small molecules more effectively across the blood-brain barrier.
   Summary
   Nanotechnology based approaches show promise in improving AD therapeutics. Further replication work on synthesis and surface modification of nanoparticles, longer-term clinical trials, and attempts to increase their impact in treating AD are required.

AB  - Empathy is a complex construct, thought to contain multiple components. One popular measurement paradigm, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), has been used extensively to measure empathic tendencies in schizophrenia research across four domains: empathic concern, perspective-taking, personal distress, and fantasy. However, no recent meta-analysis has been conducted for all four factors of this scale. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine self-reported empathic tendencies for each factor of the IRI in people with schizophrenia as compared to healthy controls. A literature search revealed 32 eligible schizophrenia studies. The Hedges' g standardized difference effect size was calculated for each component using a random effects meta-analytic model. Compared to healthy controls, schizophrenia samples reported significantly reduced tendencies for empathic concern, perspective-taking, and fantasy, but significantly greater tendencies for personal distress. Duration of illness significantly moderated the results for perspective-taking such that those with a longer duration exhibited greater deficits; percent female significantly moderated the results for personal distress such that samples with more females exhibited reduced effect sizes. Future work is needed to examine the impact of heightened personal distress on the empathic tendencies and abilities of those with schizophrenia, including the possible role of emotion regulation.

Themes in neuropsychology through the years will be highlighted alongside discussion of how neuropsychologists and neuropsychological research have influenced and have been influenced by the DSM. The DSM 5 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mild neurocognitive disorder will be used as examples to reflect the evolution of the disorders in relation to neuropsychology and the DSM. In particular, recent criticism and research regarding the nosology of both disorders and future directions will be presented in the context of neuropsychology and DSM. Finally, influence regarding changes to the DSM 5 on neuropsychology in clinical decision making, test selection, and diagnosis will be discussed.

AB  - Backgrounds: The effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and bilateral, left prefrontal, and right prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on major depressive disorder (MDD) have not been adequately addressed by previous studies. Here, a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which incorporates evidence from direct and indirect comparisons from a network of trials, was performed to assess the efficacy and acceptability of these four treatment modalities on MDD.
   Method: The literature was searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ECT, bilateral rTMS, and unilateral rTMS for treating MDD up to May 2016. The main outcome measures were response and drop-out rates.
   Results: Data were obtained from 25 studies consisting of 1288 individuals with MDD. ECT was non-significantly more efficacious than B-rTMS, R-rTMS, and L-rTMS. Left prefrontal rTMS was non significantly less efficacious than all other treatment modalities. In terms of acceptability, R-rTMS was non-significantly better tolerated than ECT, B-rTMS, and L-rTMS. ECT was the most efficacious treatment with the cumulative probabilities of being the most efficacious treatment being: ECT (65%), B-rTMS (25%), R-rTMS (8%), and L-rTMS (2%). R-rTMS was the best-tolerated treatment with the cumulative probabilities of being the best-tolerated treatment being: R-rTMS (52%), B-rTMS (17%), L-rTMS (16%), and ECT (14%). Coherence analysis detected no statistically significant incoherence in any comparisons of direct with indirect evidence for the response rate and drop-out rate.
   Conclusions: ECT was the most efficacious, but least tolerated, treatment, while R-rTMS was the best tolerated treatment for MDD. B-rTMS appears to have the most favorable balance between efficacy and acceptability. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) may be the first manifestation of an underlying neurocognitive disorder. We undertook a review to provide an update on the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS that occur in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and just before the onset of MCI. We discuss common clinical presentations and the implications for diagnosis and care.
   Method: The authors conducted a selective review of the literature regarding the emergence of NPS in late life, before and after the onset of MCI. We discuss recent publications that explore the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS in the earliest clinical stages of these disorders.
   Results: NPS have been reported in 35% to 85% of adults with MCI and also occur in advance of cognitive decline. The occurrence of NPS for the first time in later life should increase suspicion for an underlying neurocognitive disorder. The presenting symptom may provide a clue regarding the etiology of the underlying disorder, and the co-occurrence of NPS may herald a more accelerated cognitive decline.
   Conclusions: NPS are prevalent in the early clinical stages of neurocognitive disorders and can serve as both useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Recognition of NPS as early manifestations of neurocognitive disorders will become increasingly important as we move towards preventative strategies and disease-modifying treatments that may be most effective when deployed in the earliest stages of disease.

AB  - The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how we experience qualia or phenomenal experiences, such as seeing, hearing, and feeling, and knowing what they are. To solve this problem, a theory of consciousness needs to link brain to mind by modeling how emergent properties of several brain mechanisms interacting together embody detailed properties of individual conscious psychological experiences. This article summarizes evidence that Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, accomplishes this goal. ART is a cognitive and neural theory of how advanced brains autonomously learn to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. ART has predicted that "all conscious states are resonant states'' as part of its specification of mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. It hereby provides functional and mechanistic explanations of data ranging from individual spikes and their synchronization to the dynamics of conscious perceptual, cognitive, and cognitive-emotional experiences. ART has reached sufficient maturity to begin classifying the brain resonances that support conscious experiences of seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing. Psychological and neurobiological data in both normal individuals and clinical patients are clarified by this classification. This analysis also explains why not all resonances become conscious, and why not all brain dynamics are resonant. The global organization of the brain into computationally complementary cortical processing streams (complementary computing), and the organization of the cerebral cortex into characteristic layers of cells (laminar computing), figure prominently in these explanations of conscious and unconscious processes. Alternative models of consciousness are also discussed. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: It is unclear as to which interventions are effective at improving medication adherence in individuals with serious and persistent mental illness. The goal of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence examining the effectiveness, harms, and costs of interventions to improve medication adherence in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of several electronic databases through January 2015 using a structured search strategy. Studies were included if they involved adult patients in general mental health settings, reported both measures of medication adherence and clinical outcomes, and were of sufficient methodological rigor. Studies were quality assessed and synthesized using established methods. Results: We idented 24 studies that met inclusion criteria. Overall, 20 studies addressed interventions in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders. These interventions varied widely, with generally mixed findings contributing to low or insufficient strength of evidence; studies involving family members and technology interventions were the most consistently associated with a positive effect; however, the strength of the evidence was low because of intervention heterogeneity. The evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of interventions in patients with bipolar disorder. Conclusions: In individuals with psychotic spectrum disorders, interventions with family members or technology had the most consistent positive effect on adherence, although replication with objective adherence measures along with evaluation of harms and costs is needed. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about interventions in individuals with bipolar disorder.

AB  - Objectives. To review the available clinical guidelines from Canada, North America, Europe and the United Kingdom for the diagnosis and management of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for adolescents previously diagnosed in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) on transition to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) and for adults presenting with a diagnostic query re-ADHD. This article seeks to apply the available guidelines to an Irish context.
   Method. Various clinical guidelines and consensus statements were identified by a literature search of PubMed, incorporating literature from the past 10 years from English speaking countries and inclusion of any additional guidelines of clinical relevance. A clinical guideline with specific reference for Irish clinicians was proposed for the diagnosis and management of adults presenting for the first time with a diagnostic query re-ADHD and also to include those young adults previously diagnosed in CAMHS on transition to AMHS.
   Conclusions. ADHD is a lifelong disorder, which if undiagnosed or untreated can lead to significant impairment resulting in a high economic cost for society. Stimulant medication is a first-line treatment option for adults with ADHD; however, some formulations are unlicensed in Ireland. Recent licensing of Atomoxetine, for both adolescents on transition and for adults with newly diagnosed ADHD is a welcome development. Third-line agents are rarely prescribed due to their side effect profiles and are prescribed off-label:
   It is important to establish clinical guidelines for an Irish context incorporating a biopsychosocial approach. Further discussion amongst clinicians and stakeholders is needed to plan service development.

AB  - Video is considered to be an effective, easy to use tool employed in anti-stigma interventions among young people. Mass media has been shown to be effective for reducing stigma; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine the destigmatization effects of videos specifically. This article systematically reviews the effectiveness of video intervention in reducing stigma among young people between 13 and 25 years. We searched 13 electronic databases including randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, and controlled before and after studies. Of the 1426 abstracts identified, 23 studies (reported in 22 papers) met the inclusion criteria. Video interventions led to improvements in stigmatising attitudes. Video was found to be more effective than other interventions, such as classical face-to-face educational sessions or simulation of hallucinations. According to results of two studies, social contact delivered via video achieved similar destigmatization effect to that delivered via a live intervention. Although the quality of studies as well as the form of video interventions varied, the findings suggest that video is a promising destigmatization tool among young people; however, more studies in this area are needed. There was a lack of evidence for interventions outside of school environments, in low-and middle-income countries, and studies, which looked at long-term outcomes or measured impact on actual behaviour and implicit attitudes. The review generates recommendations for video interventions targeted at young people. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Canadian Arctic is uniquely sensitive to climate change impacts, including rapidly warming temperatures, sea ice change, and permafrost degradation. Adaptation-including efforts to manage climate change risks, reduce damages, and take advantage of new opportunities-has been identified as a priority for policy action across government levels. However, our understanding of adaptation in the Canadian North is limited: Is adaptation taking place, to what stresses, and what does it look like? In this paper we answer these questions for the Inuit territory of Nunavut, systematically cataloguing and reviewing government-led adaptation programs and policies at community, territorial, and federal levels, drawing on publically available information. We documented a total of 700 discrete adaptation initiatives. The focus on adaptation to-date has primarily been at the groundwork level, aimed at informing and preparing for adaptation through impact assessments, adaptation planning exercises, and stakeholder engagement. Adaptation in Nunavut has been driven by cross-scale coordination and leadership from the territorial and federal government. Our study finds few examples of concrete actions for planned adaptation, such as changes to or creation of policies that enable adaptation, alterations to building codes and infrastructure design with changing geohazards, or enhanced disaster planning and emergency preparedness in light of projected impacts. This study indicates a need for formal adaptation plans for the Governments of Canada and Nunavut, emphasis on adaptation monitoring and evaluation, and a greater role of Inuit traditional knowledge and cultural values in adaptation policy.

A growing body of research indicates that restoring perturbed mTOR signaling in PD models can prevent neuronal cell death. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms underlying mTOR-mediated effects in PD have not been fully understood yet. Here, we review recent progress in characterizing the association of mTOR signaling with PD risk factors and further discuss the potential roles of mTOR in PD.

   Methods: We conducted a selective evidence-based review of the literature using Pubmed and EMBASE databases and selected most recent and relevant papers for this review.
   Results: There are several available psychotropic drugs for the treatment of patients with intellectual disability and comorbid psychiatric disorders, although scientific evidence is limited. Treatment should be individualized according to risk-benefit balance.
   Discussion: Further studies are needed and new available drugs should be considered to gain knowledge in effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches available in this population.

AB  - Considerable effort has been made to address the issue of occupational health and environmental exposure to mercury. This review reports on the current literature of mercury exposure and health impacts on dental personnel. Citations were searched using four comprehensive electronic databases for articles published between 2002 and 2015. All original articles that evaluated an association between the use of dental amalgam and occupational mercury exposure in dental personnel were included. Fifteen publications from nine different countries met the selection criteria. The design and quality of the studies showed significant variation, particularly in the choice of biomarkers as an indicator of mercury exposure. In several countries, dental personnel had higher mercury levels in biological fluids and tissues than in control groups; some work practices increased mercury exposure but the exposure levels remained below recommended guidelines. Dental personnel reported more health conditions, often involving the central nervous system, than the control groups. Clinical symptoms reported by dental professionals may be associated with low-level, long-term exposure to occupational mercury, but may also be due to the effects of aging, occupational overuse, and stress. It is important that dental personnel, researchers, and educators continue to encourage and monitor good work practices by dental professionals.

AB  - Purpose of review
   This review summarises the recent trends in research in the field of self-injurious behaviour in people with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.
   Recent findings
   New data on incidence, persistence and severity add to studies of prevalence to indicate the large scale of the clinical need. A number of person characteristics have been repeatedly identified in prevalence and cohort studies that: can be considered as risk markers (e.g. stereotyped behaviour, autism spectrum disorder) and indicate possible causal mechanisms (e.g. sleep disorder, anxiety). Studies have started to integrate traditional operant learning paradigms with known person characteristics and reviews and meta-analyses of applied behaviour analytic procedures can now inform practice.
   Summary
   Despite these positive developments interventions and appropriate support falls far short of the required need. Expansions in applied research are warranted to develop and evaluate innovative service delivery models that can translate knowledge of risk markers and operant learning paradigms into widespread, low cost routine clinical practice. Alongside this, further pure research is needed to elucidate the direction of causality of implicated risk factors, in order to understand and intervene more effectively in self-injury.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cariprazine (RGH-188) is a novel antipsychotic drug that exerts partial agonism of dopamine D2/D3 receptors with preferential binding to D3 receptor, antagonism of 5HT2B receptors and partial agonism of 5HT1A. Its interesting pharmacodynamic profile suggests its potential in the treatment of a plethora of psychiatric disorders. The present comprehensive review aims at summarizing the current evidence about the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cariprazine in the treatment of schizophrenia, BD (manic/mixed/depressive episode) and MDD.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was here carried out on PubMed/Medline/Scopus and the database on Clinical Trials from inception until December 2015 by typing a set of specified keywords.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Cariprazine appears to be efficacy in the treatment of cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Preliminary findings suggest its antimanic activity whilst it is still under investigation its efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression and MDD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Further studies should be needed in order to better identify its clinical efficacy profile.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a common, severe and chronically disabling mental illness. Most of MRI studies in schizophrenia suggest the involvement of white matter (WM) pathology in multiple cerebral regions in the neurobiology of this condition. White matter fiber tracts connecting numerous cortical regions have been the focus of a number of studies using a magnetic resonance technique called "Diffusion Tensor Imaging" (DTI). A literature search of published DTI studies was conducted using the major database National Centre for Biotechnology information (NCBI) PubMed (MEDLINE). Our review covers 95 published papers. We summarise the main DTI findings involving the different brain regions in patients affected by or at high-risk for psychosis; we discuss clinical implications of these white matter disruptions and the limitations of current studies, listing the potential confounds and suggesting potential future research directions.

AB  - Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling influences neurogenesis and neural patterning during the development of central nervous system. Dysregulation of Shh signaling in brain leads to neurological disorders like autism spectrum disorder, depression, dementia, stroke, Parkinson's diseases, Huntington's disease, locomotor deficit, epilepsy, demyelinating disease, neuropathies as well as brain tumors. The synthesis, processing and transport of Shh ligand as well as the localization of its receptors and signal transduction in the central nervous system has been carefully reviewed. Further, we summarize the regulation of small molecule modulators of Shh pathway with potential in neurological disorders. In conclusion, further studies are warranted to demonstrate the potential of positive and negative regulators of the Shh pathway in neurological disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), is a gut-derived, orexigenic peptide hormone that primarily regulates growth hormone secretion, food intake, and energy homeostasis. With the wide expression of GHS-R1a in extra-hypothalamic regions, the physiological role of ghrelin is more extensive than solely its involvement in metabolic function. Ghrelin has been shown to be involved in numerous higher brain functions, such as memory, reward, mood, and sleep. Some of these functions are disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). This link between ghrelin and these neurodegenerative diseases is supported by numerous studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent evidence of the novel neuromodulatory role of ghrelin in PD, AD, and HD. Moreover, the changes in circulating and/or central ghrelin levels that are associated with disease progression are also postulated to be a biomarker for clinical diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - Background: Depression is a major debilitating psychiatric disorder. Current antidepressant drugs are often associated with side effects or treatment resistance. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate therapeutic effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) in major depression (MD). Methods: The medical data bases of PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the therapeutic effects of high-frequency rTMS for depression, which were published in English between January 1990 and June 2016. The index terms were `` depress*'', `` depression'' and `` transcranial magnetic stimulation''. Depression outcome data of different sessions (5, 10, 15, and 20 sessions of rTMS treatment) were extracted and synthesized by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by using a randomeffect model. Within each session group, the subgroup analyses based on the number of pulses (<= 1000, 1200-1500, 1600-1800, and 2000-3000) were also conducted. Results: Thirty RCTs with a total of 1754 subjects including 1136 in the rTMS group and 618 in the sham group were included in this meta-analysis. rTMS had a significant overall therapeutic effect on depression severity scores (SMD = -0.73, P < 0.00001). The five, 10, 15, 20 sessions of rTMS treatments yielded the significant mean effect sizes of -0.43, -0.60, -1.13, and -2.74, respectively. In the four groups (5, 10, 15, 20 sessions), the maximal mean effect size was all obtained in the subgroup of 12001500 pulses per day (-0.97, -1.14, -1.91, -5.47; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The increasing of HF-rTMS sessions is associated with the increased efficacy of HF-rTMS in reducing depressed patients' symptom severity. A total number of pulses of 1200-1500 per day appear to deliver the best antidepressant effects of HF-rTMS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the gender gap in math course-taking and performance has narrowed in recent decades, females continue to be underrepresented in math-intensive fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Career pathways encompass the ability to pursue a career as well as the motivation to employ that ability. Individual differences in cognitive capacity and motivation are also influenced by broader sociocultural factors. After reviewing research from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics, and education over the past 30 years, we summarize six explanations for US women's underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields: (a) cognitive ability, (b) relative cognitive strengths, (c) occupational interests or preferences, (d) lifestyle values or work-family balance preferences, (e) field-specific ability beliefs, and (f) gender-related stereotypes and biases. We then describe the potential biological and sociocultural explanations for observed gender differences on cognitive and motivational factors and demonstrate the developmental period(s) during which each factor becomes most relevant. We then propose evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice to improve STEM diversity and recommendations for future research directions.

AB  - Purpose: The primary aim of this study was to review the impact of sport-based interventions (SBI) on the psychological well-being of people in prison. Secondary aims were to identify whether psychological theory of health behaviour change was included in the design and evaluation of interventions, and the inclusion of additional non-sporting components.
   Methods: A textual narrative synthesis followed a systematic search of six databases, based on PRISMA guidelines, and conducted during April 2016. Inclusion criteria were people in prison, aged 15 or over, involved in a facilitated SBI. The outcome was impact on psychological well-being and all study designs were considered. Search results were reduced from 10,749 studies, to 14 (nine quantitative and five qualitative) after screening.
   Results: Interventions lasted from six weeks to nine months, with nine being multi-component. A positive affect on psychological well-being or related variable was reported in twelve studies. However, there were inconsistencies in measurement, a lack of baseline data and limited follow-up. Health behaviour change theories were a notable omission across the interventions.
   Conclusions: SBIs display a positive trend toward beneficial impact on psychological well-being within prisons. However, future studies should aim to address identified measurement inconsistencies and weak research design, and also include psychological change theory in their design. This will better enable practitioners and researchers alike to identify the key psychological mechanisms impacted and how, subsequently implementing SBIs with increased understanding and confidence in their contribution to prisoner psychological well-being.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The major characteristics of PD include the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and Lewy body depositions. Genetic defects, environment toxicants, and aging have been recognized as risk factors for the development of PD. Currently, although the pathogenesis of PD is still obscure, overwhelming evidence demonstrates that oxidative stress plays a central role in the progress of PD. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function mainly through chemical reactions with atomic targets that lead to covalent oxidative modifications. Through the oxidative modification of ions, amino acids, amines, and nucleic acids, ROS exert augmented effects on the structures and functions of multiple macromolecules. These oxidative modifications can affect nucleic acid stability by oxidizing RNA, increasing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, and launching translesion synthesis (TLS); disturb protein homeostasis by accelerating alpha-synuclein aggregation, parkin aggregation, and proteasome dissociation; modulate dopamine release by activating ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP) and inactivating neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs); and influence cellular self-defenses by promoting the cytoprotective effects of DJ-1 and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) while inducing Akt dysregulation. Based on the above facts, we propose that various oxidative modifications may affect nucleic acid stability, protein homeostasis, the functionality of ion channels, and cellular self-defenses and that these processes lead to protein misfolding, dopamine depletion, and further neuronal death in PD.

AB  - Some scholars have noted that an impressive number of self-related terms have been gradually introduced in the scientific literature. Several of these terms are either ill-defined or synonymous, creating confusion, and redundancy. In an effort to minimize this problem, I present a novel and systematic way of looking at possible relations between several key self-terms. I also propose a tentative classification scheme of self-terms as follows: (1) basic terms related to the overall process of self-perception (e.g., self-awareness), (2) non self-terms that are importantly associated to some other self-terms (e.g., consciousness and Theory of Mind), (3) processes related to the executive self and involving agency, volition, and self-control (e.g., self-regulation), and (4) self-views, that is, the content and feelings about the self (e.g., self-esteem). Three additional categories not discussed in this paper are self-biases, reactions to the self, and interpersonal style. Arguably unambiguous definitions for some of the most important and frequently used self-terms are suggested. These are presented in tables meant for the reader to search for definitions as well as related terms.

AB  - Embodied cognition is a theoretical framework which posits that cognitive function is intimately intertwined with the body and physical actions. Although the field of psychology is increasingly accepting embodied cognition as a viable theory, it has rarely been employed in the gerontological literature. However, embodied cognition would appear to have explanatory power for aging research given that older adults typically manifest concurrent physical and mental changes, and that research has indicated a correlative relationship between such changes. The current paper reviews age-related changes in sensory processing, mental representation, and the action-perception relationship, exploring how each can be understood through the lens of embodied cognition. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibit across all three domains an increased tendency to favor visual processing over bodily factors, leading to the conclusion that older adults are less embodied than young adults. We explore the significance of this finding in light of existing theoretical models of aging and argue that embodied cognition can benefit gerontological research by identifying further factors that can explain the cause of age-related declines.

AB  - Background: Cultural competency is a multifaceted intervention approach, which needs to be implemented at various levels of health-care systems to improve quality of care for culturally and ethnically diverse populations. One level of health care where cultural competency is required is in the provision of health promotion services and programs targeted to diverse patient groups who experience health-care and health inequalities. To inform the implementation and evaluation of health promotion programs and services to improve cultural competency, research must assess both intervention strategies and intervention outcomes.
   Methods: This scoping review was completed as part of a larger systematic literature search conducted on evaluations of cultural competence interventions in health care in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Seventeen peer-reviewed databases, 13 websites and clearinghouses, and 11 literature reviews were searched. Overall, 64 studies on cultural competency interventions were found, with 22 being health promotion programs and services. A process of thematic analysis was utilized to identify key intervention strategies and outcomes reported in the literature.
   Results: The review identified three overarching strategies utilized in health promotion services and programs to improve cultural competency: community-focused strategies, culturally focused strategies, and language-focused strategies. Studies took different approaches to delivering culturally competent health interventions, with the majority incorporating multiple strategies from each overarching category. There were various intermediate health-care and health outcomes reported across the included studies. Most commonly reported were positive reports of patient satisfaction, patient/participant service access, and program/study retention rates. The health outcome results indicate positive potential of health promotion services and programs to improve cultural competency to impact cardiovascular disease and mental health outcomes. However, due to measurement and study quality issues, it is difficult to determine the extent of the impacts.
   Discussion: Examined together, these intervention strategies and outcomes provide a framework that can be used by service providers and researchers in the implementation and evaluation of health promotion services and programs to improve cultural competency. While there is evidence indicating the effectiveness of such health promotion interventions in improving intermediate and health outcomes, further attention is needed to issues of measurement and study quality.

AB  - Chronic pain (CP) is a burdensome symptom. Different psychological models have been proposed to explain the role of psychological and social factors in developing and maintaining CP. Attachment, for example, is a psychological construct of possible relevance in CP. The first studies on the role of attachment in CP did not investigate the partner's psychological factors, thus neglecting the influence of the latter. The main aim of this mini-review was to examine the more recent literature investigating the relationship between CP and attachment style. In particular, whether or not more recent studies assessed the psychological variables of a patient's partner. The articles were selected from the Medline/PubMed database using the search terms "attachment" AND "pain"; "CP" AND "attachment style," which led to nine papers being identified. The results showed that, even though the key point was still the hypothesis that an insecure attachment style is associated with CP, in recent years researchers have focused on the possible psychological aspects mediating between attachment style and CP. In particular, worrying, coping strategies, catastrophizing and perceived spouse responses to pain behavior were taken into account. Only one study considered the role of the reciprocal influence of attachment style of both patient and partner, underlining the role of real significant others' responses to pain behaviors. In conclusion, the results of the present mini-review highlight how in recent years researchers have moved toward investigating those psychological aspects that could mediate the relationship between attachment and CP, while only partially evaluating the interpersonal perspective.

AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is investigated to modulate neuronal function including cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatric therapies. While cases of human stimulation with rudimentary batteries date back more than 200 years, clinical trials with current controlled stimulation were published intermittently since the 1960s. The modern era of tDCS only started after 1998.
   Objectives: To review methods and outcomes of tDCS studies from old literature (between 1960 and 1998) with intention of providing new insight for ongoing tDCS trials and development of tDCS protocols especially for the purpose of treatment.
   Methods: Articles were identified through a search in PubMed and through the reference list from its selected articles. We included only non-invasive human studies that provided controlled direct current and were written in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese before the year of 1998, the date in which modern stimulation paradigms were implemented.
   Results: Fifteen articles met our criteria. The majority were small-randomized controlled clinical trials that enrolled a mean of approximately 26 subjects (Phase II studies). Most of the studies (around 83%) assessed the role of tDCS in the treatment of psychiatric conditions, in which the main outcomes were measured by means of behavioral scales and clinical observation, but the diagnostic precision and the quality of outcome monitoring, including adverse events, were deficient by modern standards. Compared to modern tDCS dose, the stimulation intensities used (0.1-1 mA) were lower, however as the electrodes were typically smaller (e.g., 1.26 cm(2)), the average electrode current density (0.2 mA/cm(2)) was approximately 4 x higher. The number of sessions ranged from one to 120 (median 14). Notably, the stimulation session durations of several minutes to 11 h (median 4.5 h) could markedly exceed modern tDCS protocols. Twelve studies out of 15 showed positive results. Only mild side effects were reported, with headache and skin alterations the most common.
   Conclusion: Most of the studies identified were for psychiatric indications, especially in patients with depression and/or schizophrenia and majority indicated some positive results. Variability in outcome is noted across trials and within trials across subjects, but overall results were reported as encouraging, and consistent with modern efforts, given some responders and mild side effects. The significant difference with modern dose, low current with smaller electrode size and interestingly much longer stimulation duration may worth considering.

AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin are associated to a rare form of familiar autosomal recessive Parkinsonism. Despite decades of research on the Parkin protein, whose structure has been recently solved, little is known about the specific signalling pathways that lead to Parkin activation. Parkin activity spans from mitochondria quality control to tumor suppression and stress protection; it is thus tempting to hypothesize that the broad impact of Parkin on cellular physiology might be the result of different post translational modifications that can be controlled by balanced opposing events. Sequence alignment of Parkin from different species indicates high homology between domains across Parkin orthologs and identifies highly conserved amino acid residues that, if modified, impinge on Parkin functions. In this review, we summarize findings on post translational modifications that have been shown to affect Parkin activity and stability.

AB  - Background: Research in emergencies is needed to understand the prevalence of mental health and psychosocial problems and strengthen the evidence base for interventions. All research-including operational needs assessments, programme monitoring and evaluation, and formal academic research-must be conducted ethically. While there is broad consensus on fundamental principles codified in research ethics guidelines, these do not address the ethical specificities of conducting mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) research with adults in emergencies. To address this gap, this paper presents a review of multidisciplinary literature to identify specific ethical principles applicable to MHPSS research in emergencies.
   Discussion: Fifty-nine sources meeting the literature review inclusion criteria were analysed following a thematic synthesis approach. There was consensus on the relevance of universal ethical research principles to MHPSS research in emergencies, including norms of participant informed consent and protection; ensuring benefit arises from research participation; researcher neutrality, accountability, and safety; and the duty to ensure research is well designed and accounts for contextual factors in emergency settings. We go onto discuss unresolved issues by highlighting six current debates relating to the application of ethics in emergency settings: (1) what constitutes fair benefits?; (2) how should informed consent be operationalised?; (3) is there a role for decision making capacity assessments?; (4) how do risk management approaches impact upon the construction of ethical research?; (5) how can ethical reflection best be achieved?, and (6) are ethical review boards sufficiently representative and equipped to judge the ethical and scientific merit of emergency MHPSS research? Underlying these debates is a systemic tension between procedural ethics and ethics in practice.
   Summary and recommendations: In summary, underpinning the literature is a desire to ensure the protection of participants exposed to emergencies and in need of evidence-based MHPSS. However, there is a lack of agreement on how to contextualise guidelines and procedures to effectively maximise the perspectives of researchers, participants and ethical review boards. This is a tension that the field must address to strengthen ethical MHPSS research in emergencies.

AB  - Background: The evidence on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depressive disorder is unclear.
   Methods: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review assessing the effects of SSRIs versus placebo, ` active' placebo, or no intervention in adult participants with major depressive disorder. We searched for eligible randomised clinical trials in The Cochrane Library's CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded, clinical trial registers of Europe and USA, websites of pharmaceutical companies, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency until January 2016. All data were extracted by at least two independent investigators. We used Cochrane systematic review methodology, Trial Sequential Analysis, and calculation of Bayes factor. An eight-step procedure was followed to assess if thresholds for statistical and clinical significance were crossed. Primary outcomes were reduction of depressive symptoms, remission, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were suicides, suicide attempts, suicide ideation, and quality of life.
   Results: A total of 131 randomised placebo-controlled trials enrolling a total of 27,422 participants were included. None of the trials used ` active' placebo or no intervention as control intervention. All trials had high risk of bias. SSRIs significantly reduced the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at end of treatment (mean difference - 1.94 HDRS points; 95% CI -2.50 to -1.37; P < 0.00001; 49 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI -2.70 to -1.18); Bayes factor below predefined threshold (2.01* 10-23). The effect estimate, however, was below our predefined threshold for clinical significance of 3 HDRS points. SSRIs significantly decreased the risk of no remission (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91; P < 0. 00001; 34 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis adjusted CI 0.83 to 0.92); Bayes factor (1426.81) did not confirm the effect). SSRIs significantly increased the risks of serious adverse events (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.75; P = 0.009; 44 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI 1.03 to 1.89). This corresponds to 31/1000 SSRI participants will experience a serious adverse event compared with 22/1000 control participants. SSRIs also significantly increased the number of non-serious adverse events. There were almost no data on suicidal behaviour, quality of life, and long-term effects.
   Conclusions: SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects.

AB  - Although the use of donor sperm as a treatment modality for male infertility has become common place, the health outcomes for those conceived has been poorly studied. A structured search of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Reviews was performed to investigate the health outcomes of offspring conceived from donor sperm. Eight studies were eligible and included in the review, and of these, three were included in a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that donor sperm neonates are not at increased risk of being born of low birth weight (<2500 g), preterm (<37 weeks) or with increased incidences of birth defects, than spontaneously conceived neonates.

AB  - Searching for effective therapeutic agents to prevent neurodegeneration is a challenging task due to the growing list of neurodegenerative disorders associated with a multitude of inter-related pathways. The induction and inhibition of several different signaling pathways has been shown to slow down and/or attenuate neurodegeneration and decline in cognition and locomotor function. Among these signaling pathways, a new class of enzymes known as sirtuins or silent information regulators of gene transcription has been shown to play important regulatory roles in the ageing process. SIRT1, a nuclear sirtuin, has received particular interest due to its role as a deacetylase for several metabolic and signaling proteins involved in stress response, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, self-renewal, and neuroprotection. A new strategy to treat neurodegenerative diseases is targeted therapy. In this paper, we reviewed up-to-date findings regarding the targeting of SIRT1 by polyphenolic compounds, as a new approach in the search for novel, safe and effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - There is not a consensus as to whether neuropsychological profiling can distinguish depressive subtypes. We aimed to systematically review and critically analyse the literature on cognitive function in patients with melancholic and atypical depression. We searched in databases PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Knowledge and PsycInfo for papers comparing the neuropsychological performance of melancholic patients (MEL) to non-melancholic depressive patients (NMEL), including atypical depressives, and healthy controls (HC). All studies were scrutinised to determine the main methodological characteristics and particularly possible sources of bias influencing the results reported, using the STROBE statement checklist. We also provide effect size of the results reported for contrasts between MEL; patients and NMEL patients. Seventeen studies were included; most of them demonstrated higher neuropsychological impairments of MEL patients compared to both NMEL patients and HC on tasks requiring memory, executive function, attention and reaction time. Detailed analysis of the methodologies used in the studies revealed significant variability especially regarding the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of patients and differences in neuropsychological assessment. These findings suggest that MEL may have a distinct and impaired cognitive performance compared to NMEL depressive patients on tasks involving verbal and visual memory, executive function, sustained attention and span, as well as psychomotor speed, this last especially when cognitive load is increased. Additional studies with adequate control of potentially confounding variables will help to clarify further differences in the neuropsychological functioning of depressive subtypes.

AB  - Workplace stress is high among healthcare professionals (HCPs) and is associated with reduced psychological health, quality of care and patient satisfaction. This systematic review and meta-analysis reviews evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for reducing stress in HCPs. A systematic literature search was conducted. Papers were screened for suitability using inclusion criteria and nine papers were subjected to review and quality assessment. Seven papers, for which full statistical findings could be obtained, were also subjected to meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that MBIs have the potential to significantly improve stress among HCPs; however, there was evidence of a file drawer problem. The quality of the studies was high in relation to the clarity of aims, data collection and analysis, but weaker in terms of sample size and the use of theoretical frameworks. MBIs have the potential to reduce stress among HCPs; however, more high-quality research is needed before this finding can be confirmed. Future studies would benefit from long-term follow-up measures to determine any continuing effects of mindfulness training on stress outcomes. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To examine reported outcomes of health services delivered by telehealth to Indigenous Australians. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted to identify articles that reported a telehealth service used to provide clinical services to Indigenous Australians. Articles were screened for inclusion using pre-defined criteria. Findings were synthesised narratively and reported using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: 14 articles, describing 11 distinct telehealth services, were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Authors of included studies report that telehealth has improved social and emotional wellbeing, clinical outcomes and access to health services for Indigenous Australians. Further, it has reduced travel and improved screening rates. Indigenous people report positive perceptions of their telehealth interaction. Conclusion: Telehealth is used to address poor accessibility to health services and for targeted screening programs for at risk populations. Reported outcomes from existing services demonstrate the potential of telehealth for health service delivery for Indigenous Australians. Confidence in the findings of this review is reduced by the predominance of descriptive studies and small sample sizes in many of the included articles. Implications: Telehealth models of care facilitated through partnerships between Aboriginal community-controlled health services and public hospitals may improve both patient outcomes and access to specialist services for Indigenous people.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, the effects of cocaine on the immune system have been subject to research mainly in animals, while relatively little work has been done in humans. This review focuses exclusively on the human work and the related findings in a way that is accessible to neuroscientists. The emerging picture suggests that cocaine may exert some direct effects on lymphocyte responses, as well as, and possibly more importantly, indirect effects via interactions with the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems. Given the pressing need for more effective treatments for cocaine addiction and the high prevalence of medical complications associated with this disorder, this review leaves no doubt that drug addiction merits a place in the growing field of neuropsychoimmunology.

AB  - Antipsychotic polypharmacy in schizophrenia is much debated, since it is common and costly with unclear evidence for its efficacy and safety. We conducted a systematic literature search and a random effects meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing augmentation with a second antipsychotic vs. continued antipsychotic monotherapy in schizophrenia. Co-primary outcomes were total symptom reduction and study-defined response. Antipsychotic augmentation was superior to monotherapy regarding total symptom reduction (16 studies, N=694, standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.53, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.19, p=0.002). However, superiority was only apparent in open-label and low-quality trials (both p<0.001), but not in double-blind and high-quality ones (p=0.120 and 0.226, respectively). Study-defined response was similar between antipsychotic augmentation and monotherapy (14 studies, N=938, risk ratio=1.19, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.42, p=0.061), being clearly non-significant in double-blind and high-quality studies (both p=0.990). Findings were replicated in clozapine and non-clozapine augmentation studies. No differences emerged regarding all-cause/specific-cause discontinuation, global clinical impression, as well as positive, general and depressive symptoms. Negative symptoms improved more with augmentation treatment (18 studies, N=931, SMD=-0.38, 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.13, p<0.003), but only in studies augmenting with aripiprazole (8 studies, N=532, SMD=-0.41, 95% CI: -0.79 to -0.03, p=0.036). Few adverse effect differences emerged: D2 antagonist augmentation was associated with less insomnia (p=0.028), but more prolactin elevation (p=0.015), while aripiprazole augmentation was associated with reduced prolactin levels (p<0.001) and body weight (p=0.030). These data suggest that the common practice of antipsychotic augmentation in schizophrenia lacks double-blind/high-quality evidence for efficacy, except for negative symptom reduction with aripiprazole augmentation.

AB  - With rapid economic development, China has been plagued by choking air pollution in recent years, and the frequent occurrence of haze episodes has caused widespread public concern. The purpose of this study is to describe the sources and formation of haze, summarize the mitigation measures in force, review the relationship between haze pollution and public health, and to discuss the challenges, potential research directions and policy options. Haze pollution has both natural and man-made causes, though it is anthropogenic sources that are the major contributors. Accumulation of air pollutants, secondary formation of aerosols, stagnant meteorological conditions, and trans-boundary transportation of pollutants are the principal causes driving the formation and evolution of haze. In China, haze includes gaseous pollutants and fine particles, of which PM2.5 is the dominant component. Short and long-term exposure to haze pollution are associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, mental health problems, lung cancer and premature death. China has paid increasing attention to the improvement of air quality, and has introduced action plans and policies to tackle pollution, but many interventions have only temporary effects. There may be fierce resistance from industry groups and some government agencies, and often it is challenging to enforce relevant control measures and laws. We discuss the potential policy options for prevention, the need for wider public dialogue and the implications for scientific research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - CHILD
AB  - Introduction: Studies about mental disorders are very rare in the Northeast of Brazil, especially when psychopathologies in children and adolescents are considered. The consequence is a small availability of data and an absence of a real epidemiological profile.
   Methods: This is a systematic review with meta-analysis, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, in the period from 2003 to 2015, using the databases LILACS, SciELO and BVS. The analysis comprised the keywords models of primary and secondary healthcare in mental health', psychiatric reform' and policies and services in mental health', using the Boolean operator # AND'. Original texts based on secondary data from the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified Health System were also included via the Citizen Electronic Record System, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica, and Ministry of Health. Grey literature was used by means of hand searching.
   Results: A combined analysis of the strategies mentioned in the analyzed articles shows a combined odds ratio of 1.291 (confidence interval (CI)=1.054-1.582), thus it demonstrates the efficacy of using such strategies in the elaboration of institutional apparatus in mental health. The p-value of the chi-square distribution resulted in .9753, which does not reject the hypothesis of association between strategies in mental health and possible development of institutional apparatus in mental health.
   Conclusions: A combined analysis of all strategies mentioned in the analyzed studies shows efficacy of using strategies to elaborate institutional apparatus in mental health.

AB  - Background: Abuse of vulnerable adults in institutional settings has been reported from various countries; however, there has been no systematic review of the characteristics of the victims and their abusers. Our aim was to identify and synthesise the literature on victims, perpetrators and institutions where abuse occured in order to inform interventions to prevent such abuse.
   Methods: Searches of MEDLINE (OVID), CINHAL (EBSCO), EMBASE (OVID) and PsychINFO (OVID) databases identified 4279 references. After screening of titles and abstracts, 123 citations merited closer inspection. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 articles were included in the review.
   Results: Our review suggested that the evidence available on risk factors is not extensive but some conclusions can be drawn. Clients, staff, institutional and environmental factors appear to play a role in increasing the risk of abuse.
   Conclusions: Vulnerable clients need closer monitoring. Clients and staff may lack the awareness and knowledge to identify and report abuse. Institutions should take proactive steps to monitor clients, train staff and devise systems that allow for the identification and prevention of incidents of abuse.There is a need for further research into the associations between the individual client, staff, institutional characteristics and abuse.

AB  - Deficits in facial emotion recognition in Huntington's disease (HD) have been extensively researched, however, a theory-based integration of these deficits into the broader picture of emotion processing is lacking. To describe the full extent of emotion processing deficits we reviewed the clinical research literature in HD, including a consideration of research in Parkinson's disease, guided by a theoretical model on emotion processing, the Component Process Model. Further, to contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying deficient emotion recognition, we discussed the literature in light of specific emotion recognition theories. Current evidence from HD studies indicates deficits in the production of emotional facial expressions and alterations in subjective emotional experiences, in addition to emotion recognition deficits. Conceptual understanding of emotions remains relatively intact. Impaired recognition and expression of emotion in HD might be linked, whereas altered emotional experiences appear to be unrelated to emotion recognition. A key implication of this review is the need to take all the components of emotion processing into account to understand specific deficits in neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well known progressive neurodegenerative disorder having complex pathophysiology. Currently, drugs that are used symptomatically in the treatment of AD include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) (rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine). Limited bioavailability of these drugs stresses continuity of search for novel therapeutics for this slow growing but complex disease. Herbal drugs are being used to treat memory related problems, including Alzheimer's from time immemorial. Both preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic potential of herbal drugs for the prevention of AD. Herbal drugs have been shown to be effective against Alzheimer's possibly due to their pleiotropic and multifaceted action that includes antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of herbal drugs for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) as an environmental pollutant is suspected to be associated with autism spectrum disorders. The aim of the present study was to review the epidemiological literature currently available on the relation between PM exposure and diagnosis of ASD. The PubMed database was searched from November 2015 up to January 2016 by one of the authors. We included observational studies (cohort and case control studies) published in English carried out in children within the last 10 years, measuring PM exposure and health outcomes related to ASD. 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Four of the studies found no association between PM exposure and ASD. The other 8 studies show positive associations restricted to specific exposure windows which however do not reach statistical significance at times. To conclude, the evidence from the studies allows us to conclude that there is an association between PM exposure and ASD whose strength varies according to the particle size studied with the association with PM2.5 and diesel PM being stronger. Given the potential importance for public health, cohort studies with proper adjustment for confounding variables and identification of critical windows of exposure are urgently needed to further improve knowledge about potential causal links between PM exposure and the development of ASD.

AB  - One in six patients admitted for stroke was previously demented. These patients have less access to appropriate stroke care, although little is known about their optimal management. Objective: To determine how pre-stroke cognitive impairment can be detected, its mechanism, and influence on outcome and management. Methods: Literature search. Results: (i) A systematic approach with the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly is recommended; (ii) Pre-stroke cognitive impairment may be due to brain lesions of vascular, degenerative, or mixed origin; (iii) Patients with pre-stroke dementia, have worse outcomes, more seizures, delirium, and depression, and higher mortality rates; they often need to be institutionalised after their stroke; (iv) Although the safety profile of treatment is not as good as that of cognitively normal patients, the risk: benefit ratio is in favour of treating these patients like others. Conclusion: Patients with cognitive impairment who develop a stroke have worse outcomes, but should be treated like others.

AB  - Diverse industries like detergents, resins and polymers, hair dyes, intravaginal spermicides, and pesticides produce endocrine disruptor (ED)-containing wastewaters that have hazardous effects on the environment and public health. Nonylphenol (NP) is a chemical substance that consists of a phenolic group and an attached lipophilic linear nonyl chain. NP has weak estrogenic activity and affects estrogen receptor (ER), as well as induces male infertility via a negative impact on spermatogenesis and sperm quality. The aim of this study was to comprehensively review all available literature about the side effects of NP on the male genital system. We systematically searched Scopus and PubMed using MeSH terms that include "Organic Chemicals," "Infertility," "Infertility, Male," "Nonylphenol", ("Infertility, Male"[Mesh]) OR "Nonylphenol" [Supplementary Concept]) OR " Prostate"[Mesh]) OR "Spermatozoa"[Mesh]) OR "Sertoli Cells"[Mesh]) OR "Leydig Cells"[Mesh] OR "Male accessory gland" OR "Epididym" OR "Reproductive toxicity"), and all other possible combinations from January 1, 1970, to September 15, 2016, with language limit. The initial search identified 117,742 potentially eligible studies, of which 33 met the established inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Thirty-three selected studies include animal model (n = 18), cell line (n = 15), human model (n = 1), morphology (n = 13), sperm quality (n = 17), and toxicity (n = 14). This review highlighted the evidence for the ED effect of NP that acts through interference with ER, discussing male reproductive tract perturbations. We critically discuss the available evidence on the effect of NP on sperm quality (such as motility, viability, sperm count, and sperm concentration), dramatic morphological changes (such as change of weights of testes and epididymis), and biochemical changes related to oxidative stress in testes. Finally, it is important to take caution with the continued use of NP that disrupts male reproductive health.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a main role in the development of diabetes complications. The impairment of gonadal antioxidant potential and endocrine disturbance in diabetic males causes testicular damage and failure in sperm production. Plants have been widely used to control diabetes due their hypoglycemic and antioxidant potential, contributing towards the recovery of testicular function. Current study comprises a review of the literature on the main medicinal plants used in the recovery of testicular oxidative damage in animals with experimental diabetes. Eighteen plant species in the nineteen studies selected from the search strategy were evaluated. Plant extracts were evaluated according to their effects on blood glucose and insulin levels, antioxidant enzymes and oxidant levels, lipid peroxidation, total protein, testosterone levels, gonadosomatic index, diameter of seminiferous tubules, seminiferous epithelium height and integrity, number of germ cells at stage VII and apoptosis in the seminiferous epithelium, sperm production, motility, viability and morphology. After the analysis of the studies, it was observed that plant species, used alone or in combination, may control testicular oxidative damage triggered by diabetes. The antioxidant potential varies among species, with some plants proving to have a better performance in the recovery of reproduction parameters than others.

AB  - Background: Epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene expression not involving changes in DNA sequence and is presently an active area of research in biology and medicine. There is increasing evidence that epigenetics is involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.
   Aims and Methods: Several studies conducted to date have suggested that psychosocial factors act by modifying epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression in the brain in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Such studies have been conducted both on brain tissues and also using peripheral tissues as substitutes for brain tissues. This article reviews such studies.
   Results and Conclusion: Epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression in the brain appear to link one individual with another in the context of social psychiatry. Epigenetics appears to be of major importance to the field of social psychiatry.

AB  - Objective: Although a minority of persons with schizophrenia (SCZ) commits violent acts, SCZ remains a risk factor for violence. Here, we present a broad overview of evidence-based treatments for violence in SCZ, including biological and psychosocial interventions.
   Method: We conducted MEDLINE and PsychINFO literature searches to retrieve articles relating to treatments for violent, hostile, or aggressive behaviours in SCZ.
   Results: Clozapine shows the strongest evidence for treating the acute violence of SCZ. Other atypical antipsychotics also possess antiaggressive effects, although the evidence is not as robust as that for clozapine. Psychosocial treatments can be useful adjuncts to pharmacotherapy once patients' positive symptoms have stabilized. Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis and cognitive remediation are 2 psychosocial interventions that have demonstrated positive outcomes for violence in SCZ. Most psychosocial studies that examined violence as an outcome were conducted in forensic psychiatric settings.
   Conclusions: Effective treatments exist for persons with SCZ who pose a risk for violent and aggressive behaviour, although the overall evidence base remains relatively weak. More randomized controlled trials of programs showing evidence for reduction of violence in SCZ are required. Further research should delineate which patients could benefit from multimodal treatment and where and when such treatments are optimally delivered.

AB  - Intracellular alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-rich protein aggregates called Lewy pathology (LP) and neuronal death are commonly found in the brains of patients with clinical Parkinson disease (cPD). It is widely believed that LP appears early in the disease and spreads in synaptically coupled brain networks, driving neuronal dysfunction and death. However, post-mortem analysis of human brains and connectome-mapping studies show that the pattern of LP in cPD is not consistent with this simple model, arguing that, if LP propagates in cPD, it must be gated by cell or region-autonomous mechanisms. Moreover, the correlation between LP and neuronal death is weak. In this Review, we briefly discuss the evidence for and against the spreading LP model, as well as evidence that cell-autonomous factors govern both a-syn pathology and neuronal death.

AB  - Objective: Involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC)also referred to as 'assisted outpatient treatment' or 'community treatment orders' are civil court orders whereby persons with serious mental illness and repeated hospitalisations are ordered to adhere to community-based treatment. Increasingly, in the United States, OPC is promoted to policy makers as a means to prevent violence committed by persons with mental illness. This article reviews the background and context for promotion of OPC for violence prevention and the empirical evidence for the use of OPC for this goal.
   Method: Relevant publications were identified for review in PubMed, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, personal communications, and relevant Internet searches of advocacy and policy-related publications.
   Results: Most research on OPC has focussed on outcomes such as community functioning and hospital recidivism and not on interpersonal violence. As a result, research on violence towards others has been limited but suggests that low-level acts of interpersonal violence such as minor, noninjurious altercations without weapon use and arrests can be reduced by OPC, but there is no evidence that OPC can reduce major acts of violence resulting in injury or weapon use. The impact of OPC on major violence, including mass shootings, is difficult to assess because of their low base rates.
   Conclusions: Effective implementation of OPC, when combined with intensive community services and applied for an adequate duration to take effect, can improve treatment adherence and related outcomes, but its promise as an effective means to reduce serious acts of violence is unknown.

AB  - Background
   Nutrition interventions would appear fundamental for weight management and cardiometabolic risk reduction in people experiencing severe mental illness (SMI). Comprehensive evaluation of nutrition interventions is lacking.
   Aims
   To subject randomised controlled trials of nutrition interventions in people with SMI to systematic review and meta-analysis, and to measure anthropometric and biochemical parameters and nutritional intake.
   Method
   An electronic database search identified trials with nutrition intervention components. Trials were pooled for meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were performed on anthropometric moderators.
   Results
   Interventions led to significant weight loss (19 studies), reduced body mass index (17 studies), decreased waist circumference (10 studies) and lower blood glucose levels (5 studies). Dietitian-led interventions (6 studies) and studies delivered at antipsychotic initiation (4 studies) had larger effect sizes.
   Conclusions
   Evidence supports nutrition interventions as standard care in preventing and treating weight gain among people experiencing SMI.

AB  - One especially important feature of metrical music is that it contains periodicities that listeners' bodily rhythms can adapt to. Recent psychological frameworks have introduced the notion of rhythmic entrainment, among other mechanisms, as an emotion induction principle. In this review paper, we discuss rhythmic entrainment as an affect induction mechanism by differentiating four levels of entrainment in humans perceptual, autonomic physiological, motor, and social all of which could contribute to a subjective feeling component. We review the theoretical and empirical literature on rhythmic entrainment to music that supports the existence of these different levels of entrainment by describing the phenomena and characterizing the associated underlying brain processes. The goal of this review is to present the theoretical implications and empirical findings about rhythmic entrainment as an important principle at the basis of affect induction via music, since it rests upon the temporal dimension of music, which is a specificity of music as an affective stimulus.

AB  - Background: The impact of unemployment and precarious employment on the health of young people is not well understood. However, according to social causation, higher socio-economic positions and thus better working conditions are beneficial to health in general. We tried to synthesize the results of studies that test this hypothesis in the case of young people. Methods: We conducted a scoping study mapping all the academic articles published in the period 2006-2016 in Europe. The literature was searched in PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus. Results: We identified 1770 studies, of which only 46 met the inclusion criteria. There are more studies that focus on the relationship between unemployment and health than between precarious employment and health (28 and 16, respectively). The vast majority of the studies (44) found support for the social causation hypothesis, the most common health outcomes being mental health disorders, health risk behaviour, poor quality of life and occupational injuries. The causal mechanisms behind this association relied mainly on the life-course perspective, the breadwinner model, and the lack of social and economic benefits provided by standard employment. Conclusions:There is evidence that young people are especially vulnerable to health problems when unemployed or working in precarious conditions. Active labour market and training programmes, inclusive social security measures, improved working conditions and targeted health programmes are important for addressing this vulnerability. Further research should strive to enhance the causal model by including a gender perspective, longitudinal data, more indicators on precariousness and third factor explanations.

AB  - Converging evidence from genetic, pathological and experimental studies have increasingly suggested an important role for autophagy impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Genetic studies have identified mutations in genes encoding for components of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), including glucosidase beta acid 1 (GBA1), that are associated with increased risk for developing PD. Observations in PD brain tissue suggest an aberrant regulation of autophagy associated with the aggregation of a-synuclein (a-syn). As autophagy is one of the main systems involved in the proteolytic degradation of a-syn, pharmacological enhancement of autophagy may be an attractive strategy to combat a-syn aggregation in PD. Here, we review the potential of autophagy enhancement as disease-modifying therapy in PD based on preclinical evidence. In particular, we provide an overview of the molecular regulation of autophagy and targets for pharmacological modulation within the ALP. In experimental models, beneficial effects on multiple pathological processes involved in PD, including a-syn aggregation, cell death, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, have been demonstrated using the autophagy enhancers rapamycin and lithium. However, selectivity of these agents is limited, while upstream ALP signaling proteins are involved in many other pathways than autophagy. Broad stimulation of autophagy may therefore cause a wide spectrum of dose-dependent side-effects, suggesting that its clinical applicability is limited. However, recently developed agents selectively targeting core ALP components, including Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), lysosomes, GCase as well as chaperone-mediated autophagy regulators, exert more specific effects on molecular pathogenetic processes causing PD. To conclude, the targeted manipulation of downstream ALP components, rather than broad autophagy stimulation, may be an attractive strategy for the development of novel pharmacological therapies in PD. Further characterization of dysfunctional autophagy in different stages and molecular subtypes of PD in combination with the clinical translation of downstream autophagy regulation offers exciting new avenues for future drug development.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is now considered to be a multisystemic disorder consequent on multineuropeptide dysfunction including dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic systems. This multipeptide dysfunction leads to expression of a range of non-motor symptoms now known to be integral to the concept of PD and preceding the diagnosis of motor PD. Some non-motor symptoms in PD may have a dopaminergic basis and in this review, we investigate the evidence for this based on imaging techniques using dopamine-based radioligands. To discuss non-motor symptoms we follow the classification as outlined by the validated PD non-motor symptoms scale.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating and highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease for which only symptomatic treatment is available. In order to develop a truly effective disease-modifying therapy, improvement of our current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis and progression is crucial. For this purpose, standardization of research protocols and disease models is necessary. As human dopaminergic neurons, the cells mainly affected in PD, are difficult to obtain and maintain as primary cells, current PD research is mostly performed with permanently established neuronal cell models, in particular the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y lineage. This cell line is frequently chosen because of its human origin, catecholaminergic (though not strictly dopaminergic) neuronal properties, and ease of maintenance. However, there is no consensus on many fundamental aspects that are associated with its use, such as the effects of culture media composition and of variations in differentiation protocols. Here we present the outcome of a systematic review of scientific articles that have used SH-SY5Y cells to explore PD. We describe the cell source, culture conditions, differentiation protocols, methods/approaches used to mimic PD and the preclinical validation of the SH-SY5Y findings by employing alternative cellular and animal models. Thus, this overview may help to standardize the use of the SH-SY5Y cell line in PD research and serve as a future user's guide.

AB  - Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of and may play a central role in the neurotoxicity in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, inhibiting aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein, has been a main therapeutic target for these disorders. Among various strategies, amyloid beta immunotherapy has been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease, followed by similar studies of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid beta monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is expected that further refinement of immunotherapy against neurodegenerative diseases may lead to increasing efficacy. Meanwhile, type II diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction and abnormalities surrounding insulin signaling may underlie disease progression. Naturally, "anti-insulin resistance" therapy has emerged as a novel paradigm in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, incretin agonists, which stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppress Parkinson's disease disease progression in clinical trials. Similar studies are ongoing also in Alzheimer's disease. This paper focuses on critical issues in "immunotherapy" and "antiinsulin resistance" therapy in relation to therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative disease, and more importantly, how they might merge mechanistically at the point of suppression of protein aggregation, raising the possibility that combined immunotherapy and "anti-insulin resistance" therapy may be superior to either monotherapy.

AB  - Metal ions are key elements in organisms' life acting like cofactors of many enzymes but they can also be potentially dangerous for the cell participating in redox reactions that lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Any factor inducing or limiting a metal dyshomeostasis, ROS production and cell injury may contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases or play a neuroprotective action. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system (ONS) of human and other mammalian species. The causative agent of TSEs is believed to be the scrapie prion protein PrPsc, the beta sheet-rich pathogenic isoform produced by the conformational conversion of the alpha-helix-rich physiological isoform PrPC. The peculiarity of PrPSC is its ability to self-propagate in exponential fashion in cells and its tendency to precipitate in insoluble and protease-resistance amyloid aggregates leading to neuronal cell death. The expression "prion-like diseases" refers to a group of neurodegenerative diseases that share some neuropathological features with prion diseases such as the involvement of proteins (alpha-synuclein, amyloid and tau) able to precipitate producing amyloid deposits following conformational change. High social impact diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's belong to prion-like diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that the exposure to environmental metals is a risk factor for the development of prion and prion-like diseases and that metal ions can directly bind to prion and prion-like proteins affecting the amount of amyloid aggregates. The diet, source of metal ions but also of natural antioxidant and chelating agents such as polyphenols, is an aspect to take into account in addressing the issue of neurodegeneration. Epidemiological data suggest that the Mediterranean diet, based on the abundant consumption of fresh vegetables and on low intake of meat, could play a preventive or delaying role in prion and prion-like neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, metal role in the onset of prion and prion-like diseases is dealt with from a nutritional, cellular, and molecular point of view.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a common denominator in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in ischemic and traumatic brain injury. The brain is highly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to its high metabolic demand. However, therapies attempting to scavenge free radicals have shown little success. By shifting the focus to inhibit the generation of damaging free radicals, recent studies have identified NADPH oxidase as a major contributor to disease pathology. NADPH oxidase has the primary function to generate free radicals. In particular, there is growing evidence that the isoforms NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 can be upregulated by a variety of neurodegenerative factors. The majority of recent studies have shown that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase enzymes are neuroprotective and able to reduce detrimental aspects of pathology following ischemic and traumatic brain injury, as well as in chronic neurodegenerative disorders. This review aims to summarize evidence supporting the role of NADPH oxidase in the pathology of these neurological disorders, explores pharmacological strategies of targeting this major oxidative stress pathway, and outlines obstacles that need to be overcome for successful translation of these therapies to the clinic.

AB  - In this article, we describe the history and current state of psychosomatic medicine (PSM) in Japan and propose measures that could be considered based on our view of the future prospects of PSM in Japan. The Japanese Society of PSM (JSPM) was established in 1959, and the first Department of Psychosomatic Internal Medicine in Japan was established at Kyushu University In 1963. PSM in Japan has shown a prominent, unique development, with 3,300 members (as of March 2016), comprised of 71.6% of medical doctors including psychosomatic internal medicine (PIM) specialists, general internists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecologists, dentists, dermatologists, and others. Most of the non-physician members include psychology and nursing staff specialists. The Japanese Society of Psychosomatic Internal Medicine (JSPIM), founded in 1996, is another major society with more than 1,200 physicians that is mainly composed of internists. The first joint congress of the five major PSM societies from each field was held in 2009. They included the Japanese Society of Psychosomatic Medicine, Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology, Psychosomatic Pediatric Medicine, Psychosomatic Dental Medicine, and Psychosomatic Internal Medicine. Several subdivided societies in related medical fields have also been established for cardiovascular, digestive, dermatological, and oriental medicine and for eating disorders, pain, fibromyalgia, stress science, behavioral medicine, and psycho-oncology. JSPM and JSPIM participate in international activities including publishing BioPsychoSocial Medicine (BPSM) and the establishment of a sister society relationship with the Germany College of PSM. PSM in Japan has adopted a variety of professional psychotherapies, including transactional analysis, autogenic therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Mutual interrelationship has been promoted by the Japanese Union of Associations for Psycho-medical Therapy (UPM).
   Although PSM in Japan is functioning at a high level, there remain areas that could be improved. Among the 81 medical schools in Japan, just eight university hospitals have an independent department of PSM and of 29 dental schools only three dental university hospitals have a department of psychosomatic dentistry. Further accumulation of evidence regarding the mind-body relationship in clinical and basic science that is based on the latest advanced technology is necessary. The psychosomatic medicine community needs to make an even greater contribution to meeting the needs of modern society. The possibilities for the future development of PSM in Japan must be widely discussed.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAPDH) oxidase (NOX) is an enzyme complex with the sole function of producing superoxide anion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the expense of NADPH. Vital to the immune system as well as cellular signaling, NOX is also involved in the pathologies of a wide variety of disease states. Particularly, it is an integral player in many neurological diseases, including stroke, TBI, and neurodegenerative diseases. Pathologically, NOX produces an excessive amount of ROS that exceed the bodys antioxidant ability to neutralize them, leading to oxidative stress and aberrant signaling. This prevalence makes it an attractive therapeutic target and as such, NOX inhibitors have been studied and developed to counter NOXs deleterious effects. However, recent studies of NOX have created a better understanding of the NOX complex. Comprised of independent cytosolic subunits, p47-phox, p67-phox, p40-phox and Rac, and membrane subunits, gp91-phox and p22-phox, the NOX complex requires a unique activation process through subunit interaction. Of these subunits, p47-phox plays the most important role in activation, binding and translocating the cytosolic subunits to the membrane and anchoring to p22-phox to organize the complex for NOX activation and function. Moreover, these interactions, particularly that between p47-phox and p22-phox, are dependent on phosphorylation initiated by upstream processes involving protein kinase C (PKC). This review will look at these interactions between subunits and with PKC. It will focus on the interaction involving p47-phox with p22-phox, key in bringing the cytosolic subunits to the membrane. Furthermore, the implication of these interactions as a target for NOX inhibitors such as apocynin will be discussed as a potential avenue for further investigation, in order to develop more specific NOX inhibitors based on the inhibition of NOX assembly and activation.

AB  - The inflammatory responses of resident central nervous system (CNS) cells are now known to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of an array of infectious and sterile neuroinflammatory disorders such as meningitis, encephalitis, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease and multiple sclerosis (MS). Regulating glial inflammatory responses in a timely manner is therefore critical in preserving normal CNS functions. The neuropeptide substance P is produced at high levels within the CNS and its selective receptor, the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R), is abundantly expressed by neurons and is present on glial cell types including microglia and astrocytes. In addition to its functions as a neurotransmitter in the perception of pain and its essential role in gut motility, this tachykinin is widely recognized to exacerbate inflammation at peripheral sites including the skin, gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. Recently, a number of studies have identified a role for substance P and NK-1R interactions in neuroinflammation and described the ability of this neuropeptide to alter the immune functions of activated microglia and astrocytes. In this review article, we describe the expression of substance P and its receptor by resident CNS cells, and we discuss the ability of this neuropeptide to exacerbate the inflammatory responses of glia and immune cells that are recruited to the brain during neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we discuss the available data indicating that the NK-1R-mediated augmentation of such responses appears to be detrimental during microbial infection and some sterile neurodegenerative disorders, and propose the repurposed use of NK-1R antagonists, of a type that are currently approved as anti-emetic and anti-anxiolytic agents, as an adjunct therapy to ameliorate the inflammatory CNS damage in these conditions.

AB  - There is a growing recognition that positive psychological functioning (which includes constructs such as optimism and hope) influences health. However, the understanding of these underlying mechanisms in relation to health is limited. Therefore, this review sought to identify what the scientific literature says about the influence of optimism and hope on chronic disease treatment. A search was conducted in the PsycINFO, Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases using the indexing terms optimism, hope, chronic diseases, randomized controlled trial, and treatment between 1998 and 2015. In the articles, we identified the most studied diseases in context, the assessment instruments used, the participant characteristics investigated, the results found, and the publication dates. From our analysis of the articles that met our inclusion criteria, it appears that the study of these constructs is recent and there is evidence that individuals with greater optimism and hope seek to engage in healthier behaviors, regardless of their clinical status, and that this contributes to chronic disease treatment. More research is needed so that targeted interventions can be carried out effectively in chronic disease treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Although there has been a great deal of concern about the consequences of unintended pregnancies on child health, there has been little documented evidence across specific outcomes to inform programs and policies. This paper highlights the association between unintended pregnancy, and its health and developmental consequences to children.
   Methods: Published and grey evidence available adverse effects of unintended pregnancy on children were extracted electronically using search engines: PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar for the period January 1981 through January 2017. The PRISMA checklist was used and qualities of eligible studies were assessed for method validity and result interpretation. Effect-size odds ratioswere calculated from extracted data.
   Results: Of the 107 studies identified after removal of duplications, 29 studies with a quality score ranging from 3 to 6 (Mean = 5.65; SD +/- 0.65) were included. Pattern of child rearing, development and health were found to differ for children classified to be breads of an unintended pregnancy. However, many of the available studies appear to have methodological limitations such as recall bias and brief period of follow-ups limiting causal inferences and to determine a temporal sequence. The findings were found to be inconsistent across studies.
   Conclusion: Studies provide evidence relating to adverse health outcomes for children of unintended births. The existing knowledge is limited by weak research methodologies and a paucity of studies addressing subsequent health and developmental effects beyond the early childhood period. There is a need for more multi-wave longitudinal studies to assess child health and developmental trajectories associated with unintended pregnancies.

AB  - Background: Terrorism-related deaths are at an all-time high as there were 32,685 and 29,376 terrorism-related deaths in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism is detrimental for mental health, premature mortality, and economic losses and undermines the central tenets of public health to improve the health and well-being of populations. Despite the impact terrorism has on avoidable morbidity and mortality, population health research largely overlooks social determinants of terrorism and risk factors that contribute to terrorist activities. Methods: Drawing from what is known about commonly studied social determinants of health topics, including the relationships between structural and interpersonal discrimination, social cohesion, and gang violence and health, we present a public health framework, rooted in the social determinants of health, for identifying potential factors influencing terrorism and violent radicalization. Results: Social determinants of health provide unique insight into how interpersonal and structural factors can influence risk for violent radicalization and terrorist activity. Each of the topics we review provides an entry point for existing public health and behavioral science knowledge to be used in preventing and understanding violent radicalization and terrorism. For example, anti-Muslim sentiment has promoted discrimination against Muslims, while also serving to marginalize and stigmatize Muslim communities. These conditions limit the social resources, like social cohesion, that Muslims have access to and make political violence more appealing to some. Conclusions: Public health can contribute much to the ongoing debate around terrorism. The field must take a more prevention-focused approach to the problem of terrorism. Failure to do so only perpetuates approaches that have not been successful.

AB  - The use of vacuum glazed windows is increasing due to their application in modern building design. Among various types of vacuum glazed windows reported in literature, thermal transmittance of single glass sheet (conventional window) i. e 6 W/m(2)k is reduced by 66 and 77% using air filled double glazed and air filled triple glazed windows, respectively. Using low emittance coatings thermal transmittance of double glazed windows is reduced by 53%, however it offsets the visibility by reducing light transmittance by 5%. Stresses due to temperature/pressure gradients if not eliminated may lead to reduction in service life of vacuum glazed windows. Vacuum created between the glass sheets is used to reduce conductive heat transfer. Degradation in the vacuum is caused by number of factors such as, permeation of gaseous molecules through glass sheets, leakage through sealing, thermal/optical desorption, and photo-fragmentation of organic species have been critically reviewed and future trends are outlined.

AB  - Norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus modulates cellular processes and synaptic transmission in the central nervous system through its actions at a number of pre- and postsynaptic receptors. This transmitter system facilitates sensory signal detection and promotes waking and arousal, processes which are necessary for navigating a complex and dynamic sensory environment. In addition to its effects on sensory processing and waking behavior, norepinephrine is now recognized as a contributor to various aspects of cognition, including attention, behavioral flexibility, working memory, and long-term mnemonic processes. Two areas of dense noradrenergic innervation, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, are particularly important with regard to these functions. Due to its role in mediating normal cognitive function, it is reasonable to expect that noradrenergic transmission becomes dysfunctional in a number of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cognitive deficits. In this review, we summarize the unique role that norepinephrine plays in prefrontal cortical and hippocampal function and how its interaction with its various receptors contribute to cognitive behaviors. We further assess the changes that occur in the noradrenergic system in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia and how these changes contribute to cognitive decline in these pathologies.

AB  - Although the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood, oxidative stress has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, multifaceted and divergent signaling cascades downstream of oxidative stress have posed challenges for researchers to identify a central component of the oxidative stress-induced pathways causing neurodegeneration in PD. Since 2010, c-Abl-a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and an indicator of oxidative stress-has shown remarkable potential as a future promising drug target in PD therapeutics. Although, the constitutively active form of c-Abl, Bcr-Abl, has a long history in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, the role of c-Abl in PD and relevant neurodegenerative diseases was completely unknown. Recently, others and we have identified and validated c-Abl as an important pathogenic mediator of the disease, where activated c-Abl emerges as a common link to various PD-related inducers of oxidative stress relevant to both sporadic and familial forms of PD and alpha-synucleinopathies. This review discusses the role of c-Abl in PD and the latest advancement on c-Abl as a drug target and as a prospective biomarker.

AB  - Background: Fibromyalgia is a painful chronic disease, suffered mainly by women, that consolidates a number of symptoms and skeletal muscle issues which are little understood.
   Objectives: To explore the social construction of FM from the perspective of health policies, patients, and health professionals involved in their medical attention.
   Methods: I) Policy review of national and regional health plans in a national and international context, the clinical protocols for fibromyalgia in Spain, and the Parliamentary initials in the European and Spanish context; and ii) Qualitative study involving 28 personal interviews with 16 fibromyalgia patients and 12 interviews with health care professionals in Spain.
   Results: The findings show that in Spain, the fact that fibromyalgia lacks recognition still remains: in policies, in the clinical and professional fields, and in the patients' social circle. International health policy has not yet taken steps to reflect the emergence of this recently diagnosed disease. The care for patients suffering from fibromyalgia, who are mainly women, leads to frustration among the healthcare professionals and desperation among the patients themselves, as a resolutive treatment for the disease is not existing. Patients show resistance at assuming the sick role. They want to carry on undertaking their daily activities, both in the public sphere and in the private one. Roles involving the gendered division of labour were found to follow a rigid pattern, both prior to and subsequent to the disease, as the causes that led to frustration for men or women differ according to activities that are socially assigned to them. In practice, FM is conceived exclusively as a women's health problem, which may result in a gender-biased patient healthcare attention.
   Conclusion: Political, professional and individual spheres have an influence on how this disease is constructed on a social level: as one of the "invisible women's diseases". It is recommended to resolve the disease's lack of recognition by i) implementing specific policies for FM and ii) increasing the training and sensitization of health providers about the severity of FM and the existence of gender prejudices biasing the attention.

AB  - In movies, robots are often extremely humanlike. Although these robots are not yet reality, robots are currently being used in healthcare, education, and business. Robots provide benefits such as relieving loneliness and enabling communication. Engineers are trying to build robots that look and behave like humans and thus need comprehensive knowledge not only of technology but also of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. This need is driving engineers to study human behavior toward other humans and toward robots, leading to greater understanding of how humans think, feel, and behave in these contexts, including our tendencies for mindless social behaviors, anthropomorphism, uncanny feelings toward robots, and the formation of emotional attachments. However, in considering the increased use of robots, many people have concerns about deception, privacy, job loss, safety, and the loss of human relationships. Human-robot interaction is a fascinating field and one in which psychologists have much to contribute, both to the development of robots and to the study of human behavior.

AB  - Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplantation. When oxygen is reintroduced to the liver graft it initiates a cascade of molecular reactions leading to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These soluble mediators propagate a sterile immune response to cause significant tissue damage. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is one method that reduces hepatocellular injury by altering the immune response and inhibiting the production of ROS. Studies quantifying the effects of IPC in humans have demonstrated an improved liver enzyme panel in patients receiving grafts pretreated with IPC as compared to patients receiving the standard of care. In our review, we explore current literature in the field in order to describe the mechanism through which IPC regulates the production of ROS and improves IR injury.

AB  - Health interventions delivered by peer specialists or co-facilitated by peer specialists and health professionals can help improve the physical health of people with serious mental illness (SMI). Yet, the quality of the studies examining these health interventions and their impact on health outcomes remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of peer-based health interventions for people with SMI. We rated the methodological quality of studies, summarized intervention strategies and health outcomes, and evaluated the inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities in these studies. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines to conduct our systematic literature review. Electronic bibliographic databases and manual searches were used to locate articles that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and 2015, described peer-based health interventions for people with SMI, and evaluated the impact of the interventions on physical health outcomes. Two independent reviewers used a standardized instrument to rate studies' methodological quality, abstracted study characteristics, and evaluated the effects of the interventions on different health outcomes. Eighteen articles were reviewed. Findings indicated that the strength of the evidence generated from these studies is limited due to several methodological limitations. Mixed and limited intervention effects were reported for most health outcomes. The most promising interventions were self-management and peer-navigator interventions. Efforts to strengthen the evidence of peer-based interventions require a research agenda that focuses on establishing the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions across different populations and settings.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by brain deposition of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles along with steady cognitive decline. Synaptic damage, an early pathological event, correlates strongly with cognitive deficits and memory loss. Mitochondria are essential organelles for synaptic function. Neurons utilize specialized mechanisms to drive mitochondrial trafficking to synapses in which mitochondria buffer Ca2+ and serve as local energy sources by supplying ATP to sustain neurotransmitter release. Mitochondrial abnormalities are one of the earliest and prominent features in AD patient brains. Amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau both trigger mitochondrial alterations. Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial perturbation acts as a key factor that is involved in synaptic failure and degeneration in AD. The importance of mitochondria in supporting synaptic function has made them a promising target of new therapeutic strategies for AD. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial function at synapses, highlight recent findings on the disturbance of mitochondrial dynamics and transport in AD, and discuss how these alterations impact synaptic vesicle release and thus contribute to synaptic pathology associated with AD.

AB  - This article discusses recent evidence supporting the use of action observation therapy and motor imagery practice for rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease. A main question that emerges from the review regards the different effectiveness of these approaches and the possibility of integrating them into a single method to enhance motor behaviour in subjects with Parkinson's disease. In particular, the reviewed studies suggest that action observation therapy can have a positive effect on motor facilitation of patients and that a long-term rehabilitation program based on action observation therapy or motor imagery practice can bring some benefit on their motor recovery. Moreover, the paper discusses how the research on the combined use of action observation and motor imagery for motor improvements in healthy subjects may encourage the combined use of action observation therapy and motor imagery practice for therapeutic aims in Parkinson's disease. To date, this hypothesis has never been experimented. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many now believe the holy grail for the next stage of therapeutic advance surrounds the development of diseasemodifying approaches aimed at intercepting the year-on-year neurodegenerative decline experienced by most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on recommendations of an international committee of experts who are currently bringing multiple, potentially disease-modifying, PD therapeutics into long-term neuroprotective PD trials, a clinical trial involving 198 patients is underwayto determine whether Simvastatin provides protection against chronic neurodegeneration. Statins are widely used to reduce cardiovascular risk, and act as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. It is also known that statins serve as ligands for PPAR alpha, a known arbiter for mitochondrial size and number. Statins possess multiple cholesterol-independent biochemical mechanisms of action, many of which offer neuroprotective potential (suppression of proinflammatory molecules & microglial activation, stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inhibition of oxidative stress, attenuation of alpha-synuclein aggregation, modulation of adaptive immunity, and increased expression of neurotrophic factors). We describe the biochemical, physiological and pharmaceutical credentials that continue to underpin the rationale for taking Simvastatin into a disease-modifying trial in PD patients. While unrelated to the Simvastatin trial (because this conducted in patients who already have PD), we discuss conflicting epidemiological studies which variously suggest that statin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis may increase or decrease risk of developing PD. Finally, since so few disease-modifying PD trials have ever been launched (compared to those of symptomatic therapies), we discuss the rationale of the trial structure we have adopted, decisions made, and lessons learnt so far.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis C virus ( HCV) is a widespread and costly cause of morbidity and mortality globally and in the United States. The treatment of HCV has been revolutionized with the recent development of direct acting antiviral medications. These new treatments are substantially better tolerated and more efficacious than previously used interferon-based therapies. Despite these innovations, sustained virologic response has remained low, hovering at approximately 9% of all infected persons. The reasons for this failure include lack of screening, low rates of linkage to care, cost of direct-acting antivirals, and barriers in access to care for patients. Psychiatrists work with patients at a disproportionately high risk for HCV infection yet many do not currently assume an active role in the HCV epidemic. Objective: The purpose of this clinical review is to familiarize psychiatrists with currently available hepatitis C treatments and discuss the remaining treatment challenges, including the high cost of treatment. Methods: The authors used information from the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration on the most current estimates of HCV epidemiology, risk factors, and approved interferon free treatments. PUBMED was searched for examples of HCV treatment in community psychiatry settings. Conclusions: The mental health community is well positioned to take on a more active role in HCV treatment and engage patients' trust in the treatment process. However, many barriers still exist. We encourage psychiatrists to assume a collaborative role in caring for psychiatric patients infected with HCV.

AB  - The results of contemporary studies confirm the formation of two neural networks in the brain during the period of adolescence. The first is defined as emotional, located in the limbic system, develops earlier, quicker, and more intensively than the second one in the prefrontal cortex, called the judgement network, which fulfils the role of control and inhibition of emotional reactions. The domination of the emotional network in adolescence is manifested by hyperactivity of the limbic system, accompanied by intensified undertaking of courageous, reckless, risky, or even sometimes dangerous actions, so very characteristic in the maturation. The aim of the article is to present the state of the art in the field of latest achievements in experimental neurophysiology related to the maturation of the structural end functional processes in adolescents, and to alcohol vulnerability. Alcohol effect initiation starts in early adolescence, and therefore is connected with alcohol abuse and addiction in adulthood, which confirms the necessity for provision of an early prophylactic protection for juveniles, even before entering the phase of early adolescence. Some electrophysiological characteristics, such as low P3 amplitude of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) and Event-Related Oscillations (EROs), are manifested by their high risk offspring, and are considered to be biological markers (endophenotypes) of a predisposition to develop alcohol use disorders. Electroencephalographic oscillations induced within the range of the theta and delta waves (Event-Related Oscillation-ERO), considered as endophenotypes and markers of increased vulnerability for addiction, present three groups of genes and three types of neurotransmitters, with gamma aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine and glutamate as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. A new research approach consisting in the application of electroencephalographic methods and techniques in developmental and genetic studies of the conditioning of varied vulnerability, and especially increased preferences for alcohol tasting and abuse in adolescence, provide unique possibilities for comprehensive and deepened studies which may contribute to the prevention of alcohol addiction, the genesis of which, to a great extent, is related with the effect of causative environmental and genetic factors during adolescent development.

In addition, the authors' research with polygonal arenas and complex labyrinth (designed by the first author for confrontation between snakes and small rodents) was examined.
   Results: The EPM and ETM tests evoke anxiety/fear-related defensive responses that are pharmacologically validated, whereas the confrontation between rodents and snakes in polygonal arenas with or without shelters or in the complex labyrinth offers ethological conditions for studying more complex defensive behaviors and the effects of anxiolytic and panicolytic drugs. Prey vs. predator paradigms also allow discrimination between non-oriented and oriented escape behavior.
   Conclusions: Both EPM and ETM simple labyrinths are excellent apparatuses for the study of anxietyand instinctive fear-related responses, respectively. The confrontation between rodents and snakes in polygonal arenas, however, offers a more ethological environment for addressing both unconditioned and conditioned fear-induced behaviors and the effects of anxiolytic and panicolytic drugs.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide remains an important public health issue in Australia, responsible for around 2500 deaths each year. Although suicide only accounts for around 1.7% of total mortality in Australia per year, 75% of suicide deaths are in males. This article reviews the factors contributing to suicide in older rural males in Australia and then categorises the papers into themes for ease of explanation. Living with experiences of drought, dramatic weather change, lower employment opportunities, out-migration, changing family dynamics, ageism in the community, economic change and competitive labour markets, all add to the diverse experience for an older person who is ageing in a rural setting.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted in March 2015, using the terms 'elderly' and 'older males' and then combined with 'rural', 'suicide' and 'Australia', to investigate the amount of research that has been conducted on the factors relating to suicide in older rural Australian males.
   Results: Reviewed articles consisted of research using either quantitative or qualitative approaches, which investigated suicide in older Australians published between 1950 and 2014. With strict adherence to the selection criteria, articles (21 in total) were removed because they were a literature review; a narrative review; they focused predominantly on youth or suicide risk, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts; or they discussed reasons for living. This article discusses the researcher's recommendations for further research into employment transitions for older Australian males, and the need to review policy change for further intervention in the future.
   Conclusions: This article highlights factors that may cause older rural Australians to be placed at a higher risk of suicide than their urban-dwelling counterparts. With the impact of the changing economy, unpredictable climatic conditions and dynamic changes in rural Australian families, there is a need to highlight research that has been conducted in this area. Future research should focus on identification of misclassification of suicide deaths, investigation of the possible effect that retirement pathways may have on older Australian males, suicide prevention strategies, mental wellbeing and the risk of suicidal behaviour. This will ascertain any compounding or protective factors that could influence this current trend.

AB  - The colorful carotenoid pigments are known as biological active compounds that have beneficial effects on the metabolism of animals and humans. Carotenoids provide protection against several stressors, including UV radiation, reactive oxygen species and free radicals, have important roles in vision, and act as precursors of transcription regulators and in the immune system. Studies on human nutrition point to the relevance of consuming functional foods instead of supplementing the human diet with the desired nutrients. This stresses the importance of obtaining dietary items with high quality nutritional value for human consumption. The various biological roles of carotenoids in aquatic animals ascribes them a major role in aquaculture where they are routinely added to ensure the development and health of fish such as salmon, trout and red porgy, and of shellfish like shrimp and lobster. In aquaculture, it is widely recognized that fish larvae dramatically increase their survival rate when reared on live feeds (e.g., rotifers, Artemia sp. and copepods) containing carotenoids. Ultimately, pigmentation provided by carotenoids is one of the relevant quality attributes of the aquatic animal for consumer acceptability and market value. Appropriate feeds for aquaculture are thus required to provide the carotenoids necessary for the desired pigmentation. In this review, we discuss the role of carotenoids in aquatic food webs, both in the wild and in aquaculture, and its relevance for human health.

AB  - This systematic review presents the current state of research investigating the implicit self-concept of personality. First, we present results on meta-analyses estimating internal consistency, reliability coefficients, the implicit-explicit consistency and the single association predictive effect of implicit self-concept of personality measures. To do this, studies were aggregated over personality domains. Second, for each of the Five Factor personality domains, different aspects of construct validity and predictive validity are reviewed in a narrative way. Results show that implicit self-concept of personality measures are reliable, and there is evidence for the construct and predictive validity of these implicit measures, especially in the extraversion and agreeableness domains of personality. However, it must be kept in mind that clear evidence for publication bias was found for studies examining the single association predictive pattern. Finally, this systematic review identifies some achievable improvements that are needed in future research. Large cross-lab efforts are important in this respect. Moreover, the implicit self-concept of personality field must move from an 'ad hoc' to a 'validation' approach in developing new indirect measurement tasks. By adopting these research objectives, the information processing account of personality will increase its potential to become integrated into mainstream personality theory and research.

AB  - Fatigue jeopardizes seafarer's health and safety. Thus, knowledge on determinants of fatigue is of great importance to facilitate its prevention. However, a systematic analysis and quality assessment of all empirical evidence specifically for fatigue are still lacking. The aim of the present article was therefore to systematically detect, analyze and assess the quality of this evidence.
   Systematic searches in ten databases were performed. Searches considered articles published in scholarly journals from 1980 to April 15, 2016. Nineteen out of 98 eligible studies were included in the review. The main reason for exclusion was fatigue not being the outcome variable.
   Most evidence was available for work time-related factors suggesting that working nights was most fatiguing, that fatigue levels were higher toward the end of watch or shift, and that the 6-h on-6-h off watch system was the most fatiguing. Specific work demands and particularly the psychosocial work environment have received little attention, but preliminary evidence suggests that stress may be an important factor. A majority of 12 studies were evaluated as potentially having a high risk of bias.
   Realistic countermeasures ought to be established, e.g., in terms of shared or split night shifts. As internal as well as external validity of many study findings was limited, the range of factors investigated was insufficient and few studies investigated more complex interactions between different factors, knowledge derived from studies of high methodological quality investigating different factors, including psychosocial work environments, are needed to support future preventive programs.

AB  - While the health risks associated with adult cigarette smoking have been well described, effects of nicotine exposure during periods of developmental vulnerability are often overlooked. Using MEDLINE and PubMed literature searches, books, reports and expert opinion, a transdisciplinary group of scientists reviewed human and animal research on the health effects of exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and adolescence. A synthesis of this research supports that nicotine contributes critically to adverse effects of gestational tobacco exposure, including reduced pulmonary function, auditory processing defects, impaired infant cardiorespiratory function, and may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits in later life. Nicotine exposure during adolescence is associated with deficits in working memory, attention, and auditory processing, as well as increased impulsivity and anxiety. Finally, recent animal studies suggest that nicotine has a priming effect that increases addiction liability for other drugs. The evidence that nicotine adversely affects fetal and adolescent development is sufficient to warrant public health measures to protect pregnant women, children, and adolescents from nicotine exposure.

AB  - What is the relation between the two visual stream hypothesis and selective visual attention? In this chapter, we first consider this question at a theoretical level before presenting an example of work from our lab that examines the question: Under what conditions does the emotional content of a visual object influence visually guided action? Previous research has demonstrated that fear can influence perception, both consciously and unconsciously, but it is unclear when fear influences visually guided action. The study tested participants with varying degrees of spiderphobia on two visually guided pointing tasks, while manipulating the emotional valence of the target (positive and negative) and the cognitive load of the participant (single vs dual task). Participants rapidly moved their finger from a home position to a suddenly appearing target image on a touch screen. The images were emotionally negative (e.g., spiders and scorpions) or positive (e.g., flowers and food). In order to test the effect of emotional valence on the online control of the reach, the target either remained static or jumped to a new location. In both the single and dual tasks, a stream of digits were presented on the screen near the finger's starting location, but only in the dual task were participants asked to identify a letter somewhere in the stream. In the single task, increased fear of spiders reduced the speed and accuracy of the movement. In the dual task, increased fear impaired letter identification, but pointing actions were now equally efficient for low-and high-fear participants. These results imply that the finger's autopilot is influenced by emotional content only when attention can be fully devoted to the identification of the emotion-evoking images. As such, the results support the view that the mechanisms of selection are not the same in the two visual streams.

AB  - Objective: A congenital craniofacial anomaly (CFA) is expected to impact upon several domains of psychological, emotional and social functioning, yet no recent reviews have comprehensively summarised the available literature. Further, existing reviews tend to draw upon literature in the field of cleft lip and palate, and do not give substantive attention to other types of CFAs.
   Design: A review of 41 papers published between January 2000 and March 2016 pertaining to psychological adjustment to CFAs.
   Main outcome measures: Findings are presented according to key psychological domains: General Psychological Well-being, Quality of Life, Behaviour, Emotional Well-being, Social Experiences, Appearance, and Treatment-Related Experiences.
   Results: Current literature offers a contradictory picture of adjustment to CFAs. Psychological adjustment appeared to be comparable to norms and reference groups in approximately half of the papers related to non-syndromic CFAs, while more variation was found across domains among samples with syndromic CFAs. Associations were found between adjustment, physical health and cognitive function in several papers. The review identified a number of gaps in the literature, such as the inclusion of a wide range of diagnoses within research samples.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates the complexity of findings, both within and across domains, and highlights a number of methodological challenges.

AB  - Ultrasound (US) is widely known for its utility as a biomedical imaging modality. An abundance of evidence has recently accumulated showing that US is also useful for non-invasively modulating brain circuit activity. Through a series of studies discussed in this short review, it has recently become recognized that transcranial focused ultrasound can exert mechanical (non-thermal) bioeffects on neurons and cells to produce focal changes in the activity of brain circuits. In addition to highlighting scientific breakthroughs and observations that have driven the development of the field of ultrasonic neuromodulation, this study also provides a discussion of mechanisms of action underlying the ability of ultrasound to physically stimulate and modulate brain circuit activity. Exemplifying some forward-looking tools that can be developed by integrating ultrasonic neuromodulation with other advanced acoustic technologies, some innovative acoustic imaging, beam forming, and focusing techniques are briefly reviewed. Finally, the future outlook for ultrasonic neuromodulation is discussed, specifically in the context of applications employing transcranial focused ultrasound for the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: To summarize all available evidence from systematic reviews about the impact of stress response in development of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in schizophrenia.
   Methods: An overview of systematic reviews of any type of primary studies was performed. An electronic search of five databases was conducted in February 2017 (CDSR, DARE, Embase, MEDLINE and PsychINFO). Quality of included systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist.
   Results: Eight systematic reviews were included. The main findings of the included reviews point out a possible alteration of the stress response in a subgroup of persons with proneness to psychosis. However, the evidence is limited by the inadequate quality of studies, as well as lack of standardization of outcomes and assessment methods.
   Conclusions: Given the heterogeneity of current results, there is no solid evidence for uniform alterations of stress response found in persons with FEP in suggestive of schizophrenia that may serve as a marker of vulnerability to stress and possibly proneness to psychotic state in response to daily hassles.

It will also include information on safety and other ECT outcomes (seizure threshold and quality).Methods: A systematic search through MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Databases and reference lists from retrieved articles was performed. Search terms were: ketamine and Electroconvulsive Therapy, from 1995 to September 2016. Meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, open-label and retrospective studies published in English of depressed samples receiving ECT with ketamine anaesthesia were included (n=24).Results: Studies were heterogeneous in the clinical populations included and ECT treatment and anaesthetic methods. Frequently, studies did not report on ECT factors (i.e., pulse-width, treatment schedule). Findings regarding efficacy were mixed. Tolerance from repeated use may explain why several studies found that ketamine enhanced efficacy early in the ECT course but not at the end. The majority of studies did not comprehensively examine cognition and adverse effects were not systematically studied. Only a minority of the studies reported on seizure threshold and expression.Conclusions: The routine use of ketamine anaesthesia for ECT in clinical settings cannot yet be recommended based on published data. Larger randomised controlled trials, taking into account moderator variables, specifically reporting on ECT parameters and systematically assessing outcomes are encouraged.

AB  - The use of organic amendments produced from organic waste has been widely studied. Not much is known, however, about the use of such amendments for restoring abandoned or degraded soils in arid and semiarid areas that could serve as good carbon sinks. Such soils have scarce vegetation and organic matter but contain a variety of microorganisms adapted to different types of stress. The characteristics of. organic amendments. depend on their origin (urban: domestic organic waste and sludges from urban wastewater treatments; other: animal (manure), agricultural or agroindustrial) and determine in part their potential positive or negative effects on the soils they are applied to. The way amendments have been treated (e.g., composting) also determines how they will behave in the soil. This review covers the last 15 years of published research concerning the use of organic amendments on degraded soils in arid and semiarid environments for restoration purposes.

AB  - Sexual selection describes the reproductive dynamics that drive the evolution of many sex differences but is rarely used to guide the study of brain development or function. This Mini-Review describes how these dynamics can result in trait elaboration in one sex or the other and why these traits have a heightened sensitivity to stressors. The framework provides a conceptual model that will help to organize what we know about sex differences in brain and cognition, a means to focus the search for additional sex differences, and a means to predict brain systems that are particularly vulnerable to disruption by exposure to stressors. This Mini-Review briefly illustrates these points using sex differences in birdsong and spatial navigation to highlight the benefits and the nuances of using evolutionary theory to help frame neuroscience studies of sex differences.

AB  - Sex differences exist in the vulnerability, incidence, manifestation, and treatment of numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases. Despite this observation prominent in the literature, little consideration has been given to possible sex differences in outcome in both preclinical and clinical research. This Mini-Review highlights evidence supporting why studying sex differences matter for advances in brain health as well as improving treatment for neurological and psychiatric disease. Additionally, we discuss some statistical and methodological considerations in evaluating sex differences as well as how differences in the physiology of the sexes can contribute to sex difference in disease incidence and manifestation. Furthermore, we review literature demonstrating that the reproductive experience in the female can render the female brain differentially vulnerable to disease across age. Finally, we discuss how genes interact with sex to influence disease risk and treatment and argue that sex must be considered in precision medicine. Together the evidence reviewed here supports the inclusion of males and females at all levels of neuroscience research. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   We reviewed the interaction between light, temperature and herbicides on algal and cyanobacterial physiology.
   Temperature is the main factor affecting herbicide toxicity to algae and cyanobacteria.
   Changes in light environment may modulate the effects of photosynthesis-targeting herbicides.
   Important interactions between climatic parameters and herbicide toxicity have been discussed in the literature. As climate changes are expected to influence the growth conditions of aquatic photosynthetic organisms over the next century by modifying the physicochemical parameters of the environment (such as temperature and incident light characteristics), the following questions arise: How will variations in climatic conditions influence herbicide toxicity in algae and cyanobacteria? Are these coupled effects on aquatic photosynthetic organism physiology antagonistic, additive, or synergistic? We discuss here the physiological responses of algae and cyanobacteria to the combined effects of environmental changes (temperature and light) and herbicide exposure. Both temperature and light are proposed to influence herbicide toxicity through acclimation processes that are mainly related to cell size and photosynthesis. Algal and cyanobacterial responses to interactions between light, temperature, and herbicides are species-specific, making it difficult today to establish a single model of how climate changes will affect toxicity of herbicides. Acclimation processes could assure the maintenance of primary production but total biodiversity should decrease in communities exposed to herbicides under changing temperature and light conditions. The inclusion of considerations on the impacts of environmental changes on toxicity of herbicides in water quality guidelines directed toward protecting aquatic life is now urgently needed.

AB  - Context-aware recommendation systems attempt to address the challenge of identifying products or items that have the greatest chance of meeting user requirements by adapting to current contextual information. Many such systems have been developed in domains such as movies, books, and music, and emotion is a contextual parameter that has already been used in those fields. This paper focuses on the use of emotion as a contextual parameter in a tourist destination recommendation system. We developed a new corpus that incorporates the emotion parameter by employing semantic analysis techniques for destination recommendation. We review the effectiveness of incorporating emotion in a recommendation process using prefiltering techniques and show that the use of emotion as a contextual parameter for location recommendation in conjunction with collaborative filtering increases user satisfaction.

AB  - Purpose - Shared decision making (SDM) prioritises joint deliberation between practitioner and service user, and a respect for service-users' experiential knowledge, values and preferences. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature pertaining to key stakeholders' attitudes towards SDM in mental health. It examines whether perceived barriers and facilitators differ by group (e.g. service user, psychiatrist, nurse and social worker) and includes views of what facilitates and hinders the process for service users and practitioners.
   Design/methodology/approach - This review adopts the principles of a qualitative research synthesis. A key word search of research published between 1990 and 2016 was undertaken. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies were included.
   Findings - In total, 43 papers were included and several themes identified for service user and practitioner perspectives. Both practitioners and service users see SDM as an ethical imperative, and both groups highlight the need to be flexible in implementing SDM, suggesting it is context dependent. A range of challenges and barriers are presented by both practitioners and service users reflecting complex contextual and cultural features within which interactions in mental health take place. There were qualitative differences in what service users and practitioners describe as preventing or enabling SDM. The differences highlighted point towards different challenges and priorities in SDM for service users and practitioners.
   Originality/value - The presentation of nuanced views and attitudes that practitioners and service users hold represent an important and under reported area and offer insight into the reasons for the gap between idealised policy and actual practice of SDM in mental health settings.

AB  - The amygdala is a small subcortical structure located bilaterally in medial temporal lobes. It is a key region for emotional processes and some forms of associative learning. In particular, the role of the amygdala in processing of negative emotions and aversive learning has been shown in numerous studies. However, involvement of this structure in processing of positive affect and appetitive learning is not fully understood. Previous experiments in animals are not consistent. While some authors implicate only the centromedial part of the amygdala in appetitive learning, the others suggest contribution of both centromedial and basolateral subregions. Although from the evolutionary perspective appetitive learning is equally important as aversive learning, research on the role of the human amygdala and its subregions in appetitive learning is undertaken relatively rarely and the results are not conclusive. Therefore, the aim of this review is twofold: to summarize the current knowledge in this field and to indicate and discuss the factors, which might affect the observed level of the amygdala activity during appetitive learning in humans.

AB  - Unemployment is associated with a diminished mental health. Interventions to improve mental health for the unemployed exist. However, there is no clear overview with respect to the content and effectiveness of these interventions. A systematic search was conducted and, included studies that targeted unemployed adults, described an intervention and reported mental health as an outcome measure. After screening, 24 studies remained, which contained 21 different interventions. These interventions could be classified into three categories: occupational skills training interventions, psychological interventions and combined interventions. The majority of the studies reported significant short-term effects on mental health, but in most cases evidence of sustained effects was lacking or not assessed. There is promising evidence that interventions combining occupational skills and resilience training are effective in promoting mental health. However, there is a need for high-quality research on the intervention effects on the mental health of the (long-term) unemployed.

AB  - Objective: Clinical trials demonstrated that ketamine exhibits rapid antidepressant efficacy when administered in subanaesthetic dosages. We reviewed currently available literature investigating efficacy, response rates and safety profile.Methods: Twelve studies investigating unipolar, seven on bipolar depression were included after search in medline, scopus and web of science.Results: Randomized, placebo-controlled or open-label trials reported antidepressant response rates after 24h on primary outcome measures at 61%. The average reduction of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was 10.9 points, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) 15.7 points and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 20.8 points. Ketamine was always superior to placebo. Most common side effects were dizziness, blurred vision, restlessness, nausea/vomiting and headache, which were all reversible. Relapse rates ranged between 60% and 92%. To provide best practice-based information to patients, a consent-form for application and modification in local language is included.Conclusions: Ketamine constitutes a novel, rapid and efficacious treatment option for patients suffering from treatment resistant depression and exhibits rapid and significant anti-suicidal effects. New administration routes might serve as alternative to intravenous regimes for potential usage in outpatient settings. However, long-term side effects are not known and short duration of antidepressant response need ways to prolong ketamine's efficacy.

AB  - Objective. To estimate the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among the general population of Latin America and the Caribbean, by country, in 2012.
   Methods. Three steps were taken: a comprehensive, systematic literature search; meta-analyses, assuming a random-effects model for countries with published studies; and regression modelling (data prediction) for countries with either no published studies or too few to obtain an estimate.
   Results. Based on 24 existing studies, the pooled prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among the general population was estimated for Brazil (15.2%; 95% confidence interval [ 95% CI]: 10.4%-20.8%) and Mexico (1.2%; 95% CI: 0.0%-2.7%). The prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among the general population was predicted for 31 countries and ranged from 4.8% (95% CI: 4.2%-5.4%) in Cuba to 23.3% (95% CI: 20.1%-26.5%) in Grenada.
   Conclusions. Greater prevention efforts and measures are needed in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to prevent pregnant women from consuming alcohol during pregnancy and decrease the rates of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Additional high quality studies on the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Latin America and the Caribbean are also needed.

AB  - Many children across the world are exposed to school violence, which undermines their right to education and adversely affects their development. Studies of interventions for school violence suggest that it can be prevented. However, this evidence base is challenging to navigate. We completed a systematic review of interventions to reduce four types of school violence: (a) peer violence; (b) corporal punishment; (c) student-on-teacher violence and (d) teacher-on-student violence. Reviewers independently searched databases and journals. Included studies were published between 2005 and 2015; in English; considered school-based interventions for children and measured violence as an outcome. Many systematic reviews were found, thus we completed a systematic review of systematic reviews. Only systematic reviews on interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) and peer aggression were found. These reviews were generally of moderate quality. Research on both types of violence was largely completed in North America. Only a handful of programmes demonstrate promise in preventing IPV. Cognitive behavioral, social-emotional and peer mentoring/mediation programmes showed promise in reducing the levels of perpetration of peer aggression. Further research needs to determine the long-term effects of interventions, potential moderators and mediators of program effects, program effects across different contexts and key intervention components.

AB  - Climate change is causing increases in temperature, changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other environmental impacts. It is also causing or contributing to heat-related disorders, respiratory and allergic disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition due to food insecurity, and mental health disorders. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that climate change is causally associated with collective violence, generally in combination with other causal factors. Increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources, are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence. Public health professionals can help prevent collective violence due to climate change (a) by supporting mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (b) by promoting adaptation measures to address the consequences of climate change and to improve community resilience, and (c) by addressing underlying risk factors for collective violence, such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities.

AB  - Background: Secondary interventions are implemented within a short interval following the occurrence of traumatic events with the purpose of preventing the onset of PTSD. Objective: Analyze the results of studies that assessed post-trauma interventions in adults aimed at preventing the onset of PTSD or symptoms related to PTSD. Methods: We performed literature searches using the search expression [(Early intervention OR secondary prevention) AND (Post traumatic stress disorder OR PTSD)] for articles published until October 2016. Among the references found, 29 fulfilled the selection criteria established for the review. Data were divided and analyzed according to the type of intervention: pharmacological or psychological. Results: Psychological measures used in the studies lack homogeneity regarding the type of intervention and the assessment of intervention outcomes. Pharmacological interventions were less frequent and findings require replication, together with an expansion in the types of substances investigated. In general, many of the studies reviewed suggest that both pharmacological and psychological interventions are effective in the prevention of PTSD. Discussion: Future trials should be focused on determining the best interventions for the secondary prevention of PTSD. The combination of psychological and pharmacological interventions for post-trauma patients poses opportunities and challenges that remain unexplored.

AB  - Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) promote the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons which degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, CDNF and MANF are structurally and functionally clearly distinct from the classical, target-derived neurotrophic factors (NTFs) that are solely secreted proteins. In cells, CDNF and MANF localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and evidence suggests that MANF, and possibly CDNF, is important for the maintenance of ER homeostasis. MANF expression is particularly high in secretory tissues with extensive protein production and thus a high ER protein folding load. Deletion of MANF in mice results in a diabetic phenotype and the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) in the pancreatic islets. However, information about the intracellular and extra cellular mechanisms of MANF and CDNF action is still limited. Here we will discuss the structural motifs and physiological functions of CDNF and MANF as well as their therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. Currently available knockout models of MANF and CDNF in mice, zebrafish and fruit fly will increase information about the biology of these interesting proteins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of a fetal anomaly in perinatal medicine forces expectant parents and healthcare providers to face the difficult process of breaking bad news.Objectives: This exploratory literature review was aimed at providing a medical and psychological view of the psychological experience in expectant parents and physicians in the context of prenatal diagnosis of a fetal anomaly.Method: An exploratory search of PubMed and PsycINFO/PsycARTICLES databases performed by an interdisciplinary team composed of a physician and psychologists. Search terms were: prenatal diagnosis AND bad news; prenatal diagnosis AND psychological consequences; prenatal diagnosis AND psychological sequelae; prenatal diagnosis AND fetal abnormality. The processing of selected articles followed a standardised five-step procedure.Results: A total of 860 articles were screened of which 32 were retained for analysis. Four main themes emerged from the explanatory content analysis: (1) parents' subjective experience; (2) physicians' subjective experience; (3) encounters between expectant parents and professionals; and (4) ethical challenges in breaking bad news in prenatal medicine.Conclusion: Expectant parents go through a complex and multidimensional experience when the diagnosis of a fetal anomaly is disclosed. Simultaneously, physicians consider breaking bad news as a very stressful event and are poorly prepared in this regard. A better knowledge of factors underlying psychological adjustment of the parental dyad and on the subjective experience of physicians delivering these diagnoses could enable better adaptation for both patients and professionals.

AB  - The brain continuously maintains a current representation of its immediate surroundings. Perceptual representations are often updated when the world changes, e.g., when we notice an object move. However, we can also update representations internally, without incoming signals from the senses. In other words, we can run internal simulations of dynamic events. This ability is evident during mental object rotation. These uncontroversial observations lead to an obvious question that nevertheless remains to be answered: How does the brain control the speed of dynamic mental simulations? Is there a central rate controller or pacemaker module in the brain that can be temporarily coupled to sensory maps? We can refer to this as the common rate control theory. Alternatively, the primitive intelligence within each map could tune into the speed of recent changes and use this information to keep going after stimuli disappear. We can call this the separate rate control theory. Preliminary evidence from prediction motion experiments supports common rate control, although local predictive mechanisms may cover short gaps of <200 ms. The putative rate controller might turn out to be the same thing as the velocity store described in smooth pursuit eye movement models and/or the pacemaker module proposed in the cognitive timing literature. Indirect neuroimaging evidence suggests rate control is a function of the core timing system in the dorsal striatum.

AB  - Objective: Insomnia is associated with increased risk for suicide. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated that warnings regarding suicide be included in the prescribing information for hypnotic medications. The authors conducted a review of the evidence for and against the claim that hypnotics increase the risk of suicide.
   Method: This review focused on modern, FDA-approved hypnotics, beginning with the introduction of benzodiazepines, limiting its findings to adults. PubMed and Web of Science were searched, crossing the terms "suicide" and "suicidal" with each of the modern FDA-approved hypnotics. The FDA web site was searched for postmarketing safety reviews, and the FDA was contacted with requests to provide detailed case reports for hypnotic-related suicide deaths reported through its Adverse Event Reporting System.
   Results: Epidemiological studies show that hypnotics are associated with an increased risk for suicide. However, none of these studies adequately controlled for depression or other psychiatric disorders that may be linked with insomnia. Suicide deaths have been reported from single agent hypnotic overdoses. A separate concern is that benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics can cause parasomnias, which in rare cases may lead to suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in persons who were not known to be suicidal. On the other hand, ongoing research is testing whether treatment of insomnia may reduce suicidality in adults with depression.
   Conclusions: The review findings indicate that hypnotic medications are associated with suicidal ideation. Future studies should be designed to assess whether increases in suicidality result from CNS impairments from a given hypnotic medication or whether such medication decreases suicidality because of improvements in insomnia.

AB  - The microbial contribution to ecological resilience is still largely overlooked in coral reef ecology. Coral associated bacteria serve a wide variety of functional roles with reference to the coral host, and thus, the composition of the overall microbiome community can strongly influence coral health and survival. Here, we synthesize the findings of recent studies (n = 45) that evaluated the impacts of the top three stressors facing coral reefs (climate change, water pollution and overfishing) on coral microbiome community structure and diversity. Contrary to the species losses that are typical of many ecological communities under stress, here we show that microbial richness tends to be higher rather than lower for stressed corals (i.e., in similar to 60% of cases), regardless of the stressor. Microbial responses to stress were taxonomically consistent across stressors, with specific taxa typically increasing in abundance (e.g., Vibrionales, Flavobacteriales, Rhodobacterales, Alteromonadales, Rhizobiales, Rhodospirillales, and Desulfovibrionales) and others declining (e.g., Oceanosprillales). Emerging evidence also suggests that stress may increase the microbial beta diversity amongst coral colonies, potentially reflecting a reduced ability of the coral host to regulate its microbiome. Moving forward, studies will need to discern the implications of stress-induced shifts in microbiome diversity for the coral hosts and may be able to use microbiome community structure to identify resilient corals. The evidence we present here supports the hypothesis that microbial communities play important roles in ecological resilience, and we encourage a focus on the microbial contributions to resilience for future research.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic search of the peer- reviewed qualitative literature investigating the lived experience of seclusion for adults with mental health difficulties, to appraise the quality of the existing literature and synthesise findings. Background: seclusion is a controversial intervention for the short-term management of unsafe behaviours in inpatient mental health services. There has been some sporadic interest in service users' experiences of this.
   Design/methodology/approach - Systematic literature review and meta- synthesis: data sources databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PSYCINFO were searched in July 2015; review methods - the Joanna Briggs Institute's Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument tools for critical appraisal and data extraction were used to review papers and synthesise findings.
   Findings - A small number of papers were found, which were of mixed quality.
   Originality/value - The existing research is limited in both quantity and quality. Although most participants from the existing research described seclusion as mostly negative with the potential for causing iatrogenic harm, some described more positive experiences, often in the context of compassionate interactions with staff.

By searching keywords related to social support and SNSs in major databases for social sciences, we identified and content analyzed directly relevant articles (N=88). The article summarizes the prevalence of theory usage; the function of theory usage (e.g., testing a theory, developing a theory); major theories referenced; and methodologies, including research designs, measurement, and the roles of social support and SNS examined in this literature. It also reports four themes identified across the studies, indicating the trends in the current research. Based on the review, the article presents a discussion about study sites, conceptualization of social support, theoretical coherence, the role of social networks, and the dynamic relationships between SNS use and social support, which points out potential avenues for shaping a future research agenda.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of depression is not only highly prevalent but also remarkable heterogeneous symptomatically. Only a few symptoms are considered common to most presentations of depression, while others form various combinations to define subtypes of depressive disorder. Most antemortem neuroimaging studies and postmortem neurochemical and cellular research have demonstrated significant structural, functional and cellular alterations shared by a majority of subjects with depression. However, it seems very likely that identifying relevant etiological factors and cellular mechanisms associated with the specific neuropathology of depression subtypes may help to focus or individualize depression treatments.
   Objective: The main aim of this review article is to point to the need of studying those differential cellular mechanisms characterizing different subtypes of depression as they relate to relevant neural circuits.
   Method: The review is based on a literature search using mainly PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Articles were considered relevant if they contained studies relating depression subtypes (or distinct symptom clusters) to neuroimaging or neuropathological parameters.
   Results and Conclusions: Antemortem quantification in psychiatric diagnostic scales and neuroimaging studies, with their larger number of subjects, have started to identify functional differences that discriminate depression subtypes. However, characterization of cellular and neurochemical pathology in neurons and glial cells has yet to be directed to uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms in relevant brain centers and circuits differentially affected in depression subtypes. Identifying these mechanisms will depend on our ability to first sort out cellular alterations by combining postmortem and animal model studies of depression subtypes.

AB  - Emotions play a significant role in guiding everyday actions and strongly interact with attention. The processing of emotional information over time and the influence of attention on such processing has been studied through the phenomenon of attentional blink using rapid serial visual presentations (RSVP) tasks. This chapter discusses the interaction between temporal attention and the type of emotional information (words, scenes, and facial expressions) presented during or before the RSVP stream. The findings show that the affective content and the arousal value of the emotional stimuli presented as first target, second target, or both affects the magnitude and the duration of the blink window. In addition, modulation of emotional context or presentation of emotions in the RSVP stream as task irrelevant distractors also influenced attentional blink. Further, this chapter discusses different models and theories of attentional blink and attempts to explain the emotional effects. The chapter concludes with possible scope for future studies.

Specific search criteria utilizing a PRISMA format were used across 5 databases, which resulted in 454 papers being identified. After utilizing exclusion criteria and then review, nine of the 454 papers identified were retained for extensive synthesis and critique. Results: Results from 8 of the identified papers indicated that both intra and inter personal factors can influence self-injury cessation. These include: family support, self-esteem, emotional regulation, and professional help. Only 1 paper articulated a cessation process, describing it as a procedural event of developing interpersonal strength, then implementing alternative coping strategies. Limitations and implications of the studies are reported, concluding that further research is warranted to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies to ameliorate this growing public health concern.

AB  - Background: Romantic relationships are one of the most interesting areas of interpersonal functioning in people with borderline personality. The aim of this narrative review was to synthesise empirical findings on this issue. Sampling and Methods: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for pertinent materials published between 1980 and March 2016. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: Several longitudinal and cross-sectional studies showed that people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) or BPD traits had more - but less prolonged - romantic relationships than people without BPD. The stable relationships of people with BPD or with BPD traits were also less satisfying and more hostile than those of people without BPD. People with BPD or BPD traits had relationships characterised by insecure attachment and passive-aggressive communications. Personality disorders and anxious attachment were more prevalent among the partners of people with BPD or with BPD traits when compared with partners of people without BPD. Conclusion: Unstable and chaotic romantic relationships are at the core of interpersonal dysfunction in BPD. More longitudinal research is needed to delineate the relationship between BPD symptoms and romantic relationship dysfunction, including the modulating role of the partner's clinical features in such an association.

AB  - Sexual differentiation of the brain occurs early in life as a result of sex-typical hormone action and sex chromosome effects. Immunocompetent cells are being recognized as underappreciated regulators of sex differences in brain and behavioral development, including microglia, astrocytes, and possibly other less well studied cell types, including T cells and mast cells. Immunocompetent cells in the brain are responsive to steroid hormones, but their role in sex-specific brain development is an emerging field of interest. This Review presents a summary of what is currently known about sex differences in the number, morphology, and signaling profile of immune cells in the developing brain and their role in the early-life programming of sex differences in brain and behavior. We review what is currently known about sex differences in the response to early-life perturbations, including stress, inflammation, diet, and environmental pollutants. We also discuss how and why understanding sex differences in the developing neuroimmune environment may provide insight into understanding the etiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders. This Review also highlights what remains to be discovered in this emerging field of developmental neuroimmunology and underscores the importance of filling in these knowledge gaps.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is an important cause of neurological deficits in humans, and the Levine-Rice model of experimental HI in the rat mimics the human brain lesion and the following sensory motor deficits and cognitive disabilities. With the growing evidence that sex influences all levels of brain functions, this Mini-Review highlights studies in which sex was a controlled variable and that provided evidence of sexual dimorphism in behavioral outcome, extension of brain damage, mechanisms of lesion, and treatment efficacy in the rat neonatal HI model. It was shown that 1) females have greater memory deficits; 2) cell death is dependent mainly on caspase activation in females; 3) males are more susceptible to oxidative stress; and 4) treatments acting on distinct cell death pathways afford sex-dependent neuroprotection. These tentative conclusions, along with growing evidence from other fields of neurobiology, support the need for scientists to design their experiments considering sex as an important variable; otherwise, important knowledge will continue to be missed. It is conceivable that sex can influence the development of efficacious therapeutic tools to treat neonates suffering from brain HI. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Following the discovery of a higher than expected incidence of Parkinson Disease (PD) in Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, mutations in the glucocerebrocidase (GBA) gene, which encodes a lysosomal enzyme involved in sphingolipid degradation were explored in the context of idiopathic PD. GBA mutations are now known to be the single largest risk factor for development of idiopathic PD. Clinically, on imaging and pharmacologically, GBA PD is almost identical to idiopathic PD, other than certain features that can be identified in the specialist research setting but not in routine clinical practice. In patients with a known GBA mutation, it is possible to monitor for prodromal signs of PD. The clinical similarity with idiopathic PD and the chance to identify PD at a pre-clinical stage provides a unique opportunity to research therapeutic options for early PD, before major irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms which lead to this increased PD risk in GBA mutation carriers are not fully elucidated. Experimental models to define the molecular mechanisms and test therapeutic options include cell culture, transgenic mice and other in vivo models amenable to genetic manipulation, such as drosophilia. Some key pathological pathways of interest in the context of GBA mutations include alpha synuclein aggregation, lysosomal-autophagy axis changes and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Therapeutic agents that exploit these pathways are being developed and include the small molecule chaperone Ambroxol. This review aims to summarise the main features of GBA-PD and provide insights into the pathological relevance of GBA mutations on molecular pathways and the therapeutic implications for PD resulting from investigation of the role of GBA in PD.

AB  - Background: Depression is common in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) affecting overall outcomes and decreasing quality of life. Although depression in AD is primarily treated with antidepressants, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy and results have been conflicting.
   Objectives: To systematically review evidence on efficacy of antidepressant treatments for depression in AD.
   Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of double blind RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo for depression in AD. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and on line national and international registers. Primary outcomes were treatment response and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were cognition, acceptability, and tolerability. Risk of bias was also assessed.
   Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Three compared sertraline with placebo; one compared both sertraline and mirtazapine to placebo; imipramine, fluoxetine, and clomipramine were evaluated in one study each. In terms of response to treatment (6 studies, 297 patients treated with antidepressants and 223 with placebo), no statistically significant difference between antidepressants and placebo was found (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% CI 0.97-3.92). We found no significant drug-placebo difference for depressive symptoms (5 studies, 311 patients, SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.24). Overall quality of the evidence was moderate because of methodological limitations in studies and the small number of trials.
   Conclusion: Despite the importance of depression in people with AD, few RCTs are available on efficacy of antidepressants, limiting clear conclusions of their potential role. There is a need for further high quality RCTs.

AB  - Objectives. To explore the relationship between insulin levels and nonpsychotic dementia. Methods. Six electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, SCI, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang) were searched from January 1, 2007, to March 1, 2017. Experimental or observational studies that enrolled people with nonpsychotic dementia or abnormal insulin levels in which insulin levels or MMSE scores (events in nonpsychotic dementia) were the outcome measures. Random-effects models were chosen for this meta-analysis. Sample size, mean, s.d., and events were primarily used to generate effect sizes (with the PRIMA registration number CRD42017069860). Results. 50 articles met the final inclusion criteria. Insulin levels in cerebrospinal fluid were lower (Hedges' g = 1.196, 95% CI = 0.238 to 2.514, and P = 0 014), while the levels in peripheral blood were higher in nonpsychotic dementia patients (Hedges' g = 0.853 and 95% CI = 0.579 to 1.127), and MMSE scores were significantly lower in the high insulin group than in the healthy control group (Hedges' g = 0.334, 95% CI = 0.249 to 0.419, and P = 0 000). Conclusions. Our comprehensive results indicate that blood insulin levels may increase in patients with nonpsychotic dementia.

AB  - To achieve long-term goals, organisms evaluate outcomes and expected consequences of their behaviors. Unfavorable decisions maintain many symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD); therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying decision-making in BPD is needed. In this review, the current literature comparing decision-making in patients with BPD versus healthy controls is analyzed.
   Twenty-eight empirical studies were identified through a structured literature search. The effect sizes from studies applying comparable experimental tasks were analyzed.
   It was found that (1) BPD patients discounted delayed rewards more strongly; (2) reversal learning was not significantly altered in BPD; and (3) BPD patients achieved lower net gains in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Current psychotropic medication, sex and differences in age between the patient and control group moderated the IGT outcome. Altered decision-making in a variety of other tasks was supported by a qualitative review.
   In summary, current evidence supports the altered valuation of outcomes in BPD. A multifaceted influence on decision-making and adaptive learning is reflected in this literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Having investigated the influence of acute physical exhaustion on decision-making in world-class elite athletes in Parkin et al. (2017), here a similar method is applied to subelite athletes. These subelite athletes were enrolled on a Team GB talent development program and were undergoing training for possible Olympic competition in 4-8 years. They differ from elite athletes examined previously according to expertise and age. While considered elite (Swann et al., 2015), the subelite athletes had approximately 8 years fewer sporting experience and were yet to obtain sustained success on the international stage. Additionally, the average age of the subelite sample is 20 years; thus, they are still undergoing the behavioral, cognitive, and neuronal changes that occur during the transition from late adolescence to young adulthood (Blakemore and Robbins, 2012). Previous work has used broad definitions of elite status in sport, and as such overlooked different categories within the spectrum of elite athletes (Swann et al., 2015). Therefore it is important to consider subelite athletes as a discrete point on the developmental trajectory of elite sporting expertise.
   Objective: This work aims to investigate the influence of physical pressure on key indicators of decision-making in subelite athletes. It forms part of a wider project examining decision-making across different stages of the developmental trajectory in elite sport. In doing so, it aims to examine how to apply and develop psychological insights useful to an elite sporting environment.
   Methods: 32 subelite athletes (18 males, mean age: 20 years) participated in the study. Performance across three categories of decision-making was assessed under conditions of low and high physical pressure. Decision-making under risk was measured with performance of the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT; Rogers et al., 1999), decision-making under uncertainty with the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002), and fast reactive responses and inhibition via the Stop Signal Reaction Time Task (SSRT; Logan, 1994). Physical exhaustion was induced via intervals of maximal exertion exercise on a wattbike.
   Results: Under pressure subelite athletes showed increased risk taking for both decisions where probability outcomes were explicit (on the CGT), and those where probability outcomes were unknown (on the BART). Despite making quicker decisions under pressure, with fewer errors, on the CGT, subelite athletes showed a reduced ability to optimally adjust betting behavior according to reward and loss contingencies. Fast reactive responses to perceptual stimuli and response inhibition did not change as a result of physical pressure. Individual responses to pressure showed a negative correlation in that a decrease in reaction times on the SSRT Task under pressure was associated with an increase in risk taking on the BART. When assessing the applicability of results based on group averages to individual athletes, 17% of the sample showed an "average" response (within 1 SD of the mean) to pressure across all three decision-making tasks.
   Conclusion: Indicators of decision-making in a sample of subelite athletes are influenced by physical pressure, with a shift toward increased indiscriminate risk taking. The influence that physical pressure has on decision-making was different to that observed in world-class elite athletes; this highlights the importance of distinguishing between athletes at the elite level (Swann et al., 2015). The application of this work to a novel subgroup of elite athletes, including the implementation of a decision-making taxonomy, is discussed.

AB  - The risks military sonar poses to cetaceans received international attention with a highly-publicized mass stranding of Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), and northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Bahamas in 2000. This was the first time that the US Government determined a stranding to be the result of mid-frequency active sonar use. Subsequently attention has been drawn to other mass strandings coincident with naval exercises, including events preceding the 2000 mass stranding. The list of species for which mass strandings have been linked to naval exercises has also increased to include other beaked whales, dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.), pilot whales (Globicephala spp.), several dolphin species (Stenella sp. and Delphinus delphis), and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). In particular, there have been several mass strandings in the northern Indian Ocean coincident with naval exercises including one of the largest (200-250 dolphins)-which have received little attention. Changes in beaked whale behavior, including evasive maneuvering, have been recorded at received levels below <100 dB re 1 mu Pa (rms) and mass stranding may occur at received levels potentially as low as 150-170 dB re mu Pa. There is strong scientific evidence to suggest that a wide range of whale, dolphin and porpoise species can also be impacted by sound produced during military activities, with significant effects occurring at received levels lower than previously predicted. Although there are many stranding events that have occurred coincident with the presence of naval vessels or exercises, it is important to emphasize that even the absence of strandings in a region does not equate to an absence of deaths, i.e. absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. Strandings may be undetected, or be unlikely to be observed because of a lack of search effort or due to coastal topography or characteristics. There may also be "hidden" impacts of sonar and exercises not readily observable (e.g., stress responses). Due to the level of uncertainty related to this issue, ongoing baseline monitoring for cetaceans in exercise areas is important and managers should take a precautionary approach to mitigating impacts and protecting species.

AB  - Substance use disorder (SUD) refers to the detrimental use of psychoactive substances and it is related to a cluster of behavioural, cognitive and physiological dysfunctions indicating that the individual continues using the substance despite significant substance-related problems. Although it is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases affecting society worldwide, the mechanism underlying the vulnerability of certain individuals is not well understood yet. It is now widely accepted that, in addition to genetic factors, environmental adversities during critical stages of development of an organism could also be considered as risk factors that contribute to SUD. It has been suggested that prenatal stress (PS) could play an important role in the causal mechanisms of SUD, since it was shown that PS leads individuals to poor stress management and behavioural problems, both of which increase the risk of SUD. It is widely accepted that gestational stress exposure in rats interferes with the correct progeny development. In particular, research in this field points out that the development of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system is sensitive to disruption by exposure to early stressors. Interestingly, PS induces behavioural abnormalities that are similar to those observed in individuals that present SUD. Since dysfunction of mesocorticolimbic DA pathway has been reported in both prenatally stressed and SUD individuals, in this review we will summarise the current knowledge supporting that PS may serve as a strong candidate to explain the vulnerability of certain individuals to develop SUD following repeated drug exposure. We will also propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain PS-induced changes on mesocorticolimbic DA system.

TI  - Rough Sets, Rough Mereology and Uncertainty
AB  - 35 years ago Zdzislaw Pawlak published the article in which He proposed a novel idea for reasoning about uncertainty. He proposed to present knowledge as classification ability and in consequence the playground for His theory was proposed as approximation space, i.e., a set along with an equivalence relation on it, equivalence classes representing categories to which objects in the set were to be assigned. This point of view was stressed in the monograph 'Rough Sets. Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data' (1992) 25 years ago. The application tint was given to rough sets by transferring center of gravity of the theory from approximation spaces to decision/information systems, i.e., data tables in the attribute-value format. In the same year the first collective monograph appeared accompanying the first workshop on rough sets: 'Intelligent Decision Support. Handbook of Applications and Advances of Rough Set Theory' edited by Roman Slowinski. The effect of those 10 years was emergence of notions like a decision rule, a reduct, a core, of algorithms for finding certain, minimal and optimal rules, for finding reducts, analyses of relations between rough sets and other paradigms describing uncertainty and emergence of hybrid approaches like rough-fuzzy sets etc. Still 10 years elapsed and a monograph on foundations of rough sets was possible (2002): 'Rough Sets. Mathematical Foundations' by this author, and, some other outlines of rough set theory appeared. Rough set research grew, extending its scope by entering realms of morphology, intelligent agents theory, linguistics, behavioral robotics, mereology, granular computing, acquiring many applications in diverse fields. In this chapter we try to sum up our personal experience and results and in a sense to unify them into a coherent conceptual scheme following the main themes of rough set theory: to understand uncertainty and to cope with it in data. In this work, we use the term 'thing' to denote a being in general, denoted with x, y, z, ... and the term 'object' to denote beings in the universes of information/decision systems, denoted u, v, w, ... ; truth values are denoted with letters r, s, ... .

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy remains a key treatment option for severe cases of depression, but undesirable side-effects continue to limit its use. Innovations in the design of novel seizure therapies seek to improve its risk benefit ratio through enhanced control of the focality of stimulation. The design of seizure therapies with increased spatial precision is motivated by avoiding stimulation of deep brain structures implicated in memory retention, including the hippocampus. The development of two innovations in seizure therapyindividualized low-amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), are detailed. iLAST is a method of seizure titration involving reducing current spread in the brain by titrating current amplitude from the traditional fixed amplitudes. MST, which can be used in conjunction with iLAST dosing methods, involves the use of magnetic stimulation to reduce shunting and spreading of current by the scalp occurring during electrical stimulation. Evidence is presented on the rationale for increasing the focality of ECT in hopes of preserving its effectiveness, while reducing cognitive side-effects. Finally, the value of electric field and neural modelling is illustrated to explain observed clinical effects of modifications to ECT technique, and their utility in the rational design of the next generation of seizure therapies.

AB  - Environmental stress factors, such as heavy metals, salinity, and drought, have been increasing steadily over the last few decades, and have negative effects on plant health and productivity. Under such conditions, certain Pseudomonas spp. colonized plant roots or tissue interior can alleviate the effects of environmental stresses on plant by assisting plant nutrition acquisition, modulating plant hormone levels, inducing accumulation of osmolytes and antioxidants, and up or down regulating the growth-related genes in plants. Though such bacteria have shown the potential to improve plant health, in-depth mechanisms through which microbes confer environmental stress tolerance in plants are poorly understood. Thus, further research, for example the role of bacteria on stress-regulated and -responsive mechanisms in plants, particularly at the transcriptome level, will improve our knowledge on plant-microbe interactions and microbe-driven stress tolerance in plants. Similarly, studies on the role of bacteria in multiple-stress amelioration in plants at field conditions will help to identify suitable bioinoculants to improve crop productivity under adverse environmental conditions. In the present review we elaborate on the interactions among plant, plant-beneficial Pseudomonas spp., and various environmental stresses with an objective to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in microbe-mediated stress tolerance in plants.

AB  - The treatment of mine drainage-impacted waters generates considerable amounts of sludge, which raises several concerns, such as storage and disposal, stability, and potential social and environmental impacts. To alleviate the storage and management costs, as well as to give the mine sludge a second life, recovery and reuse have recently become interesting options. In this review, different recovery and reuse options of sludge originating from active and passive treatment of mine drainage are identified and thoroughly discussed, based on available laboratory and field studies. The most valuable products presently recovered from the mine sludge are the iron oxy-hydroxides (ochre). Other by-products include metals, elemental sulfur, and calcium carbonate. Mine sludge reuse includes the removal of contaminants, such as As, P, dye, and rare earth elements. Mine sludge can also be reused as stabilizer for contaminated soil, as fertilizer in agriculture/horticulture, as substitute material in construction, as cover over tailings for acid mine drainage prevention and control, as material to sequester carbon dioxide, and in cement and pigment industries. The review also stresses out some of the current challenges and research needs. Finally, in order to move forward, studies are needed to better estimate the contribution of sludge recovery/reuse to the overall costs of mine water treatment.

KW  - Implementation

KW  - Review
KW  - Shared decision making
KW  - CONSUMER
KW  - PROGRAM
KW  - CARE
AB  - Purpose - This review paper will look at internationally existing publications in the English language on mental health shared decision making (SDM) implementation of a variety of interventions, including different methodologies and research methods, age groups and countries. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of: process, degree and outcomes of implementation; barriers and facilitators; perspectives on implementation by different stakeholders; analysis of the process of implementation in mental health services through the lenses of the normalisation process theory (NPT).
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a targeted literature search the data were analysed in order to provide an overview of methodologies and methods applied in the articles, as well as of the variables listed above. Three different types of information were included: a content analysis of key issues, reflective understanding coming out of participating in implementation of an SDM project in the form of two narratives written by two key participants in an SDM pilot project and an NPT analysis of the process of implementation.
   Findings - Only a minority of mental health SDM research focuses on implementation in everyday practice. It is possible and often desirable to achieve SDM in mental health services; it requires a low level of technology, it can save time once routinized, and it is based on enhancing therapeutic alliance, as well as service users' motivation. Implementation requires an explicit policy decision, a clear procedure, and regular adherence to the aims and methods of implementation by all participants. These necessary and sufficient conditions are rarely met, due to the different levels of commitment to SDM and its process by the different key stakeholders, as well as due to competing providers' objectives and the time allocated to achieving them.
   Originality/value - The review indicates both the need to take into account the complexity of SDM, as well as future strategies for enhancing its implementation in everyday mental health practice. Perhaps because applying SDM reflects a major cultural change in mental health practice, current value attached to SDM among clinicians and service managers would need to be more positive, prominent and enduring to enable a greater degree of implementation.

AB  - Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta, Annelida) are often considered to be typical forestliving organisms, but they are regularly found in agroecosystems of the temperate regions of the world. Although less known than their larger relatives, the earthworms, these saprophagous organisms play similar roles in agricultural soils (but at a smaller scale), e.g., influencing soil structure and organic matter dynamics via microbial communities, and having a central place in soil food webs. Their diversity is rarely studied or often underestimated due to difficulties in distinguishing the species. New genetic techniques reveal that even in anthropogenically highly influenced soils, more than 10 species per site can be found. Because of their close contact with the soil pore water, a high ingestion rate and a thin cuticle, they often react very sensitively to a broad range of pesticides. Firstly we provide a short overview of the diversity and abundance of enchytraeid communities in agroecosystems. Afterwards, we explore the available data on enchytraeid sensitivity toward pesticides at different levels of biological organization, focusing on pesticides used in (mainly) European agroecosystems. Starting with non-standardized studies on the effects of pesticides on the sub-individual level, we compile the results of standard laboratory tests performed following OECD and ISO guidelines as well as those of higher-tier studies (i.e., semi-field and field tests). The number of comparable test data is still limited, because tests with enchytraeids are not a regulatory requirement in the European Union. While focusing on the effects of pesticides, attention is also given to their interactions with environmental stressors (e.g., climate change). In conclusion, we recommend to increase the use of enchytraeids in pesticide risk assessment because of their diversity and functional importance as well as their increasingly simplified use in (mostly standardized) tests at all levels of biological organization.

AB  - Cellular patterning and dislocation bundling as structures of dislocation dynamics in as-grown crystals and epitaxial layers are reviewed. Selected examples of multicrystalline (mc) silicon, III-V and II-VI compounds are presented. The origins of often overlaid dislocation networks varying by the cell scale and cell wall design are reported. The introduction in selected phenomenological fundamentals shows that dynamical polygonization basing on dislocation glide cannot be the only possible formation process. Even at high temperatures the point defect assisted climb plays a decisional role in the dislocation dynamics. Dissipative structuring via non-equilibrium thermodynamics is considered. Reduction of thermo-mechanical stress and control of stoichiometry are practical counter measures. Special attention is paid to the dislocation banding and their pile-up at grain boundaries leading to dislocation bunching. On the other hand at heteroepitaxial processes the controlled banding of dislocations is used to grow out them laterally. Further, second phase inclusions are responsible for dislocation accumulations. Their incorporation must be avoided by good mixing of the fluid phase and composition control. The required bridge intensification between crystal growers and metal physicists as well as the need of in situ experiments and advanced numeric modeling is underlined.

AB  - The involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in different central nervous system (CNS) diseases suggests that this neurotrophin may represent an interesting and reliable therapeutic target. Accordingly, the search for new compounds, also from natural sources, able to modulate BDNF has been increasingly explored. The present review considers the literature on the effects of botanicals on BDNF. Botanicals considered were Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennell, Coffea arabica L., Crocus sativus L., Eleutherococcus senticosus Maxim., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze (green tea), Ginkgo biloba L., Hypericum perforatum L., Olea europaea L. (olive oil), Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, Rhodiola rosea L., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Vitis vinifera L., Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, and Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton. The effect of the active principles responsible for the efficacy of the extracts is reviewed and discussed as well. The high number of articles published (more than one hundred manuscripts for 14 botanicals) supports the growing interest in the use of natural products as BDNF modulators. The studies reported strengthen the hypothesis that botanicals may be considered useful modulators of BDNF in CNS diseases, without high side effects. Further clinical studies are mandatory to confirm botanicals as preventive agents or as useful adjuvant to the pharmacological treatment.

Method: A systematic search of electronic databases was carried out. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a quality assessment tool and comparisons were made with a review of the quality of research on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with IDD. Results: The search yielded 13 papers which provided evidence for the effectiveness but not efficacy of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy; but none were found for psychoanalysis. The quality of the research was generally poor compared to the current research on the effectiveness of CBT. Conclusions: Positive outcomes have been indicated for psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy with people with IDD. Larger scale, more controlled research is necessary to advance the evidence base.

AB  - Institutions are not necessarily good environments for children. In the face of challenges such as HIV, Ebola, poverty, conflict and disaster the numbers have grown rather than reduced. Some countries have closed institutions down -driven by findings that cognitive developmental delay is associated with institutional care. Yet insight into abuse and violence within institutionalised settings is neglected. Maltreatment -violence and abuse -may be an issue. This systematic review series addresses violence and abuse experiences in institutionalised care, exploring firstly the frequency of abuse/violence in institutions, secondly any interventions to reduce such violence or abuse and thirdly the perpetrators of such violence or abuse. The final systematic review updates the findings on cognitive delay associated with institutionalised care. With a violence lens, cognitive delay may well be considered under the umbrella of neglect. Maltreatment and abuse may be a driver of cognitive delay. The keyword search covered several electronic databases and studies were included for data abstraction if they met adequacy criteria. Eight studies were identified on the prevalence of abuse in institutions and a further three studies reported on interventions. Only one study was identified documenting peer on peer violence in institutions. Sixty-six studies were identified examining cognitive development for institutionalised children. All but two of these record cognitive deficits associated with institutionalisation. Only two asked about violence or abuse which was found to be higher in institutionalised children. Overall the abuse experiences of children in institutions are poorly recorded, and in one study violence was associated with high suicidal attempts. The major intervention pathway for ameliorating cognitive challenge seems to be placement out of the institutions which shows benefits and redresses some cognitive outcomes - yet not a total panacea. The single study providing training and monitoring of harsh punishment and maltreatment showed immediate and decided reductions. This data suggest, despite the paucity of studies, violence and abuse, by commission or omission is prevalent in institutions, has an effect on child well-being and is amenable to intervention. Simple training or more complex structures to place children within conducive alternative environments (or to avoid institutionalised placements in the first place) seem to be the main pathway of intervention.

   Method: We present a systematic review of the literature on TEM related to tDCS and TNS treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), conducted in accordance with the recommendations from Cochrane Group and the PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: Our search identified few reported episodes of TEM in the literature. In fact, we found 11 trials focused on treatment of MDD (seven controlled trials of tDCS and four trials of TNS, three open label and one controlled). We highlight the need for safety assessment in clinical research settings to establish with precision and in larger samples the risks inherent to the technique under investigation.
   Conclusion: Safety assessment is of fundamental importance in clinical research. TEM is a very important safety issue in MDD trials. Further and larger controlled trials will help to clarify both the safety and the clinical effects of combinations of pharmacotherapy and tDCS or TNS in daily clinical practice.

AB  - GABA(A) receptors form the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain. This review sets out to summarize the evidence that variations in genes encoding GABA(A) receptor isoforms are associated with aspects of addictive behaviour in humans, while animal models of addictive behaviour also implicate certain subtypes of GABA(A) receptor. In addition to outlining the evidence for the involvement of specific subtypes in addiction, we summarize the particular contributions of these isoforms in control over the functioning of brain circuits, especially the mesolimbic system, and make a first attempt to bring together evidence from several fields to understanding potential involvement of GABA(A) receptor subtypes in addictive behaviour. While the weight of the published literature is on alcohol dependency, the underlying principles outlined are relevant across a number of different aspects of addictive behaviour.

   Methods: We used a systematic approach and performed a literature search of MEDLINE, ISI Web of science, SCOPUS, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases. After identifying 13 eligible reviews addressing interventions of our interest, we proceeded with a narrative description of the study findings.
   Results: The initiatives largely encompassed one-to-one interventions, group activities or community engagement approaches. In particular, technology interventions were recently given much attention. Overall, the studies showed non-satisfying methodological quality and their results were often inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Although there is a growing body of evidence referring to implementation of interventions targeting social isolation and loneliness among the older populations, future well-designed interventions are necessary in order to draw firm conclusions.

AB  - Schizophrenia research has been in a deadlock for many decades. Despite important advances in clinical treatment, there are still major concerns regarding long-term psychosocial reintegration and disease management, biological heterogeneity, unsatisfactory predictors of individual course and treatment strategies, and a confusing variety of controversial theories about its etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms. In the present perspective on schizophrenia research, we first discuss a methodological pitfall in contemporary schizophrenia research inherent in the attempt to link mental phenomena with the brain: we claim that the time-honored phenomenological method of defining mental symptoms should not be contaminated with the naturalistic approach of modern neuroscience. We then describe our Systems Neuroscience of Psychosis (SyNoPsis) project, which aims to overcome this intrinsic problem of psychiatric research. Considering schizophrenia primarily as a disorder of interindividual communication, we developed a neurobiologically informed semiotics of psychotic disorders, as well as an operational clinical rating scale. The novel psychopa-thology allows disentangling the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia into behavioral domains matching the functions of three well-described higher-order corticobasal brain systems involved in interindividual human communication, namely, the limbic, associative, and motor loops, including their corticocortical sensorimotor connections. The results of several empirical studies support the hypothesis that the proposed three-dimensional symptom structure, segregated into the affective, the language, and the motor domain, can be specifically mapped onto structural and functional abnormalities of the respective brain systems. New pathophysiological hypotheses derived from this brain system-oriented approach have helped to develop and improve novel treatment strategies with noninvasive brain stimulation and practicable clinical parameters. In clinical practice, the novel psychopathology allows confining the communication deficits of the individual patient, shifting attention from the symptoms to the intact resources. We have studied this approach and observed important advantages for therapeutic alliances, personalized treatment, and de-escalation strategies. Future studies will further conjoin clinical definitions of psychotic symptoms with brain structures and functions, and disentangle structural and functional deficit patterns within these systems to identify neurobiologically distinct subsyndromes. Neurobiologically homogeneous patient groups may provide new momentum for treatment re-search. Finally, lessons learned from schizophrenia research may contribute to developing a comprehensive perspective on human experience and behavior that integrates methodologically distinct, but internally consistent, insights from humanities and neuroscience.

AB  - Objective: Unemployment is a type of chronic stressor that impacts human health. The reasons for how the stress of unemployment affect health is still a matter of discussion. One of the pathways from chronic stress to ill health is mediated by cortisol, and so we set out to compile extant data on how its secretion is affected by unemployment.
   Design: A systematic literature search was conducted to establish the cortisol dysregulatory effects of this stressor. Main outcome measures: Only studies that specifically examined the effects of unemployment on cortisol excretion, and were written in English were included.
   Results: Ten reports were obtained and synthesised to determine the severity and complexity of the effect of unemployment on cortisol secretion. The resulting combined evidence is mixed in terms of degree or dynamic of relationship.
   Conclusions: The differences between the cumulate findings of the studies can be understood in the context of the lack of both standardised methodology and an absence of consensus on unemployment definition. We propose existing methodologies may be strengthened by acknowledging and accounting for the individual characteristics that may be relevant to the stress experience of unemployment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of workplace accommodations is a proven strategy in supporting individuals with disabilities at work. Accommodations include a wide range of supports and strategies that are not very well defined beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act in the United States. Understanding the landscape of accommodations is important to measure the impact of programs that support employment of individuals with disabilities.
   OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review and thematic analysis of research literature to identify how workplace accommodations are operationalized and to identify knowledge gaps in its conceptualization.
   METHODS: Keywords searches were conducted in seven electronic databases. Title, abstract, and full text screening was conducted followed by a thematic analysis of the content to identify how workplace accommodations are operationalized.
   RESULTS: Overall, 47 studies were selected for review. 433 different types of accommodations were identified, of which assistive technology and specialized equipment represented the most frequently reported type of accommodation (40%). A very small percentage of studies included policy changes (9%) and human assistance (5%) as an accommodation strategy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review aims to clarify how accommodations are operationalized in the research literature. Key knowledge gaps identified include the systematic exclusion of certain types of supports or disability types.

AB  - It is critical for psychiatry as a field to develop approaches to define the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of its brain diseases, especially for serious mental illnesses, and then to use these definitions to generate biologically based disease categories, as well as to explore disease mechanisms and illness etiologies. Our current reliance on phenomenology is inadequate to support exploration of molecular treatment targets and disease formulations, and the leap directly from phenomenology to disease biology has been limiting because of broad heterogeneity within conventional diagnoses. The questions addressed in this review are formulated around how we can use brain biomarkers to achieve disease categories that are biologically based. We have grouped together a series of vignettes as examples of early approaches, all using the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) biomarker database and collaborators, starting off with describing the foundational statistical methods for these goals. We use primarily criterion-free statistics to identify pertinent groups of involved genes related to psychosis as well as symptoms, and finally, to create new biologically based disease cohorts within the psychopathological dimension of psychosis. Although we do not put these results forward as final formulations, they represent a novel effort to rely minimally on phenomenology as a diagnostic tool and to fully embrace brain characteristics of structure, as well as molecular and cellular characteristics and function, to support disease definition in psychosis.

AB  - Several large genome wide association studies have identified a locus in close proximity to the gene encoding the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) to be associated with the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), tentatively suggesting that this enzyme might influence PD pathogenesis. Further support for this comes from the recent identification of a disease-segregating stop codon mutation in ACMSD in a family with Parkinsonism, and a missense mutation in the ACMSD gene predicted to disrupt enzyme function in an individual with typical PD. ACMSD is part of the kynurenine pathway, responsible for the catalytic breakdown of tryptophan into NAD(+), generating several neuroactive metabolites in the process. The enzyme is located at a key branch-point of the pathway, limiting the production of the neurotoxin quinolinic acid, which has excitotoxic and inflammatory properties. In this review, we discuss the genetic findings in light of the functions of ACMSD and its potential involvement in PD pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: In a study aimed at identifying the items carrying information regarding the global severity of depression, the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-6) was derived from the original 17-item version of the scale (HAM-D-17). Since then, the HAM-D-6 has been used in a wide range of clinical studies. We now provide a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of HAM-D-6 in comparison with those of HAM-D-17 and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature in PubMed, Psyclnfo, and EMBASE databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Studies reporting data on the clinimetric validity of the HAM-D-6 and either the HAM-D-17 or MADRS in non-psychotic unipolar or bipolar depression were included in the synthesis. Results: The search identified 681 unique records, of which 51 articles met the inclusion criteria. According to the published literature, HAM-D-6 has proven to be superior to both HAM-D-17 and MADRS in terms of scalability (each item contains unique information regarding syndrome severity), transferability (scalability is constant over time and irrespective of sex, age, and depressive subtypes), and responsiveness ( sensitivity to change in severity during treatment). Conclusions: According to the published literature, the clinimetric properties of HAM-D-6 are superior to those of both the HAM-D-17 and MADRS. Since the validity of HAM-D-6 has been demonstrated in both research and clinical practice, using the scale more consistently would facilitate translation of results from one setting to the other.

AB  - The expression of a last will is legally invalid when the will-maker was in a state preventing him or her from making a decision, or expressing will, in a conscious or independent way; this could occur due to psychiatric disorders, mental retardation, or any other mental activity disturbance, even temporary. There are many problems with medical opinions concerning the validity of last wills. Medical staff play an important and law-rooted role in providing valuable evidence in such cases. The forensic medical literature was searched for topics related to evaluations of last will and testament. Forensic opinions issued by the Forensic Medicine Department, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland, in years 2006-2016 were also examined for cases illustrating the role of physicians and medical files in the legal evaluation of contested wills. This allowed us to conclude that mental status alterations that prevent patients from making last wills in a legally valid way can result from psychiatric or somatic disorders that negatively influencing the level of consciousness. Medical files are a highly valuable and trustworthy source of evidence - especially in the parts authored by medical staff in frequent contact with patients, which includes primary and palliative care physicians or nurses. It is necessary that these files contain remarks on the patient's behavior and ability to function in a home environment, as well as information shared by the patient's relatives. It is crucial that any drugs prescribed and their doses are recorded, and that the actual drugs administered to the patient are also noted.

AB  - The first clinical description of Parkinson's disease (PD) will embrace its two century anniversary in 2017. For the past 30 years, mitochondrial dysfunction has been hypothesized to play a central role in the pathobiology of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. The identifications of mutations in genes encoding PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) and Parkin (E3 ubiquitin ligase) in familial PD and their functional association with mitochondrial quality control provided further support to this hypothesis. Recent research focused mainly on their key involvement in the clearance of damaged mitochondria, a process knownas mitophagy. It has become evident that there are many other aspects of this complex regulated, multifaceted pathway that provides neuroprotection. As such, numerous additional factors that impact PINK1/Parkin have already been identified including genes involved in other forms of PD. A great pathogenic overlap amongst different forms of familial, environmental and even sporadic disease is emerging that potentially converges at the level of mitochondrial quality control. Tremendous efforts now seek to further detail the roles and exploit PINK1 and Parkin, their upstream regulators and downstream signaling pathways for future translation. This review summarizes the latest findings on PINK1/Parkin-directed mitochondrial quality control, its integration and cross-talk with other disease factors and pathways as well as the implications for idiopathic PD. In addition, we highlight novel avenues for the development of biomarkers and disease-modifying therapies that are based on a detailed understanding of the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

Methods Database searches were performed using Web of Science, Pubmed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Embase. After screening 5,563 articles, 35 were identified regarding this topic; 30 contributed data for meta-analyses. Pearson's r correlations were the effect of interest. Omnibus and family functioning domain-specific random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Data are depicted in forest plots. Results A statistically significant association was found between family functioning and child adjustment (patient/siblings) after cancer diagnosis (r = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.13-0.24). Greater family cohesion, expressiveness, and support and less family conflict were each associated with better child adjustment outcomes. Conclusions Family functioning is associated with patient and sibling adjustment after pediatric cancer diagnosis. Limitations in the existing literature preclude strong conclusions about the size of these effects and potential moderators.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic chemicals, recalcitrant to degradation, bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment, causing adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. For this reason, the remediation of PCB-contaminated soils is a primary issue to be addressed. Phytoremediation represents a promising tool for in situ soil remediation, since the available physico-chemical technologies have strong environmental and economic impacts. Plants can extract and metabolize several xenobiotics present in the soil, but their ability to uptake and mineralize PCBs is limited due to the recalcitrance and low bioavailability of these molecules that in turn impedes an efficient remediation of PCB-contaminated soils. Besides plant degradation ability, rhizoremediation takes into account the capability of soil microbes to uptake, attack and degrade pollutants, so it can be seen as the most suitable strategy to clean-up PCB-contaminated soils. Microbes are in fact the key players of PCB degradation, performed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the rhizosphere, microbes and plants positively interact. Microorganisms can promote plant growth under stressed conditions typical of polluted soils. Moreover, in this specific niche, root exudates play a pivotal role by promoting the biphenyl catabolic pathway, responsible for microbial oxidative PCB metabolism, and by improving the overall PCB degradation performance. Besides rhizospheric microbial community, also the endophytic bacteria are involved in pollutant degradation and represent a reservoir of microbial resources to be exploited for bioremediation purposes. Here, focusing on plant-microbe beneficial interactions, we propose a review of the available results on PCB removal from soil obtained combining different plant and microbial species, mainly under simplified conditions like greenhouse experiments. Furthermore, we discuss the potentiality of "omics" approaches to identify PCB-degrading microbes, an aspect of paramount importance to design rhizoremediation strategies working efficiently under different environmental conditions, pointing out the urgency to expand research investigations to field scale.

AB  - Whilst obesity is associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, the influence of weight loss on cognitive function in obese/overweight people is equivocal. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies evaluating the influence of voluntary weight loss on cognitive function in obese/overweight individuals. Articles were acquired from a systematic search of major databases from inception till 01/2016. A xandom effect meta-analysis of weight loss interventions (diet, physical activity, bariatric surgery) on different cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive functions, language and motor speed) was conducted. Twenty studies (13 longitudinal studies = 551 participants; 7 RCTs = 328 treated vs. 140 controls) were included. Weight loss was associated with a significant improvement in attention and memory in both longitudinal studies and RCTs, whereas executive function and language improved in longitudinal and RCT studies, respectively. In conclusion, intentional weight loss in obese/overweight people is associated with improvements in performance across various cognitive domains. Future adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm/refute these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress is the primary cause of lowering of the body's immune status. It arises as a result of intense metabolic processes in humans and animals that involve a decrease in antioxidant enzymes activity at the expense of increased production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, this leads to oxidation of lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA, causing cell proliferation reduction, faster cell aging, and subsequent degradation. Currently, there is a search for methods to maintain an oxidationantioxidant balance. The results of many authors' research point to the effectiveness of the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of various clinical disorders. Numerous studies indicate that, compared to other cells, MSCs have ability to regulate cell adhesion molecules. They also have specific immunogenic and immunosuppressive properties that determine their application in clinical research and regenerative medicine.

AB  - Robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI) are growing fields that may benefit from an expanded perspective stimulated by more interdisciplinary contributions. One way to achieve this goal is to attract non-traditional students from the social sciences and humanities into these fields. This present paper describes two educational initiatives that focused on teaching non-engineering students about robotics and HRI. In one initiative, a group of younger students, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), received hands-on experience with robotics in a context that was not overly technical, while in the other initiative, college students in the social sciences and humanities learned about basic HRI concepts and developed robotics applications. Themes common to both initiatives were to reach non-technical students who are not traditional targets for robotics education and to focus their learning on creating interactive sequences for robots based on key HRI design considerations rather than on the underlying mechanical and electrical details related to how those sequences are enacted inside the robot. Both initiatives were successful in terms of producing desired learning outcomes and fostering participant enjoyment.

AB  - During neurogenesis, specific transcription factors are needed to repress neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells to ensure precise development. Repressor element-1 binding transcription factor (REST), or neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), has been shown to be an important regulator for the establishment of neuronal specificity. It restricts the expression of neuronal genes by binding to the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE/RE1) domain in neuron-specific genes. REST/NRSF regulates many target genes in stem cells, nonneural cells, and neurons, which are involved in neuronal differentiation, axonal growth, vesicular transport, and release as well as ionic conductance. However, it is also regulated by some cytokines/regulators such as epigenetic factors (microRNAs) and even its truncated isoform. REST/NRSF is widely detected in brain regions and has been shown to be highly expressed in nonneuronal cells, but current findings also reveal that, at least in the human brain, it is also highly expressed in neurons and increases with ageing. However, its loss in expression and cytoplasmic translocation seems to play a pivotal role in several human dementias. Additionally, REST/NRSF knockdown leads to malformations in nerve and nonneural tissues and embryonic lethality. Altered REST/NRSF expression has been not only related to deficient brain functions such as neurodegenerative diseases, mental disorders, brain tumors, and neurobehavioral disorders but also highly correlated to brain injuries such as alcoholism and stroke. Encouragingly, several compounds such as valproic acid and X5050 that target REST/NRSF have been shown to be clinically effective at rescuing seizures or Niemann-Pick type C disease. Surprisingly, studies have also shown that REST/NRSF can function as an activator to induce neuronal differentiation. These findings strongly indicate that REST/NRSF is not only a classical repressor to maintain normal neurogenesis, but it is also a fine fundamental protector against neurodegeneration and other disorders and may be a novel potent therapeutic target for neural disturbances.

AB  - Purpose - Much of the existing literature on shared decision making (SDM) in mental health has focused on the use of decision aids (DAs). However, DAs tend to focus on information exchange and neglect other essential elements to SDM in mental health. The purpose of this paper is to expand the review of SDM interventions in mental health by identifying important components, in addition to information exchange, that may contribute to the SDM process in mental health.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a systematic literature search using the Ovid-Medline database with supplementary scoping search of the literature on SDM in mental health treatment. To be eligible for inclusion, studies needed to describe (in a conceptual work or development paper) or evaluate (in any type of research design) a SDM intervention in mental health. The authors included studies of participants with a mental illness facing a mental health care decision, their caregivers, and providers.
   Findings - A final sample of 31 records was systematically selected. Most interventions were developed and/or piloted in the USA for adults in community psychiatric settings. Although information exchange was a central component of the identified studies, important additional elements were: eliciting patient preferences and values, providing patient communication skills training, eliciting shared care planning, facilitating patient motivation, and eliciting patient participation in goal setting.
   Originality/value - The review indicates that additional elements, other than information exchange such as sufficient rapport and trusting relationships, are important and needed as part of SDM in mental health. Future SDM interventions in mental health could consider including techniques that aim to increase patient involvement in activities such as goal settings, values, and preference clarification, or facilitating patient motivation, before and after presenting treatment options.

AB  - Tardive syndrome (TDS) is a potentially permanent and irreversible hyperkinetic movement disorder caused by exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents. Guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology recommend pharmacological first-line treatment for TDS with clonazepam (level B), ginkgo biloba (level B), amantadine (level C), and tetrabenazine (level C). Recently, a class II study provided level C evidence for use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in patients with TDS. Although the precise pathogenesis of TDS remains to be elucidated, the beneficial effects of GPi-DBS in patients with TDS suggest that the disease may be a basal ganglia disorder. In addition to recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of TDS, this article introduces the current use of DBS in the treatment of medically intractable TDS.

AB  - Aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), is the key etiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other alpha-synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Various triggers for pathological alpha-syn aggregation have been elucidated, including post-translational modifications, oxidative stress, and binding of metal ions, such as calcium. Raised neuronal calcium levels in PD may occur due to mitochondria' dysfunction and/or may relate to calcium channel dysregulation or the reduced expression of the neuronal calcium buffering protein, calbindin-D28k. Recent results on human tissue and a mouse oxidative stress model show that neuronal calbindin-D28k expression excludes alpha-syn inclusion bodies. Previously, cell culture model studies have shown that transient increases of intracellular free Ca(II), such as by opening of the voltage-gated plasma calcium channels, could induce cytoplasmic aggregates of a-syn. Raised intracellular free calcium and oxidative stress also act cooperatively to promote alpha-syn aggregation. The association between raised neuronal calcium, alpha-syn aggregation, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity is reviewed in the context of neurodegenerative alpha-syn disease and potential mechanism based therapies.

AB  - Levodopa is the most effective medication for motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, various motor and non-motor complications are associated with levodopa treatment, resulting from altered levodopa-dopamine metabolism with disease progression and long-term use of the drug. The present review emphasizes the role of monoamine transporters other than the dopamine transporter in uptake of extracellular dopamine in the dopamine-denervated striatum. When dopaminergic neurons are lost and dopamine transporters decreased, serotonin and norepinephrine transporters compensate by increasing uptake of excessive extracellular dopamine in the striatum. Organic cation transporter-3 and plasma membrane monoamine transporter, low affinity, and high capacity transporters, also potentially uptake dopamine when high-affinity transporters do not work normally. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are often administered to patients with Parkinson's disease presenting with depression, pain or other non-motor symptoms. Thus, it is important to address the potential of these drugs to modify dopamine metabolism and uptake through blockade of the compensatory function of these transporters, which could lead to changes in motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Introduction: Although informal coercion is frequently applied in psychiatry, its use is discussed controversially. This systematic review aimed to summarize literature on attitudes toward informal coercion, its prevalence, and clinical effects.
   Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsyclNF, and Google Scholar was conducted. Publications were included if they reported original data describing patients' and clinicians' attitudes toward and prevalence rates or clinical effects of informal coercion.
   Results: Twenty-one publications out of a total of 162 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most publications focused on leverage and inducements rather than persuasion and threat. Prevalence rates of informal coercion were 29-59%, comparable on different study sites and in different settings. The majority of mental health professionals as well as one-third to two-third of the psychiatric patients had positive attitudes, even if there was personal experience of informal coercion. We found no study evaluating the clinical effect of informal coercion in an experimental study design.
   Discussion: Cultural and ethical aspects are associated with the attitudes and prevalence rates. The clinical effect of informal coercion remains unclear and further studies are needed to evaluate these interventions and the effect on therapeutic relationship and clinical outcome. It can be hypothesized that informal coercion may lead to better adherence and clinical outcome but also to strains in the therapeutic relationship. It is recommendable to establish structured education about informal coercion and sensitize mental health professionals for its potential for adverse effects in clinical routine practice.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) is known to maintain and improve neurocognitive health. However, there is still a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which PA exerts its effects on the brain and cognition in humans. Many of the most widely discussed mechanisms of PA are molecular and cellular and arise from animal models. While information about basic cellular and molecular mechanisms is an important foundation from which to build our understanding of how PA promotes cognitive health in humans, there are other pathways that could play a role in this relationship. For example, PA-induced changes to cellular and molecular pathways likely initiate changes to macroscopic properties of the brain and/or to behavior that in turn influence cognition. The present review uses a more macroscopic lens to identify potential brain and behavioral/socioemotional mediators of the association between PA and cognitive function. We first summarize what is known regarding cellular and molecular mechanisms, and then devote the remainder of the review to discussing evidence for brain systems and behavioral/socioemotional pathways by which PA influences cognition. It is our hope that discussing mechanisms at multiple levels of analysis will stimulate the field to examine both brain and behavioral mediators. Doing so is important, as it could lead to a more complete characterization of the processes by which PA influences neurocognitive function, as well as a greater variety of targets for modifying neurocognitive function in clinical contexts.

   Methods Online and hand searches were conducted to identify papers published between 1980 and 2015 on psychodynamic treatments delivered to adults with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED).
   Results A total of 47 studies were finally included in this review. Fifteen studies were available for AN, 9 for BN, 12 for BED, and 11 for samples with mixed diagnoses. Several methodological flaws emerged, but overall psychodynamic interventions showed promising results at the end of treatment and follow-up, when available.
   Conclusions The body of literature on psychodynamic treatments is sparse and sometimes methodologically questionable; nevertheless, current data provide support to the effectiveness of these interventions, particularly for AN. However, both a defined approach (focus, themes, and techniques) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted to clarify the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapies.

AB  - Objective: Clinical experience suggests a growing prevalence of borderline personality disorder in aged residential care and psychiatric facilities with attendant difficulties in their management. This paper reviews the literature concerning the prevalence, phenomenology and diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in old age. The aim is to elucidate the phenomenological differences in old age and thus improve identification of the disorder.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases, employing the search terms including 'personality disorder', 'borderline personality disorder', 'aged care', 'gerontology', 'geriatric psychiatry' and 'life span'. The search included articles in English involving participants 65+ years. Long-term prospective studies of borderline personality disorder, long-term follow-up studies and studies involving older adults from 50+ years were also examined.
   Results: There is a paucity of literature on borderline personality disorder in the elderly. No diagnostic or rating instruments have been developed for borderline personality disorder in the elderly. The phenomenology of borderline personality disorder in the aged population differs in several respects from that seen in younger adults, causing some of the difficulties in reaching a diagnosis. Escalations of symptoms and maladaptive behaviours usually occur when the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is either not made or delayed. Improved identification of borderline personality disorder in older patients, together with staff education concerning the phenomenology, aetiology and management of these patients, is urgently needed.
   Conclusion: Diagnostic instruments for borderline personality disorder in the elderly need to be developed. In the interim, suggestions are offered concerning patient symptoms and behaviours that could trigger psychiatric assessment and advice concerning management. A screening tool is proposed to assist in the timely diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in older people. Timely identification of these patients is needed so that they can receive the skilled help, understanding and treatment needed to alleviate suffering in the twilight of their lives.

AB  - Memories of threatening, fear-evoking events can persist even over a lifetime. While fear memory is widely considered to be a highly persistent and durable form of memory, its circuits are not. This article reviews the dynamic temporal representation of remote fear memory in the brain, at the level of local circuits and distributed networks. Data from the study of Pavlovian cued fear conditioning suggests memory retrieval remains amygdala-dependent, even over protracted time scales, all the while interconnected cortical and subcortical circuits are newly recruited and progressively reorganized. A deeper understanding into how the neurocircuitry of cued fear memory reorganizes with the passage of time will advance our ongoing search for the elusive physical changes representing fear memories in the brain. Considering that persistent, pathological fear memories are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the behavioral and circuit-level study of remote cued fear memory retrieval adds a key element towards a systems understanding of PTSD.

AB  - Urbanization is modifying previously pristine natural habitats and creating "new" ecosystems for wildlife. As a result, some animals now use habitat fragments or have colonized urban areas. Such animals are exposed to novel stimuli that they have not been exposed to in their evolutionary history. Some species have adapted to the challenges they face-a phenomenon known as synurbanization-while others have not. Here we present a review of the sublethal consequences of life in the city for wild vertebrates, and demonstrate that urban animals face an almost completely different set of physiological and behavioural challenges compared to their rural counterparts. We focus on the negative fitness-related impacts of urbanization, but also identify instances where there are benefits to wildlife. The effects of urbanization appear to be both species-and context-dependent, suggesting that although the field of urban ecology is far from nascent, we are still just beginning to understand how the intricacies of biodiversity on our planet are affected by our presence.

AB  - Findings in the field of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience have shed new light on our understanding of the psychological and biological bases of morality. Although a lot of attention has been devoted to understanding the processes that underlie complex moral dilemmas, attempts to represent the way in which individuals generate moral judgments when processing basic harmful actions are rare. Here, we will outline a model of morality which proposes that the evaluation of basic harmful actions relies on complex interactions between emotional arousal, Theory of Mind (ToM) capacities, and inhibitory control resources. This model makes clear predictions regarding the cognitive processes underlying the development of and ability to generate moral judgments. We draw on data from developmental and cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopathology research to evaluate the model and propose several conceptual and methodological improvements that are needed to further advance our understanding of moral cognition and its development.

AB  - The anterior medial temporal lobes are one of the most studied parts of the brain. Classically, their two main structures the amygdalae and the hippocampi have been linked to key cognitive and affective functions, related in particular to learning and memory. Based on abundant evidence, we will argue for an alternative but complementary point of view: they may also play a major role in food intake and body weight regulation. First, an overview is given of early clinical evidence in this line of thought. Subsequently, empirical evidence is presented on how food intake, including in the extreme case of obesity, may relate to amygdalian and hippocampal functioning. The focus is on the amygdala's role in processing the relevance of food stimuli, cue-induced feeding, and stress-induced eating and on the hippocampus' involvement in the use of interoceptive signals of hunger and satiety, as well as memory and inhibitory processes related to food intake. Additionally, an elaboration takes place on possible reciprocal links between food intake, body weight, and amygdala and hippocampus functioning. Finally, issues that seemed particularly critical for figure research in the field are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cardiovascular and nervous systems are deeply connected during development, health, and disease. Both systems affect and regulate the development of each other during embryogenesis and the early postnatal period. Specialized neural crest cells contribute to cardiac structures, and a number of growth factors released from the cardiac tissue (e.g., glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, nerve growth factor, Neurotrophin-3) ensure proper maturation of the incoming parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons. Physiologically, the cardiovascular and nervous systems operate in harmony to adapt to various physical and emotional conditions to maintain homeostasis through sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Moreover, neurocardiac regulation involves a neuroaxis consisting of cortex, amygdala, and other subcortical structures, which have the ability to modify lower-level neurons in the hierarchy. Given the interconnectivity of cardiac and neural systems, when one undergoes pathological changes, the other is affected to a certain extent. In addition, there are specific neurocardiac diseases that affect both systems simultaneously, such as Huntington disease, Lewy body diseases, Friedreich ataxia, congenital heart diseases, Danon disease, and Timothy syndrome. Over the last decade, in vitro modeling of neurocardiac diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided an invaluable opportunity to elevate our knowledge about the brain-heart connection, since previously primary cardiomyocytes and neurons had been extremely difficult to maintain long-term in vitro. Ultimately, the ability of iPSC technology to model abnormal functional phenotypes of human neurocardiac disorders, combined with the ease of therapeutic screening using this approach, will transform patient care through personalized medicine in the future.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are often considered to be genetic. They are characterized by unificational behavioral abnormalities which are classified in two basic domains: social relations and social communication, and restricted and repetitive pattern of behaviors and activity. Clinical research has evidenced that genetic and environmental factors play a major role in the development of ASD, and it is contemplated to be a multifactorial as well. Augmentation in the field of molecular genetics and neuroscience allows the pharmacologist to explore more features of ASDs using genetic, humanoid, and nonhumanoid models. Hence, the present review was undertaken to elucidate the major concepts associated with the models of ASD, such as gene or chromosome incrimination; face, predict, and construct validities; behavioral assays; and advantages and disadvantages of preclinical models along with constrains in developing genetic models for ASD.

AB  - Background: High uptake of vaccinations is crucial for disease prevention. Although overall uptake of childhood immunisations is high in the United Kingdom (UK), pockets of lower uptake remain. Novel systematic methods have not been employed when reviewing the qualitative literature examining parents' vaccination decisions.
   Aims: We aimed to conduct a qualitative systematic review of studies in the UK to understand factors influencing parental decisions to vaccinate a child.
   Methods: On 12/2/14 we searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL plus, Embase, Social Policy and Practice and Web of Science for studies using qualitative methods and reporting reasons why parents in the UK had or had not immunised their child. Participant quotes and authors' interpretations of qualitative data were extracted from the results of articles. Thematic synthesis was used to develop higher-order themes (conducted in 2015).
   Results: 34 papers were included. Two types of decision-making had been adopted: non-deliberative and deliberative. With non-deliberative decisions parents felt they had no choice, were happy to comply and/or relied on social norms. Deliberative decisions involved weighing up the risks and benefits, considering others' advice/experiences and social judgement. Emotions affected deliberative decision-making. Trust in information and vaccine stakeholders was integral to all decision-making. Practical issues affected those who intended to vaccinate.
   Conclusions: Parents adopted two different approaches to decision-making about childhood vaccinations. By understanding more about the mechanisms underpinning parents' vaccination behaviour, in collaboration with vaccine stakeholders, we can better design interventions to enhance informed uptake.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that primarily afflicts the elderly. It is characterized by motor dysfunction due to extensive neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. There are multiple biological processes that are negatively impacted during the pathogenesis of PD, and are implicated in the cell death in this region. Neuroinflammation is evidently involved in PD pathology and mitigating the inflammatory cascade has been a therapeutic strategy. Age is the number one risk factor for PD and thus needs to be considered in the context of disease pathology. Here, we discuss the role of neuroinflammation within the context of aging as it applies to the development of PD, and the potential for two representative compounds, fractalkine and astaxanthin, to attenuate the pathophysiology that modulates neurodegeneration that occurs in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by severe and persistent impairments in interpersonal functioning. Given the complexity of social interactions, studying the interactive behavior of BPD patients is challenging. One way to implement both tight experimental control and realistic, externally valid settings is to use game-theoretical experiments. This review discusses findings from economic exchange studies in BPD against the background of game-theoretical literature. BPD patients do not seem to derive utility from mutual cooperation with others and appear not to "forgive" a partner's unfairness. By pursuing a strategy of negative reciprocity, BPD patients seem to act mostly "rationally" and in their own self-interest. Their "grim trigger strategy" resembles the theoretical ideal of the rational and self interested agent homo economicus. Finally, we summarize how research findings from economics and clinical psychiatry may be mutually enriching and propose new research ideas in this fascinating field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Evidence about relationship between antidepressant use during pregnancy and the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically assess this relationship. To identify relevant studies, we conducted systematic searches in PubMed and Embase of articles published through May 2016. Random-effects models were adopted to estimate overall relative risk. In total, eight studies involving more than 40,000 PPH cases were included in our meta-analysis. After pooling the estimates, the odds for developing PPH were 1.32 -fold higher (risk ratio, RR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.17-1.48) in antidepressant users compared with individuals who had not taken antidepressants. In subgroup analyses, the associations still exist for women with exposure to non-SRI (RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.1-1.56), SRIs (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.06-1.44), SSRIs (RR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.04 -1.38), and SNRIs (RR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.41-1.85). Based on exposure window, we found an increased risk of PPH among current (RR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09-1.71) and recent users (RR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.15 -1.51), but not past users (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.88-1.31). The findings of this meta-analysis support an increased risk of PPH in women exposure to antidepressant during late gestation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the overproduction and incorporation of free radicals and the dynamic ability of a biosystem to detoxify reactive intermediates. Free radicals produced by oxidative stress are one of the common features in several experimental models of diseases. Free radicals affect both the structure and function of neural cells, and contribute to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although the precise mechanisms that result in the degeneration of neurons and the relevant pathological changes remain unclear, the crucial role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is associated with several proteins (such as a-synuclein, DJ-1, Amyloid (3 and tau protein) and some signaling pathways (such as extracellular regulated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) that are tightly associated with the neural damage. In this review, we present evidence, gathered over the last decade, concerning a variety of pathogenic proteins, their important signaling pathways and pathogenic mechanisms associated with oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Proper control and regulation of these proteins' functions and the related signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic approach to the patients. We also emphasizes antioxidative options, including some new neuroprotective agents that eliminate excess reactive oxygen species efficiently and have a certain therapeutic effect; however, controversy surrounds some of them in terms of the dose and length of therapy. These agents require further investigation by clinical application in patients suffering Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The last review on teacher enthusiasm was 45 years ago, and teacher enthusiasm remains a compelling yet complex variable in the educational context. Since Rosenshine's (School Review 78:499-514, 1970) review, the conceptualizations, definitions, methodology, and results have only become more scattered, and several related constructs have emerged that may or may not be synonymous with teacher enthusiasm. In this review, we delve into the past four decades of teacher enthusiasm research to provide a potential starting point for a new, consolidated direction in teacher enthusiasm research based on a proposed, holistic definition of enthusiasm which brings together research from the past and can fuel research for the future. We begin by reviewing definitions of teacher enthusiasm and related constructs and, thereafter, put forward a new and integrative definition of teacher enthusiasm that combines the two most prevalent conceptualizations of the construct, namely experienced enjoyment and expressive behavior. Bearing our proposed definition in mind, we go on to present numerous measures that assess teacher enthusiasm, detail research evidence related to its correlates, and finally derive several research implications that, when considered in future research, promise to advance the field.

AB  - Equine-assisted therapy (EAT) is a therapeutic technique that has been examined for improving physical, emotional, social, cognitive, educational, and behavioral skills in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This literature review examines the usefulness of the approach for children diagnosed with ASD. The goal of the search strategy used was to include relevant scientific articles published examining EAT for children diagnosed with ASD. Of the 12 studies examined, 11 researchers demonstrated efficacy for increased physical and social functioning, communication, sensory sensitivity, sensory motivation, self-regulation, adaptive skills, motor skills, improved volition, as well as decreased aberrant behavior and severity of symptoms. The majority of the research documented improvements in functioning; however, these conclusions were qualified by numerous factors that limit the interpretation of the results.

AB  - This scoping review investigates if, over the last 25 years in high resource countries, midwives' patients of low socioeconomic position (SEP) were at more or less risk of adverse infant birth outcomes compared to physicians' patients. Reviewers identified 917 records in a search of 12 databases, grey literature, and citation lists. Thirty-one full documents were assessed and nine studies met inclusion criteria. Eight studies were assessed as moderate in quality; one study was given a weak rating. Of the moderate quality studies, the majority found no statistical difference in outcomes according to model of care for preterm birth, low or very low birth weight, or NICU admission. No study reported a statistically significant difference for small for gestational age birth (2 studies), or mean or low Apgar score (4 studies). However, one study found a reduced risk of preterm birth (AOR=0.70, p < 0.01), and heavier mean infant birth weight (3325 g vs. 3282 g, p < 0.01) for midwifery patients. Another study reported lower risk of low (RR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.73) and very low birthweight (RR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.85) for midwifery care. And, a third study reported a decrease in stays (1-3 days) in NICU (Adjusted Risk Difference= - 1.8, 95% CI: -3.9, 0.2) for midwifery patients, though no overall difference in NICU admission of any duration. Other studies reported significant differences favoring midwifery care for mean birth weight (3598 g vs. 3407.3 g, p < 0.05; 3233 g vs. 3089 g, p < 0.05; 2 studies) and very low birth weight (OR=0.35, 95% CI:0.1, 0.9), for sub-groups within the larger study populations. This scoping review documented heterogeneity in study designs and analytical methods, inconsistent findings, moderate methodological quality, and lack of currency. There is a need for new studies to definitively establish if and how a midwifery-led model of care influences birth outcomes for women of low SEP. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed evaluations testing the effectiveness of positive youth development (PYD) interventions for reducing violence in young people.
   Methods Two reviewers working independently screened records, assessed full-text studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes were transformed to Cohen's d. Quality assessment of included evaluations was undertaken using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Effect sizes were combined using multilevel meta-analysis. We searched 21 databases, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and CENTRAL, and hand-searched key journals and websites. We included studies where the majority of participants were aged 11-18 years and where interventions were delivered in community (not clinical or judicial) settings outside of normal school hours. We excluded studies targeting predefined physical and mental health conditions or parents/carers alongside young people. We defined violence as perpetration or victimisation of physical violence including violent crime.
   Results Three randomised trials were included in this systematic review. Included evaluations each had design flaws. Meta-analyses suggested that PYD interventions did not have a statistically significant effect on violence outcomes across all time points (d=0.021, 95% CI -0.050 to 0.093), though interventions did have a statistically significant short-term effect (d=0.076, 95% CI 0.013 to 0.140).
   Conclusions Our meta-analyses do not offer evidence of PYD interventions in general having effects of public health significance in reducing violence among young people. Evaluations did not consistently report theories of change or implementation fidelity, so it is unclear if our meta-analyses provide evidence that the PYD theory of change is ineffective in reducing violence among young people.

AB  - Background: In India, it is estimated that similar to 16,000 farmers die by suicide each year, and at rates far above those of the general population. This paper reviews much of the literature concerning the factors associated with this crisis.
   Methods: A literature search was undertaken from multiple databases on Ovid, as well as more elementary searches of Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed. This paper presents a review of the key results.
   Results: Socioeconomic factors, rather than mental health problems, are associated with farmer suicides, with increased indebtedness playing the predominant role. Available research suggests this has arisen to a greater extent recently, due to an agrarian crisis affecting the most vulnerable farmers. This has multiple manifestations, including a lack of agricultural investment and irrigation improvement, use of cash crops, the increased use of noninstitutional credit sources, and the reduction of trade barriers. Bt cotton is unlikely to be an important factor and no studies reported a significant burden of mental health problems.
   Conclusion: Indebtedness and numerous factors relating to this are clearly identified as the most important risk factors. Further large-scale assessments are required to further understand the situation. (C) 2016 Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia, Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Immunological factors are increasingly recognized as being important in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to summarize the disperse and often conflicting literature on the potential association between autoimmune diseases (ADs) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for original studies evaluating the relationship between ADs and OCD/tic disorders until July, 13th 2016. Seventy-four studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were of limited methodological quality. Rates of OCD were higher in rheumatic fever patients who were also affected by its neurological manifestation, Sydenham's chorea. The literature on other ADs was scarce and the findings inconclusive. Few studies examined the association between ADs and tic disorders. A handful of family studies reported elevated rates of ADs in first-degree relatives of individuals with OCD/tic disorders, and vice versa, potentially suggesting shared genetic and/or environmental mechanisms. In conclusion, at present, there is modest evidence for a possible association and familial co-aggregation between ADs and OCD/tic disorders. We offer some suggestions for future research.

This review describes incorrect and misleading statements from within the report, omissions and conflict of interest, which make it unsuitable for health risk assessment. The executive summary and overall conclusions did not accurately reflect the scientific evidence available. Independence is needed from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), the group that set the exposure guidelines being assessed. This conflict of interest critically needs to be addressed for the forthcoming World Health Organisation (WHO) Environmental Health Criteria Monograph on Radiofrequency Fields. Decision makers, organisations and individuals require accurate information about the safety of RF electromagnetic signals if they are to be able to fulfil their safeguarding responsibilities and protect those for whom they have legal responsibility.

AB  - School-based suicide prevention programs are one of the key strategies to address suicide in adolescence. The number of programs increased rapidly during the 1980s and was largely designed for high school- or middle school-aged students (11-18 years old), due to the vulnerable time and predictive risk of future suicidal ideation or health problems in later life. However, key recommendations from these studies are often obscured by the volume of such programs, resulting in significant challenges for program designers. This study aimed to undertake a review of the numerous suicide prevention programs implemented globally in recent years to provide informed recommendations for the development of effective school-based programs for adolescents. The study employed a scoping review process to enable the deconstruction of large or complex issues to promote comprehension and ease of interpretation. A search of online international databases using combinations of key words (variations in 'suicide,' 'school,' 'program,' and 'prevention') within a specified time frame (January 2010 to June 2015) identified 397 articles. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used to identify relevant articles at each stage of the review process, resulting in a total of 20 studies addressing 13 different school programs. Results were presented using established program categories (as education/awareness, gatekeeper, peer leadership, skills, screening/assessment) and informed ten recommendations that address the design, content, delivery, and review of school-based suicide prevention programs for adolescents.

AB  - Epidemiological studies in the Netherlands have reported an excessive gender gap in the risk for non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) among immigrants from Morocco with a higher risk elevation in males compared to females. We examined the consistency of these findings and their generalizability to immigrants from the Maghreb (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) in other European countries.
   Systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline, PsychINFO and EMBASE databases were searched for publications in the period from January 1970 to April 2014. We included incidence and prevalence studies of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) among migrants from the Maghreb in Europe and studies of subclinical psychotic symptoms (SPS) in representative samples. A meta-analysis was performed on the subgroup of incidence studies.
   Five incidence and three prevalence studies of NAPD, and two prevalence studies of SPS, conducted in the Netherlands (n=7), Belgium (n=1), France (n=1) and Italy (n=1) met our inclusion criteria. Across all research designs, the risks of NAPD and SPS were consistently increased among male, not female immigrants from the Maghreb. The meta-analysis of incidence studies of NAPD yielded male-to-female risk ratios of 5.1 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.1-8.4] for migrants from the Maghreb, 2.0 (95 % CI 1.6-2.5) for other migrant groups, and 1.8 (95 % CI 1.3-2.5) for non-migrant Europeans.
   The marked gender gap in psychosis risk among migrants from the Maghreb appears a consistent finding, foremost among the Moroccan-Dutch. The small number of studies limits the strength of conclusions that can be drawn about countries other than the Netherlands. Achievement-expectation mismatch, social marginalization and an increased prevalence of illicit drug use are possible explanations.

AB  - Background: Prevalence estimates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among breast cancer patients varied widely in existing studies. This study aimed to provide an overall prevalence estimate of PTSD among breast cancer patients, and the prevalence estimates related to specific PTSD diagnosis tools.
   Methods: Systematic search of relevant articles was made from seven databases. Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation was used to estimate the overall prevalence of PTSD. Sub-group and meta-regression analyses were used to investigate the between-study sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was examined using Egger's funnel plot and Begg test.
   Results: The pooled prevalence of PTSD among breast cancer patients was [9.6%, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)= 7.9-11.5%]. Studies that used Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-Form (CAPS) method alone yielded much higher prevalence (19.0%, 95% CI= 13.1-25.5%, n= 5) than three or fourth edition Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (SCID) method alone (3.0%, 95% CI= 2.2-3.9%, n= 11). Prevalence estimates for studies that used the methods: PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) cut-off, PCL-C cluster, and Impact of Event Scale (IES) cut-off were (7.0%, 95% CI= 3.9-10.8%, n= 10), (11.5%, 95% CI= 8.6-15.6%, n= 11) and (15.1%, 95% CI= 12.3-18.2%, n= 4), respectively. Heterogeneity between-study was substantial (I-2= 44.9-92.3%).
   Conclusion: About 9.6% of the breast cancer patients would develop the PTSD symptoms. Those who were younger, non-Caucasian and recently completed treatment would be at a greater risk of developing PTSD.

AB  - miRNAs play important roles in modulating gene expression in varying cellular processes and disease pathogenesis, including neurodegenerative diseases. Several miRNAs are expressed in the brain, control brain development and are identified as important biomarkers in the pathogenesis of motor and neuro-cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These remarkable miRNAs could be used as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targeting potential for many stressful and untreatable progressive neurodegenerative diseases. To modulate these miRNA activities, there are currently two strategies involved; first one is to therapeutically restore the suppressed miRNA level by miRNA mimics (agonist), and the other one is to inhibit miRNA function by using anti-miR (antagonist) to repress overactive miRNA function. However, RNAi-based therapeutics often faces in vivo instability because naked nucleic acids are subject to enzyme degradation before reaching the target sites. Therefore, an effective, safe and stable bio-responsive delivery system is necessary to protect the nucleic acids from serum degradation and assist their entrance to the cells. Since neuronal cells are non-regenerating, to design engineered miRNAs to be delivered to the central nervous system (CNS) for long term gene expression and knockdown is representing an enormous challenge for scientists. This article provides an insight summary on some of the innovative strategies employed to deliver miRNA into target cells. These viral and non-viral carrier systems hold promise in RNA therapy delivery for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The combined effect of fundamental results about neurocognitive processes and advancements in decoding mental states from ongoing brain signals has brought forth a whole range of potential neurotechnological applications. In this article, we review our developments in this area and put them into perspective. These examples cover a wide range of maturity levels with respect to their applicability. While we assume we are still a long way away from integrating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology in general interaction with computers, or from implementing neurotechnological measures in safety-critical workplaces, results have already now been obtained involving a BCI as research tool. In this article, we discuss the reasons why, in some of the prospective application domains, considerable effort is still required to make the systems ready to deal with the full complexity of the real world.

AB  - Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) possess remarkable physicochemical characteristics suitable for different applications in medicine, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, energy, cosmetics and electronics. Because of their ultra fine size and high surface reactivity, ENMs can enter plant cells and interact with intracellular structures and metabolic pathways which may produce toxicity or promote plant growth and development by diverse mechanisms. Depending on their type and concentration, ENMs can have positive or negative effects on photosynthesis, photochemical fluorescence and quantum yield as well as photosynthetic pigments status of the plants. Some studies have shown that ENMs can improve photosynthetic efficiency via increasing chlorophyll content and light absorption and also broadening the spectrum of captured light, suggesting that photosynthesis can be nano-engineered for harnessing more solar energy. Both up- and down-regulation of primary metabolites such as proteins and carbohydrates have been observed following exposure of plants to various ENMs. The potential capacity of ENMs for changing the rate of primary metabolites lies in their close relationship with activation and biosynthesis of the key enzymes. Several classes of secondary metabolites such as phenolics, flavonoids, and alkaloids have been shown to be induced (mostly accompanied by stress-related factors) in plants exposed to different ENMs, highlighting their great potential as elicitors to enhance both quantity and quality of biologically active secondary metabolites. Considering reports on both positive and negative effects of ENMs on plant metabolism, in-depth studies are warranted to figure out the most appropriate ENMs (type, size and optimal concentration) in order to achieve the desirable effect on specific metabolites in a given plant species. In this review, we summarize the studies performed on the impacts of ENMs on biosynthesis of plant primary and secondary metabolites and mention the research gaps that currently exist in this field.

KW  - STATEMENT
AB  - Background: Firefighting is a highly stressful occupation with unique physical challenges, apparel and environments that increase the potential for dehydration. Dehydration leaves the firefighter at risk of harm to their health, safety and performance. The purpose of this review was to critically analyse the current literature investigating the impact of fighting 'live' fires on firefighter hydration.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed of four electronic databases for relevant published studies investigating the impact of live fire suppression on firefighter hydration. Study eligibility was assessed using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included studies were critically appraised using the Downs and Black protocol and graded according to the Kennelly grading system.
   Results: Ten studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. The average score for methodological quality was 55 %, ranging from 50 % ('fair' quality) to 61 % ('good' quality) with a 'substantial agreement' between raters (k = .772). Wildfire suppression was considered in five studies and structural fire suppression in five studies. Results varied across the studies, reflecting variations in outcome measures, hydration protocols and interventions. Three studies reported significant indicators of dehydration resulting from structural fire suppression, while two studies found mixed results, with some measures indicating dehydration and other measures an unchanged hydration status. Three studies found non-significant changes in hydration resulting from wildfire firefighting and two studies found significant improvements in markers of hydration. Ad libitum fluid intake was a common factor across the studies finding no, or less severe, dehydration.
   Conclusions: The evidence confirms that structural and wildfire firefighting can cause dehydration. Ad libitum drinking may be sufficient to maintain hydration in many wildfire environments but possibly not during intense, longer duration, hot structural fire operations. Future high quality research better quantifying the effects of these influences on the degree of dehydration is required to inform policies and procedures that ensure firefighter health and safety.

AB  - Dystonias represent a heterogeneous group of movement disorders responsible for sustained muscle contraction, abnormal postures, and muscle twists. It can affect focal or segmental body parts or be generalized. Primary dystonia is the most common form of dystonia but it can also be secondary to metabolic or structural dysfunction, the consequence of a drug's side-effect or of genetic origin. The pathophysiology is still not elucidated. Based on lesion studies, dystonia has been regarded as a pure motor dysfunction of the basal ganglia loop. However, basal ganglia lesions do not consistently produce dystonia and lesions outside basal ganglia can lead to dystonia; mild sensory abnormalities have been reported in the dystonic limb and imaging studies have shown involvement of multiple other brain regions including the cerebellum and the cerebral motor, premotor and sensorimotor cortices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique of brain stimulation with a magnetic field applied over the cortex allowing investigation of cortical excitability. Hyperexcitability of contralateral motor cortex has been suggested to be the trigger of focal dystonia. High or low frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) can induce excitatory or inhibitory lasting effects beyond the time of stimulation and protocols have been developed having either a positive or a negative effect on cortical excitability and associated with prevention of cell death, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons mediated inhibition and brain-derived neurotrophic factor modulation. rTMS studies as a therapeutic strategy of dystonia have been conducted to modulate the cerebral areas involved in the disease. Especially, when applied on the contralateral (pre)-motor cortex or supplementary motor area of brains of small cohorts of dystonic patients, rTMS has shown a beneficial transient clinical effect in association with restrained motor cortex excitability. TMS is currently a valuable tool to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia but large controlled studies using sham stimulation are still necessary to delineate the place of rTMS in the therapeutic strategy of dystonia. In this review, we will focus successively on the use of TMS as a tool to better understand pathophysiology, and the use of rTMS as a therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Formally, availability of education for children has increased around the world over the last decades. However, despite having a successful formal education career, adults can become functional illiterates. Functional illiteracy means that a person cannot use reading, writing, and calculation skills for his/her own and the community's development. Functional illiteracy has considerable negative effects not only on personal development, but also in economic and social terms. Although functional illiteracy has been highly publicized in mass media in the recent years, there is limited scientific knowledge about the people termed functional illiterates; definition, assessment, and differential diagnoses with respect to related numerical and linguistic impairments are rarely studied and controversial. The first goal of our review is to give a comprehensive overview of the research on functional illiteracy by describing gaps in knowledge within the field and to outline and address the basic questions concerning who can be considered as functional illiterates: (1) Do they possess basic skills? (2) In which abilities do they have the largest deficits? (3) Are numerical and linguistic deficits related? (4) What is the fundamental reason for their difficulties? (5) Are there main differences between functional illiterates, illiterates, and dyslexics? We will see that despite partial evidence, there is still much research needed to answer these questions. Secondly, we emphasize the timeliness for a new and more precise definition that results in uniform sampling, better diagnosis, conclusion, and intervention. We propose the following working definition as the result of the review: functional illiteracy is the incapability to understand complex texts despite adequate schooling, age, language skills, elementary reading skills, and IQ. These inabilities must also not be fully explained by sensory, domain-general cognitive, neurological or mental disorders. In sum, we suggest that functional illiteracy must be more thoroughly understood and assessed from a theoretical, empirical, and diagnostic perspective.

AB  - The presence of only small amounts of misfolded protein is an indication of a healthy proteome. Maintaining proteome health, or more specifically, "proteostasis," is the purview of the "proteostasis network." This network must respond to constant fluctuations in the amount of destabilized proteins caused by errors in protein synthesis and exposure to acute proteotoxic conditions. Aging is associated with a gradual increase in damaged and misfolded protein, which places additional stress on the machinery of the proteostasis network. In fact, despite the ability of the proteostasis machinery to readjust its stoichiometry in an attempt to maintain homeostasis, the capacity of cells to buffer against misfolding is strikingly limited. Therefore, subtle changes in the folding environment that occur during aging can significantly impact the health of the proteome. This decline and eventual collapse in proteostasis is most pronounced in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease that are caused by the misfolding, aggregation, and toxicity of certain proteins. This review discusses how C. elegans models of protein misfolding have contributed to our current understanding of the proteostasis network, its buffering capacity, and its regulation.

AB  - The purpose of this review was to systematically search and critically analyse the literature pertaining to behavioural outcomes of exercise interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder aged 16years. This systematic review employed a comprehensive peer-reviewed search strategy, two-stage screening process and rigorous critical appraisal, which resulted in the inclusion of 13 studies. Results demonstrated that exercise interventions consisting individually of jogging, horseback riding, martial arts, swimming or yoga/dance can result in improvements to numerous behavioural outcomes including stereotypic behaviours, social-emotional functioning, cognition and attention. Horseback riding and martial arts interventions may produce the greatest results with moderate to large effect sizes, respectively. Future research with well-controlled designs, standardized assessments, larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-ups is necessary, in addition to a greater focus on early childhood (aged 0-5years) and adolescence (aged 12-16years), to better understand the extent of the behavioural benefits that exercise may provide these populations.

AB  - Objective: Medication non-adherence following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to identify psychosocial factors associated with medication adherence in patients with ACS.
   Methods: A search of electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, ASSIA, OpenGrey, EthOS and WorldCat) was undertaken to identify relevant articles published in English between 2000 and 2014. Articles were screened against our inclusion criteria and data on study design, sample characteristics, predictors, outcomes, analyses, key findings and study limitations were abstracted.
   Results: Our search identified 3609 records, of which 17 articles met our inclusion criteria (15 independent studies). Eight out of ten studies found an association between depression and non-adherence. A meta analysis revealed that depressed patients were twice as likely to be non-adherent compared to patients without depression (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 157-333, p = 0.015). Type D personality was found to predict non-adherence in both studies in which it was measured. Three out of three studies reported that treatment beliefs based on the Necessity-Concerns Framework predicted medication non-adherence and there was some evidence that social support was associated with better adherence. There was insufficient data to meta-analyse all other psychosocial factors identified.
   Conclusion: There was some evidence that psychosocial factors, particularly depression, were associated with medication adherence following ACS. Targeting depressive symptoms, screening for Type D personality, challenging maladaptive treatment beliefs, and providing better social support for patients may be useful strategies to improve medication adherence.
