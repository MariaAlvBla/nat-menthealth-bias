AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate levels and effects of trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn), PAHs and PCBs in mussels and fish native to the Lagoon of Venice. To this end, bioaccumulation and various biomarkers of generic stress and exposure (malondialdehyde, MDA and metallothioneins, MT; ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, EROD; fluorescent bile metabolites and somatic indices in fish; lysosomal membrane stability, LMS; lipofuscins, LF; neutral lipids, NL and survival-in-air, SOS in mussels) were measured in organisms seasonally collected from two differently influenced areas.
   In mussels, metal bioaccumulation levels at the two sites were low and fluctuated similarly, exhibiting decreasing levels in summer, like MDA and MT. Micro-organic pollutants and the probably related biological response of LMS did not show either significant site differences or seasonal trends. LF and NL revealed inconclusive patterns. The results of the survival-in-air test were quite erratic, showing that they were associated with the high variability of both natural and physiological parameters temperature, food, reproduction, and body reserve cycle.
   In fish, both inorganic and organic micropollutant levels were low, and differences were detected between sites only for PCBs. The pattern exhibited by micro-organic contaminants was clearly related to the reproductive cycle at both sites; a relationship with PCBs, EROD and MDA was established at the site where their levels were generally higher. Bile metabolites (3-OH benzo(a)pyrene, 1-OH pyrene) were associated with PAH contents. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dopaminergic synaptic function may be assessed either at the presynaptic terminal or at the postsynaptic binding sites using molecular in vivo imaging methods. Apart from the density of binding sites, parameters such as alterations in dopamine synthesis, dopamine storage or dopamine release can be quantified either by application of specific radiotracers or by assessing the competition between the exogenous radioligand and endogenous dopamine. Investigations of humans in both clinical and experimental settings have yielded evidence that disturbances of dopaminergic function may be associated with numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions, among which are movement disorders, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and drug abuse. This article gives an overview of those studies, which so far have been performed on dopaminergic neurotransmission in humans using in vivo imaging methods. We focus on disease-related deficiencies within the functional entity of the dopaminergic synapse. Taken together, in vivo findings yield evidence of presynaptic dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease with decreases in striatal dopamine synthesis, dopamine storage, dopamine release and dopamine transporter binding. In contrast, 'Parkinson Plus' syndromes (multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies) are characterized by both pre- and postsynaptic deficiencies with reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis, dopamine storage, dopamine release, and dopamine transporter, as well as D-1 and D-2 receptor binding. In patients with Huntington's disease, postsynaptic dysfunctions with reductions of striatal D-1 and D-2 receptor binding have become apparent, whereas attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is mainly characterized by presynaptic deficits with increases in dopamine transporter binding. Interestingly, findings are also consistent with respect to drug abuse: cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate, heroin, alcohol and nicotine invariably act via enhancement of dopamine release in dorsal and/or ventral striatal regions. In vivo findings additionally suggest that not only D-2 receptor binding but also the extent of dopamine release is lower in individuals with a history of drug abuse. Findings become inconsistent with increasing complexities of psychiatric conditions. As yet, there is no clear evidence as to the contributions of the individual presynaptic and postsynaptic constituents of the dopaminergic synapse to the pathophysiologies of schizophrenia and depression. As these diseases can be conceived as the result of a variety of dysfunctions and dysregulations within an intricate network of neurotransmitter systems, regional investigations of one single pre- or postsynaptic constituent may not reach far enough to disentagle the interrelationships between the constituents of one let alone a variety of neurotransmitter systems.

AB  - Brain damage as a result of hyperthermia or heat-stress has been the focus of attention in many areas of neuroscience in recent years. Heat-induced alterations in structural components of the central nervous system (CNS) will obviously also influence the relevant transmitter systems, which may be involved in a variety of different behaviors. Indeed, many studies have indicated that excitatory amino acids, and monoaminergic and peptidergic systems are affected during hyperthermia. This chapter will address past and current research on various neuropeptides that have been implicated in the consequences of hyperthermia and various other heat disorders. However, considering the large and even increasing number of identified neuroactive peptides, it is necessary to limit this chapter to a few peptides or peptide systems, which have received particular attention in relation to hyperthermia. Among these are the opioid peptides, the tachykinins, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and peptides belonging to the angiotensin system. Most of these neuropeptides are not only affected by hyperthermia and abnormal alterations in the body temperature but also are involved in the endogenous mechanisms of regulating body temperature. This review does not endeavor to fully cover the field but it does aim to give the reader an idea of how various neuropeptides may be involved in the control of body heat and how peptidergic systems are affected during various thermal changes, including both immediate and long-term consequences.

TI  - Age and gender differences of psychogenic fever: a review of the Japanese literature
AB  - Background: Psychogenic fever is one of the most common psychosomatic diseases. Patients with psychogenic fever have acute or persistent body temperature above normal range in psychologically stressful situations. In spite of numerous case reports on psychogenic fever, there are few epidemiological studies. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the age distribution and gender differences of psychogenic fever in Japan.
   Methods: To achieve this goal, we searched Medline and Ichushi WEB, a Japanese medical database, and added other publications that were not included in these databases. Thus, we reviewed 195 Japanese cases of psychogenic fever published in 62 papers.
   Results: Psychogenic fever patients ranged from 3 to 56 years old, with the highest number of cases occurring in 13 year-olds in both sexes. The male: female ratio of 1: 1.19 suggested a slight predominance of female cases. Psychogenic fever accounted for 18% of fever cases of unknown origin in children and 2-6% of the psychosomatic diseases of pediatric patients. Patients with psychogenic fever were not only found in pediatrics departments, but also in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry, internal medicine, anesthesiology, dentistry, and obstetrics/gynecology departments.
   Conclusion: The age of psychogenic fever patients ranged from 3 to 56 years old and the male: female ratio was 1:1.19. Psychogenic fever is seen especially in adolescence in Japan.

AB  - We review the progress made in the field of object recognition over the past two decades. Structural-description models, making their appearance in the early 1980s, inspired a wealth of empirical research. Moving to the 1990s, psychophysical evidence for view-based accounts of recognition challenged some of the fundamental assumptions of structural-description theories. The 1990s also saw increased interest in the neurophysiological study of high-level visual cortex, the results of which provide some constraints on how objects may be represented. By 2000, neuroimaging arose as a viable means for connecting neurons to behavior. One of the most striking fMRI results has been category selectivity, which provided further constraints for models of object recognition. Despite this progress, the field is still faced with the challenge of developing a comprehensive theory that integrates this ever-increasing body of results and explains how we perceive and recognize objects.

AB  - As Titchener pointed out more than one hundred years ago, attention is at the center of the psychological enterprise. Attention research investigates how voluntary control and subjective experience arise from and regulate our behavior. In recent years, attention has been one of the fastest growing of all fields within cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. This review examines attention as characterized by linking common neural networks with individual differences in their efficient utilization. The development of attentional networks is partly specified by genes, but is also open to specific experiences through the actions of caregivers and the culture. We believe that the connection between neural networks, genes, and socialization provides a common approach to all aspects of human cognition and emotion. Pursuit of this approach can provide a basis for psychology that unifies social, cultural, differential, experimental, and physiological areas, and allows normal development to serve as a baseline for understanding various forms of pathology. D.O. Hebb proposed this approach 50 years ago in his volume Organization of Rebavzor and continued with introductory textbooks that dealt with all of the topics of psychology in a common framework. Use of a common network approach to psychological science may allow a foundation for predicting and understanding human behavior in its varied forms.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (social phobia, SAnD) is a chronic, impairing disorder characterised by embarrassment and fear relating to public scrutiny and social performance. In its generalised form it may seem to be a type of extreme shyness or variant of avoidant personality disorder and thus enduring and resistant to change. A discrete subtype has been seen as akin to simple phobia and potentially responsive to behavioural therapies.
   In this article we critically evaluate the pharmacological regimens that have been used to treat social anxiety disorder. An extensive search was conducted from 1980 through to June 2006. Electronic databases were used including Medline and PsycInfo using search terms including anxiety or phobia with social or treatment or therapeutics, restricted to English language manuscripts. The results of this search are presented by drug category, sorted according to both common clinical practice and strength of evidence.
   There are effective, well-tolerated, and powerful drug treatments of social anxiety disorder. A significant evidence base supports this assertion. Medication therapy should be considered as a first line treatment of this condition.

AB  - Neurophysiological evidence is described showing that some neurons in the macaque inferior temporal visual cortex have responses that are invariant with respect to the position, size and view of faces and objects, and that these neurons show rapid processing and rapid learning. Which face or object is present is encoded using a distributed representation in which each neuron conveys independent information in its firing rate, with little information evident in the relative time of firing of different neurons. This ensemble encoding has the advantages of maximising the information in the representation useful for discrimination between stimuli using a simple weighted sum of the neuronal firing by the receiving neurons, generalisation and graceful degradation. These invariant representations are ideally suited to provide the inputs to brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that learn the reinforcement associations of an individual's face, for then the learning, and the appropriate social and emotional responses, generalise to other views of the same face. A theory is described of how such invariant representations may be produced in a hierarchically organised set of visual cortical areas with convergent connectivity. The theory proposes that neurons in these visual areas use a modified Hebb synaptic modification rule with a short-term memory trace to capture whatever can be captured at each stage that is invariant about objects as the objects change in retinal view, position, size and rotation. Another population of neurons in the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus encodes other aspects of faces such as face expression, eye gaze, face view and whether the head is moving. These neurons thus provide important additional inputs to parts of the brain such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that are involved in social communication and emotional behaviour.
   Outputs of these systems reach the amygdala, in which face-selective neurons are found, and also the orbitofrontal cortex, in which some neurons are tuned to face identity and others to face expression. In humans, activation of the orbitofrontal cortex is found when a change of face expression acts as a social signal that behaviour should change; and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can impair face and voice expression identification, and also the reversal of emotional behaviour that normally occurs when reinforcers are reversed.

AB  - Many lesion studies report an amazing variety of deficits in behavioral functions that cannot possibly be encoded in great detail by the relativelv small number of midbrain dopamine neurons. Although hoping to unravel a single dopamine function underlying these phenomena, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies still give a confusing, mutually exclusive, and partly contradictory account of dopamine's role in behavior. However, tile speed of observed phasic dopamine changes varies several thousand fold, which offers a means to differentiate the behavioral relationships according to their time courses. Thus dopamine is involved in mediating the reactivity of the organism to the environment at different time scales, from fast impulse responses related to reward via slower changes with uncertainty, punishment, and possibly movement to the tonic enabling of postsynaptic motor, cognitive, and motivational systems deficient in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral mesodiencephalon are essential for the control of voluntary movement and the regulation of emotion, and are severely affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recent advances in molecular biology and mouse genetics have helped to unravel the mechanisms involved in the development of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons, including their specification, migration and differentiation, as well as the processes that govern axonal pathfinding and their specific patterns of connectivity and maintenance. Here, we follow the developmental path of these neurons with the goal of generating a molecular code that could be exploited in cell-replacement strategies to treat diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review the effectiveness of co-therapy compared with monotherapy for people with bipolar mania.
   Method: MEDLINE, Embase, Psychinfo, The Cochrane Library and reference lists of retrieved studies were searched without language restrictions for randomized controlled trials evaluating co-therapy compared with monotherapy for acute bipolar mania. Each trial was assessed for susceptibility to bias. Data on mania outcomes, withdrawals, extrapyramidal symptoms and weight were extracted and pooled effect estimates summarized as relative risks (RR) or differences in mean values (MD) where appropriate.
   Results: Eight eligible studies were included (1124 participants). Significant reductions in mania (Young Mania Rating Scale, YMRS) scores were shown for haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine as co-therapy compared with monotherapy with a mood stabilizer. For atypical antipsychotics combined, the pooled difference in mean scores was 4.41 (95% CI: 2.74, 6.07). Significantly more participants on co-therapy met the response criterion (at least 50% reduction in YMRS score), RR 1.53 (1.31, 1.80). With some drugs, co-therapy decreased tolerability compared with monotherapy, and resulted in greater weight gain. There were insufficient data to compare one co-therapy regimen with another.
   Conclusion: The addition of antipsychotic treatment to established mood-stabilizer treatment is more effective than mood-stabilizer treatment alone.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to review the current state of evidence for types of case management, focusing on the last 10 years since publication of the Cochrane Systematic Reviews of case management and assertive community treatment. A literature review of electronic databases from 1995 to the present to identify recent research on psychiatric case management, both original studies and reviews, was carried out. Original articles were organized on basis of year of study, experimental group and outcome variables to determine patterns. Sixty relevant papers were located. Thirty-nine are reports of experimental trials of types of case management and 21 are reviews or discussion papers. The focus of research is on assertive community treatment or intensive case management, with only five papers on other forms of less intense case management. Numerous outcomes have been examined, of those examined often enough to draw meaningful conclusions only one, engagement with services, has been consistently positive. All other outcomes have produced mixed results. The strength of findings in favour of case management has weakened over time. A heterogeneous group of experimental designs limits comparisons. Numerous issues with methodology and definitions of types of case management have beset research in this field. Assertive types of case management (including assertive community treatment and intensive case management) are more effective than standard case management in reducing total number of days spent in hospital, improving engagement, compliance, independent living and patient satisfaction. More important than the type of service configuration is to understand the clinical criteria of the services provided and their effectiveness. Key words: assertive community treatment, case management, community mental health services.

AB  - Hemispheric asymmetry in emotional perception has been traditionally studied for basic emotions and very little is known about laterality for more complex social emotions. Here, we used the "redundant target paradigm" to investigate interhemispheric asymmetry and cooperation for two social emotions in healthy subjects. Facial expressions of flirtatiousness or arrogance were briefly presented either unilaterally in the left (LVF) or right visual field (RVF), or simultaneously to both visual fields (BVF) while participants responded to the target expression (flirtatious or arrogant, counterbalanced between blocks). In bilateral conditions the faces could show the same emotion (congruent condition) or two different expressions (incongruent condition). No difference between unilateral presentations was found, suggesting that the perception of social emotions is not hemispherically lateralized. Responses were faster and more accurate in bilateral displays with two emotionally congruent but physically different faces (i.e., a male and a female expressing the same emotion) than in unilateral conditions. This "redundant target effect" was consistent with a neural summation model, thereby showing that interhemispheric cooperation may occur for social emotions despite major perceptual differences between faces posing the same expression.

AB  - There is a growing policy imperative to promote positive mental health as well as prevent the development of mental health problems in children. This paper summarises the findings of published systematic reviews evaluating such interventions. A search was undertaken of ten electronic databases using a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and free text searches. Systematic reviews covering mental health promotion or mental illness prevention interventions aimed at infants, children or young people up to age 19 were included. Reviews of drug and alcohol prevention programmes and programmes to prevent childhood abuse and neglect were excluded because these have been the subject of recent good quality reviews of reviews. A total of 27 systematic reviews were included. These targeted a range of risk and protective factors, and a range of populations (including parents and children). While many lacked methodological rigour, overall the evidence is strongly suggestive of the effectiveness of a range of interventions in promoting positive mental well-being, and reducing key risk factors for mental illness in children. Based on this evidence, arguments are advanced for the preferential provision of early preventive programmes.

AB  - Background: Computer-guided therapy is an innovative treatment strategy that could have an important role in the future of psychological treatment. This paper summarises the available published evidence that assesses the effectiveness of a computerised cognitive behaviour therapy ( CCBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD). Methods: Fifteen electronic bibliographic databases including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Biological Abstracts, HMIC and NHS CRD databases were comprehensively searched in March 2004: ['obsessive compulsive disorder' ( text and indexed terms)] AND ['cognitive therapy' ( text and indexed terms)] AND ['computer' ( text and indexed terms)]. Reference lists of included studies, guidelines, generic research, trials registers and specialist mental health sites were hand-searched. Results: The search produced 149 citations from which we identified two RCTs and two single-arm studies with relevant data. All four studies used one software programme - BTSteps. In the large RCT, YBOCS effect sizes for BTSteps, therapist-led cognitive behaviour therapy ( TCBT) and relaxation ( RLX) were 0.84, 1.22, and 0.35, respectively. The smaller RCT found significantly better outcomes with brief scheduled support compared to brief on-demand phone support. Conclusions: BTSteps was as good as TCBT for reducing time spent in rituals and obsessions and for improving the Work and Social Adjustment Scale ( WSA), and was superior to RLX treatment. The available evidence also showed that improvement of OCD persisted beyond the end of CCBT. TCBT was more effective than CCBT for all patients overall though not in those who went on to start self-exposure. Such a system has the potential to widen the access to CBT in general and considerably shorten clinician-guided care. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Objective: To review the evidence from research relevant to participation in physical activity and exercise in Greece.
   Method: Systematic search of peer-reviewed literature.
   Results: No such previous review was found for Greece. Thus, its originality should provide valuable information. Selected publications included 36 papers, published between 1993 and 2006, concerning 15 studies. Most studies investigated exercise, sports and leisure-time physical activity but total and occupational physical activity was also studied.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of physical activity and exercise in Greece was found to be low in the 1990s and 2000s, both in absolute and comparable terms. However, recent data reveal the development of a more active profile. The main reasons for participation were health, weight control, fitness and stress management, while lack of time was the main perceived barrier. Influencing factors were age, gender, income, type of work, marital status, residence and educational background. Recommendations include specific policies, strategies and campaigns to be addressed to the general public aiming at increasing participation rates. Future researchers should focus more on longitudinal and intervention studies.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) provide a major integrative system of the forebrain involved in the organization of goal-directed behaviour. Pathological alteration of BG function leads to major motor and cognitive impairments such as observed in Parkinson's disease. Recent advances in BG research stress the role of neural oscillations and synchronization in the normal and pathological function of BG. As demonstrated in several brain structures, these patterns of neural activity can emerge from electrically coupled neuronal networks. This review aims at addressing the presence, functionality and putative role of electrical synapses in BG, with a particular emphasis on the striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), two main BG nuclei in which the existence and functional properties of neuronal coupling are best documented.

AB  - Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a developmental disorder characterized by motor and verbal tics. The tics, which are fast and involuntary, result from frontal/basal-ganglia abnormalities that lead to unsuppressed behaviors. Language has not been carefully examined in TS. We tested the processing of two basic aspects of language: idiosyncratic and rule-governed linguistic knowledge. Evidence suggests that idiosyncratic knowledge (e.g., in irregular past tense formation; bring-brought) is stored in a mental lexicon that depends on the temporal-lobe-based declarative memory system that also underlies conceptual knowledge. In contrast, evidence suggests that rule-governed combination (e.g., in regular past tenses; walk+ -ed) takes place in a mental grammar that relies on the frontal/basal-ganglia-based procedural memory system, which also underlies motor skills such as how to use a hammer. We found that TS children were significantly faster than typically developing control children in producing rule-governed past tenses (slip-slipped, plim-plimmed, bring-bringed) but not irregular and other unpredictable past tenses (bring-brought, splim-splam). They were also faster than controls in naming pictures of manipulated (hammer) but not non-manipulated (elephant) items. These data were not explained by a wide range of potentially confounding subject- and item-level factors. The results suggest that the processing of procedurally based knowledge, both of grammar and of manipulated objects, is particularly speeded in TS. The frontal/basal-ganglia abnormalities may thus lead not only to tics, but also to a wider range of rapid behaviors, including the cognitive processing of rule-governed forms in language and other types of procedural knowledge.

AB  - More than half a century has passed since the publication of George Kelly's (1955/1991) The Psychology of Personal Constructs. This review considers the elaboration of personal construct psychology (PCP) during this time, both by Kelly and by others who developed his ideas. Advances to the theory have principally concerned implicative relationships between constructs, construing of the self, social relationships, emotions, links with other approaches, and supporting research. With regard to methods of assessment of construing, major developments have occurred in both repertory grid and non-grid techniques, such as laddering. The principal advances in the applications of PCP have been in the clinical, educational, and organizational fields, but have by no means been limited to these areas. It can be concluded that PCP has met Kelly's own design specifications for a useful theory and that PCP can perhaps anticipate at least another half-century of elaboration.

AB  - Youth violence is recognized as a major public health problem in the United States and the world. Over the past ten years, progress has been made in documenting the factors that contribute to violent behavior. Emerging research is deepening our understanding of the individual and societal influences that contribute to and protect against youth violence. However, much work still remains to be done in this field, both in examining potential causes and in designing effective intervention strategies. This chapter highlights specific dimensions of youth violence prevention selected by the authors because these dimensions are the focus of public attention, are emerging as critical issues in the study of youth violence, or have a unique place in the current political and social context. We focus on the developmental pathways to violence, factors that mediate and moderate youth violence, the role of culture and media in youth violence, school-based violence such as school shootings and bullying, and the training of health care professionals.

AB  - In this autobiographical essay, I trace the origins of my passion for communicating with the public about mental health and the behavioral sciences and make a case for spreading such passion among psychologists. I also describe the circuitous route that led to my unlikely 4-year tenure as editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine and describe some of the inner workings of this New York-based, commercial enterprise-formerly the property of the American Psychological Association. I made some progress in that role to return the magazine to its scientific origins, providing an outlet for hundreds of scientists and practitioners to speak directly to millions of Americans about their work. This is an essential task, I argue, if our field is to flourish. I also detail my departure as editor-in-chief of Psychology Today and describe the magazine's rapid return to "pop'' status. Media sources do not automatically welcome participation by clinicians or behavioral scientists. Through a contingency analysis, I suggest ways of improving our ability to interface successfully with media professionals.

   Methods The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords.
   Results From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive.
   Conclusions Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

AB  - In recent years, the phosphoinositide- 3- kinase/ Akt cell survival signaling pathway has been increasingly researched in the field of stroke. Akt activity is suggested to be upregulated by phosphorylation through the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors. Although the upstream signaling components phosphoinositide- dependent protein kinase ( PDK) 1 and integrin-linked kinase enhance the activity of Akt, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ( PTEN) decreases it. Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates an array of molecules, including glycogen synthase kinase3 beta ( GSK3 beta), forkhead homolog in rhabdomyosarcoma ( FKHR), and Bcl- 2- associated death protein, thereby blocking mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activity. Generally, the level of Akt phosphorylation at site Ser 473 ( P- Akt) transiently increases after focal ischemia, whereas the levels of phosphorylation of PTEN, PDK1, forkhead transcription factor, and GSK3 beta decrease. Numerous compounds ( such as growth factors, estrogen, free radical scavengers, and other neuroprotectants) reduce ischemic damage, possibly by upregulating P- Akt. However, preconditioning and hypothermia block ischemic damage by inhibiting an increase of P- Akt. Inhibition of the Akt pathway blocks the protective effect of preconditioning and hypothermia, suggesting the Akt pathway contributes to their protective effects and that the P- Akt level does not represent its true kinase activity. Together, attenuation of the Akt pathway dysfunction contributes to neuronal survival after stroke.

AB  - Adenosine is arguably the most potent and widespread presynaptic modulator in the CNS, yet adenosine receptor signal transduction pathways remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which adenosine A(1) receptor stimulation leads to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) activation and contributes to the inhibition of synaptic transmission. Western blot analysis indicated that selective A1 receptor activation [ with N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA)] resulted in rapid increases in phosphorylated p38 (phosphop38) MAPK immunoreactivity in membrane fractions, and decreases in phospho-p38 MAPK in cytosolic fractions. Immunoprecipitation with a phospho-p38 MAPK antibody revealed constitutive association of this phosphoprotein with adenosine A(1) receptors. Phospho-p38 MAPK activation by A1 receptor stimulation induced translocation of PP2a ( protein phosphatase 2a) to the membrane. We then examined the actions of p38 MAPK activation in A(1) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition. Excitatory postsynaptic field potentials evoked in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus markedly decreased in response to adenosine (10 mu M), the A(1) receptor agonist CPA (40 nM), or a 5 min exposure to hypoxia. These inhibitory responses were mediated by A1 receptor activation because the selective antagonist DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine) (100 nM) prevented them. In agreement with the biochemical analysis, the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H- imidazole] (25 mu M) blocked the inhibitory actions of A1 receptor activation, whereas both the inactive analog SB202474 [4-ethyl-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-5-(4'-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole] (25 mu M) and the ERK 1/2 ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) MAPK inhibitor PD98059 [2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone] (50 mu M) were ineffective. In contrast, the p38 MAPK inhibitors did not inhibit GABAB- mediated synaptic depression. These data suggest A1 receptor-mediated p38 MAPK activation is a crucial step underlying the presynaptic inhibitory effect of adenosine on CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission.

AB  - The mammalian subiculum plays a prominent role in inhibition of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Lesion and stimulation studies indicate that the hippocampus, acting via output neurons of the ventral subiculum, acts to attenuate stress-induced glucocorticoid release. Lesions of the ventral subiculum enhance glucocorticoid secretion following psychogenic, but not systemic stressors, indicating that the influence of this structure on the HPA system is stressor-specific. Anatomical analyses fail to demonstrate direct interactions of the subiculum with principal stress-effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus, consistent with a trans-synaptic mechanism of action. Accordingly, tracing data indicate that glutamatergic ventral subiculum neurons innervate GABAergic neurons in several paraventricular nucleus-projecting neurons in the hypothalamus and basal forebrain, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by glutamate-GABA relays. The subiculum also innervates several limbic forebrain structures that in turn have bisynaptic projections to paraventricular neurons, such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and lateral septum, suggesting that the subiculum may have a generalized up-stream influence on limbic stress integration. Finally, recent information suggests that the subiculum may also be stress excitatory under some circumstances, and that there may be substantial strain or individual differences in the net contribution of the subiculum, to stress integration. Overall, the present state of knowledge indicates that the role of the subiculum in stress integration is complex, and likely involves interactions of stress-relevant subicular output with limbic-hypothalamic stress-integrative circuits.

AB  - Background: There have been several reports of successful psychosocial interventions for children with selective mutism (SM), a disorder in which a child consistently fails to speak in one or more social settings (e.g., school) despite speaking normally in other settings (e.g., home). The present literature review was undertaken in order to provide an up-to-date summary and critique of the SM treatment literature published in the past fifteen years. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify SM treatment studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and 2005. Results: A total of 23 studies were included in the present review. Of these, ten used a behavioral/cognitive behavioral approach, one used a behavioral language training approach, one used a family systems approach, five used a psychodynamic approach, and six used multimodal approaches to SM treatment. Conclusion: Although much of this literature is limited by methodological weaknesses, the existing research provides support for the use of behavioral and cognitive-behavioral interventions. Multimodal treatments also appear promising, but the essential components of these interventions have yet to be established. An outline of a cognitive-behavioral treatment package for a typical SM child is provided and the review concludes with suggestions for future research.

AB  - Objective: In schizophrenia, cognitive dysfunctions commonly affect attention, memory and executive function, interfere with functional outcome and remain difficult to treat. Previous studies have implicated the cholinergic system in cognitive functioning. In Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic agonists have shown modest clinical benefits on cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Impaired cholinergic activity might also be involved in schizophrenia. Hence the role of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) as adjunctive therapy is under study. We aimed to review the literature and evaluate the overall effectiveness of ChEI adjunctive therapy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Methods: We conducted a computer-based search using PubMed (up to February 15, 2006) and ISI Web of Science (conference proceeding abstracts from January 2003 to December 2005) databases. We used the search terms "schizophrenia," "cognition or memory" and "tacrine or donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine." Studies included were critically analyzed for allocation, blindness, duration and study design, demographic data, and clinical and neuropsychological outcome assessments. We excluded studies that involved patients with psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia-spectrum or if they involved animals or molecular investigations. We also excluded conference proceeding abstracts with no explicit neuropsychological battery and/or results. Results: Data on ChEI as adjunctive therapy for the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are sparse and so far derived from small samples and mostly open uncontrolled studies. ChEI's potential in long-term management has barely been documented and remains to be fully explored. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence on whether ChEI should be used for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, further studies with appropriate trial designs and outcome measures in homogenous schizophrenia populations are warranted.

AB  - A basic problem of visual perception is how human beings recognize objects after spatial transformations. Three central classes of findings have to be accounted for: (a) Recognition performance varies systematically with orientation, size, and position; (b) recognition latencies are sequentially additive, suggesting analogue transformation processes; and (c) orientation and size congruency effects indicate that recognition involves the adjustment of a reference frame. All 3 classes of findings can be explained by a transformational framework of recognition: Recognition is achieved by an analogue transformation of a perceptual coordinate system that aligns memory and input representations. Coordinate transformations can be implemented neurocomputationally by gain (amplitude) modulation and may be regarded as a general processing principle of the visual cortex.

AB  - Objective: While there are now effective interventions for the symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia, treatment for the functional domains of these illnesses has received less attention. A key area affected by psychotic illness is vocational functioning. This area is currently of interest to clinicians, policy-makers, politicians and patients. This paper reviews several forms of vocational intervention practised over the years and highlights the issues around adopting an early intervention approach towards vocational rehabilitation. The paper has four aims: first, to consider some of the consequences of unemployment for those with psychotic illnesses; second, to review methods that have been used to address unemployment among the mentally ill; third, to highlight the importance of vocational development at a developmentally appropriate life stage; and finally, to consider the application of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation to those with first-episode psychosis.
   Method: An initial broad literature search was conducted using PsychInfo and Medline databases. Further narrower searches were conducted electronically where indicated. Finally, some articles were sourced through manual searches of relevant journals.
   Results: People with psychotic illness have a high rate of unemployment at the outset of their illness which tends to worsen over time. This is complicated by systemic factors such as the structure of the welfare system. Approaches for assisting people with mental illness return to work have evolved over the history of psychiatry. There now exists an evidence-based method of intervention. To date this has not been trialled in a systematic way with people in the early stages of psychotic illness.
   Conclusions: There is cause for cautious optimism in the vocational recovery of people with psychotic illnesses. Limited evidence exists that the individual placement and support approach developed with chronic populations is very effective in early episode patients. There are a number of challenges to implementing vocational intervention in first-episode psychosis. Overcoming these obstacles will require the cooperation of clinicians, those with illness, policy-makers and politicians. However, the potential economic, health and personal gains, as well as current and future research should provide sufficient motivation to overcome these barriers.

AB  - In this article, I argue that research on social stratification, on intergenerational transmission of inequalities, and on the theory of factor payments and wage determination will be strengthened by studying the role played by early childhood health. I show that the inclusion of such a factor requires researchers to integrate theories in each of these fields with new theories linking early childhood health conditions and events that occur at later stages in the life course of individuals, particularly physical and mental health as well as disability and mortality. The empirical evidence I gather shows that early childhood health matters for the achievement of or social accession to, adult social class positions. Even if the magnitude of associations is not overwhelming, it is not weaker than that found between adult social accession and other more conventional and better-studied individual characteristics, such as educational attainment. It is very likely that the evidence presented in this article grossly underplays the importance of early childhood health for adult socioeconomic achievement.

   Method: The academic literature was searched, via PsycINFO and MEDLINE, to identify peer-reviewed studies addressing whether public espousal of a biogenetic paradigm has increased over time, and whether biogenetic causal beliefs and diagnostic labelling are associated with less negative attitudes.
   Results: The public, internationally, continues to prefer psychosocial to biogenetic explanations and treatments for schizophrenia. Biogenetic causal theories and diagnostic labelling as 'illness', are both positively related to perceptions of dangerousness and unpredictability, and to fear and desire for social distance.
   Conclusion: An evidence-based approach to reducing discrimination would seek a range of alternatives to the 'mental illness is an illness like any other' approach, based on enhanced understanding, from multi-disciplinary research, of the causes of prejudice.

AB  - Objectives: To review the recent literature on the relation between depression and coronary heart disease (CHD), including both etiologic studies (that is, depression preceding development of CHD) and prognostic studies (that is, depression predicting prognosis in established CHD), and to assess the degree to which the literature supports a causal interpretation of the link between depression and CHD.
   Method: We searched the MEDLINE, Current Contents, and PsycINFO databases for articles published between December 15, 2003, and December 15, 2005, containing combinations of several key words related to CHD, prognosis, and depression. We reviewed papers for evidence of 6 rule-of-thumb criteria for making causal inferences: objective CHD outcome measures, prospective designs, results showing consistent and strong dose-response relations, adequate covariate adjustment, biological plausibility, and evidence from clinical trials that changing depression alters CHD risk.
   Results: We found 8 recent etiologic studies, 16 prognostic studies, 2 publications with both types of data, and 23 review papers. Although there was much methodological variability concerning measurement of depression and assessment of cardiac outcomes, the recent etiologic studies increase the evidence of a role for depression. Recent prognostic data are less consistent. Small studies showing no link between depression and CHD prognosis continue to appear, despite lack of adequate statistical power.
   Conclusions: The recent literature continues to support both an etiologic and a prognostic role for depression in CHD. Despite this evidence, there have been few clinical trials of depression treatment in CHD patients and no clinical trials of depression prevention. Additional trials are needed.

   Method: Studies assessing observer-rated clinical change and self-rated outcomes were identified. Relevant databases were searched and authors were contacted. Studies were classified according to quality criteria.
   Results: Eighteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most involuntarily admitted patients show substantial clinical improvement over time. Retrospectively, between 33% and 81% of patients regard the admission as justified and/or the treatment as beneficial. Data on predictors of outcomes is limited and inconsistent. Patients with more marked clinical improvement tend to have more positive retrospective judgements.
   Conclusion: A substantial number of involuntary patients do retrospectively not feel that their admission was justified and beneficial. At least for this group, new approaches might have to be considered. Larger studies are required to identify predictors on which patients are likely to fall into this group.

   Aim To systematically review the evidence for dose escalation of SSRIs.
   Method A systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo was performed. Randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses investigating dose escalation of SSRIs were identified. Relevant articles were retrieved and critically appraised. Results were summarised in an evidence table. Pooling was not justified because of heterogeneity of the identified studies.
   Results Eight true dose-escalation studies and three meta-analyses were identified. The available data provided no unequivocal base for dose escalation, Dose escalation before 4 weeks of treatment at a standard dose appeared to be ineffective.
   Conclusions Dose escalation of SSRIs is equivocally supported by evidence of randomised controlled trials; methodological difficulties in the studies may account for this lack of evidence.
   Declaration of interest None.

AB  - Objective: Both behavioural and physiological factors have been proposed as mechanisms that may explain the negative effect of depression on coronary heart disease (CHD). Our aim is to review some of the most important findings since our prior review.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other sources for recent studies of candidate mechanisms, with an emphasis on publications since 2002.
   Results: Physiological pathways have received far greater attention than behavioural ones in the emerging literature. Recent studies have identified shared genetic determinants, inflammation blood clotting, and vascular mechanisms as plausible explanatory mechanisms.
   Conclusions: Future research should focus on relations between behavioural and physiological mechanisms and on the effects of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments for depression on candidate mechanisms.

AB  - Neuroethics, a recently modernized field at the intersection of bioethics and neuroscience, is founded on centuries of discussion of the ethical issues associated with mind and behavior. Broadly defined, neuroethics is concerned with ethical, legal and social policy implications of neuroscience, and with aspects of neuroscience research itself. Advances in neuroscience increasingly challenge long-held views of the self and the individual's relationship to society. Neuroscience also has led to innovations in clinical medicine that have not only therapeutic but also non-therapeutic dimensions that extend well beyond previously charted boundaries. The exponential increase in cross-disciplinary research, the commercialization of cognitive neuroscience, the impetus for training in ethics, and the increased attention being paid to public understanding of science all illuminate the important role of neuroethics in neuroscience.

AB  - The northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis is a ubiquitous seabird found across the North Atlantic Ocean and into the Canadian Arctic. However, we know little of its ecology in the Arctic, which is unfortunate, because it possesses many traits that make it an excellent biomonitor of the condition of Arctic marine environments. Presently, Arctic fulmars face threats from harvest, bycatch in fisheries, and fouling in oil spills while the birds are in their winter range (the North Atlantic). However, during breeding, migration, and overwintering, they may also experience stress from ecotourism, contaminants, particulate garbage, and climate change. In this paper I review the effects of all of these threats on fulmars; and I describe how the ecology of these birds makes them particularly suitable for tracking contaminants, garbage, and the effects of climate change in the Arctic marine ecosystem. I also highlight our key existing knowledge gaps on this species and how additional research will strengthen the utility of fulmars as biomonitors.

AB  - A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is determining how mental representations map onto patterns of neural activity. Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.

AB  - Three enzyme systems, cyclooxygenases that generate prostaglandins, lipoxygenases that form hydroxy derivatives and leukotrienes, and epoxygenases that give rise to epoxyeicosatrienoic products, metabolize arachidonic acid after its release from neural membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A(2). Lysophospholipids, the other products of phospholipase A(2) reactions, are either reacylated or metabolized to platelet-activating factor. Under normal conditions, these metabolites play important roles in synaptic function, cerebral blood flow regulation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and gene expression. Increased activities of cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases under pathological situations such as ischemia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease produce neuroinflammation involving vasodilation and vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, leukocyte chemotaxis and release of cytokines, and oxidative stress. These are closely associated with the neural cell injury which occurs in these neurological conditions. The metabolic products of docosahexaenoic acid, through these enzymes, generate a new class of lipid mediators, namely docosatrienes and resolvins. These metabolites antagonize the effect of metabolites derived from arachidonic acid. Recent studies provide insight into how these arachidonic acid metabolites interact with each other and other bioactive mediators such as platelet-activating factor, endocannabinoids, and docosatrienes under normal and pathological conditions. Here, we review present knowledge of the functions of cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases in brain and their association with neurodegenerative diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective. To characterize physical activity levels of adults with mental retardation and identify limitations in published research.
   Data Sources. Key word searches for "mental retardation," "intellectual disability, " "learning disability," or "developmental disability" combined with "Physical activity" or "habitual exercise" identified articles from MEDLINE, Academic Search Elite, Psych Articles, Health Source, and SPORT Discus. This produced a total of 801 citations.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Published English-language literature that quantitatively measured physical activity levels of adults with mental retardation was included in this review. Fourteen articles met this criterion.
   Data Extraction. Characteristics of participants, study design, outcome measures, methods of analyses, and findings in terms of percentages, step counts, and accelerometer output were extracted.
   Data Synthesis. Data were synthesized to identify the percentage of adults with mental retardation who met published health-related physical activity criteria and compare them with adults without mental retardation and to examine study limitations.
   Results. The studies with the greatest rigor indicate that one-third of adults or fewer with mental retardation were sufficiently active to achieve health benefits. However, data are insufficient to determine whether adults with mental retardation are less active than the general community.
   Conclusions. Future research would be enhanced by including appropriately powered representative samples, by including comparison groups, by validating physical activity questionnaires, and by determining the accuracy of proxy respondents.

AB  - It is well known that a multitude of transmitters and receptors are involved in the nociceptive system, some of them increasing and others inhibiting the pain sensation both peripherally and centrally. These substances, which include neurotransmitters, hormones, etc., can modify of nerves involved in the pain pathways. Furthermore, the organism itself can express very effective antinociception under different circumstances (e.g. stress), and, during such situations, the levels of various endogenous ligands change. A very exciting field of pain research relates to the roles of endogenous ligands. Most of them have been suggested to influence pain transmission, but only a few studies have been performed on the interactions of different endogenous ligands. This review focuses on the results of antinociceptive interactions after the co-administration of endogenous ligands. The data based on 55 situations reveal that the interactions between the endogenous ligands are very different, depending on the substances, the pain tests, the species of animals and the route of administrations. It is also revealed that only a few of the possible interactions between endogenous ligands have been investigated to date, in spite of the fact that the type of antinociceptive interaction between different endogenous ligands could hardly be predicted. The results indicate that the combination of endogenous ligands should not be omitted from the pain therapy arsenal. Attention will hopefully be drawn to the complex interdependence of endogenous ligands and their potential use in clinical practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - in behavioral neurosciences, such as neurobiology and biopsychology, animal models make it possible to investigate brain-behavior relations, with the aim of gaining insight into normal and abnormal human behavior and its underlying neuronal and neuroendocrinological processes.
   Different types of animal models of behavioral dysfunctions are reviewed in this article. In order to determine the precise criteria that an animal model should fulfill, experts from different fields must define the desired characteristics of that model at the neuropathologic and behavioral level. The list of characteristics depends on the purpose of the model. The phenotype-abnormal behavior or behavioral dysfunctions-has to be translated into testable measures in animal experiments. It is essential to standardize rearing, housing, and testing conditions, and to evaluate the reliability, validity (primarily predictive and construct validity), and biological or clinical relevance of putative animal models of human behavioral dysfunctions. This evaluation, guided by a systematic strategy, is central to the development of a model. The necessity of animal models and the responsible use of animals in research are discussed briefly.

AB  - The trace amines are a structurally related group of amines and their isomers synthesized in mammalian brain and peripheral nervous tissues. They are closely associated metabolically with the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmitter systems in mammalian brain. Like dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin the trace amines have been implicated in a vast array of human disorders of affect and cognition. The trace amines are unique as they are present in trace concentrations, exhibit high rates of metabolism and are distributed heterogeneously in mammalian brain. While some are synthesized in their parent amine neurotransmitter systems, there is also evidence to suggest other trace amines may comprise their own independent neurotransmitter systems. A substantial body of evidence suggests that the trace amines may play very significant roles in the coordination of biogenic amine-based synaptic physiology. At high concentrations, they have well-characterized presynaptic "amphetamine-like" effects on catecholamine and indolamine release, reuptake and biosynthesis; at lower concentrations, they possess postsynaptic modulatory effects that potentiate the activity of other neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and serotonin. The trace amines also possess electrophysiological effects that are in opposition to these neurotransmitters, indicating to some researchers the existence of receptors specific for the trace amines. While binding sites or receptors for a few of the trace amines have been advanced, the absence of cloned receptor protein has impeded significant development of their detailed mechanistic roles in the coordination of catecholamine and indolamine synaptic physiology. The recent discovery and characterization of a family of mammalian G protein-coupled receptors responsive to trace amines such as beta-phenylethylamine, tyramine, and octopamine, including socially ingested psychotropic drugs such as amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymetham-phetamine, NN-dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide, have revitalized the field of scientific studies investigating trace amine synaptic physiology, and its association with major human disorders of affect and cognition.

AB  - Increases in attentional effort are defined as the motivated activation of attentional systems in response to detrimental challenges on attentional performance, such as the presentation of distractors, prolonged time-on-task, changing target stimulus characteristics and stimulus presentation parameters, circadian phase shifts, stress or sickness. Increases in attentional effort are motivated by the expected performance outcome; in the absence of such motivation, attentional performance continues to decline or may cease altogether. The beneficial effects of increased attentional effort are due in part to the activation of top-down mechanisms that act to optimize input detection and processing, thereby stabilizing or recovering attentional performance in response to challenges. Following a description of the psychological construct "attentional effort", evidence is reviewed indicating that increases in the activity of cortical cholinergic inputs represent a major component of the neuronal circuitry mediating increases in attentional effort. A neuronal model describes how error detection and reward loss, indicating declining performance, are integrated with motivational mechanisms on the basis of neuronal circuits between prefrontal/anterior cingulate and mesolimbic regions. The cortical cholinergic input system is activated by projections of mesolimbic structures to the basal forebrain cholinergic system. In prefrontal regions, increases in cholinergic activity are hypothesized to contribute to the activation of the anterior attention system and associated executive functions, particularly the top-down optimization of input processing in sensory regions. Moreover, and influenced in part by prefrontal projections to the basal forebrain, increases in cholinergic activity in sensory and other posterior cortical regions contribute directly to the modification of receptive field properties or the suppression of contextual information and, therefore, to the mediation of top-down effects. The definition of attentional effort as a cognitive incentive, and the description of a neuronal circuitry model that integrates brain systems involved in performance monitoring, the processing of incentives, activation of attention systems and modulation of input functions, suggest that 'attentional effort' represents a viable construct for cognitive neuroscience research.

AB  - Numerous degenerative diseases are characterized by the aberrant polymerization and accumulation of specific proteins. These proteopathies include neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and the prion diseases, in addition to diverse systemic disorders, particularly the amyloidoses. The prion diseases have been shown to be transmissible by an alternative conformation of the normal cellular prion protein. Other proteopathies have been thought to be non-transmissible, but there is growing evidence that some systemic and cerebral amyloidoses can be induced by exposure of susceptible hosts to cognate molecular templates. As we review here, the mechanistic similarities among these diseases provide unprecedented opportunities for elucidating the induction of protein misfolding and assembly in vivo, and for developing an integrated therapeutic approach to degenerative proteopathies.

AB  - Exposure to novelty has been shown to induce anxiety responses in a variety of behavioural paradigms. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether exposition of naive rats to novelty would result in a comparable or a different pattern of responses in an open space versus enclosed space with or without the presence of an object in the centre of the field. Lewis and Wistar rats of both genders were used to illustrate and discuss the value and validity of these anxiety paradigms. We examined a wide range of measures, which cover several aspects of animals' responses.
   The results of this study revealed significant differences between the behaviour of animals in an open space and in the enclosed space. It also revealed significant differences in animal's responses to the presence and absence of an object in the open space and in the enclosed space. In the enclosed space, rats spent most of their time in the outer area with lower number of exits and avoided the object area except when there was an object, while in the open space rats displayed frequent short duration re-entries in the outer area and spent longer time in the object area in presence of an object. The time spent in the inner area (away from the outer area and the object area) was significantly longer and the number of faecal boli was significantly higher in the open space than in the enclosed space.
   In the present report, we will discuss the fundamental differences between enclosed space and open space models, and we will examine some methodological issues related to the current animal models of human behaviour in anxiety. In the enclosed,space, animals can avoid the potential threat associated with the centre area of a box and chose the safety of walls and corners, whereas, in the open space animals have to avoid every parts of the field from which there was no safe escape. The response of animals to novelty in an open space model appears more relevant to anxiety than in an enclosed space. The present studies revealed no correlations between the measures of behaviour in enclosed space and the measures of behaviour in open space, which suggest that these two models do not involve the same construct. Our results suggest that the enclosed space model involves avoidance responses while the open space model involves anxiety responses. The open space model can be very useful in understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of anxiety responses, and in assessing the effects of potential anxiolytic drugs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research aimed at elucidating the underlying neurobiology and genetics of bipolar disorder and factors associated with treatment response,. have been limited by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype and lack of knowledge about its underlying diathesis. We used a survey of clinical.. epidemiological, neurobiological, and genetic studies to select and evaluate candidate endophenotypes for bipolar disorder. Numerous findings regarding brain function, brain structure, and response to pharmacological challenge in bipolar patients and their relatives deserve further investigation. Candidate brain function endophenotypes include attention deficits, deficits in verbal learning and memory, cognitive deficits after tryptophan depletion. circadian rhythm instability, and dysmodulation of motivation and reward. We selected reduced anterior cingulate volume and early-onset white matter abnormalities as candidate brain structure endophenotypes. Symptom provocation endophenotypes might be based on bipolar patients' sensitivity to sleep deprivation. psychostimulants, and cholinergic drugs. Phenotypic heterogeneity is a major impediment to the elucidation of the neurobiology and genetics of bipolar disorder. We present a strategy constructed to improve the phenotypic definition of bipolar disorder by elucidating candidate endophenotypes. Studies to evaluate candidate endophenotypes with respect to specificity, heritability temporal stability, and prevalence in unaffected relatives are encouraged.

AB  - Background: Cigarette smoking and lifestyle factors underlying overweight/obesity (such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) appear to play a major role in the excess medical morbidity and mortality among persons with serious mental illnesses. The literature on the prevalence, etiology, prevention, and treatment of these two risk factors, in the context of serious mental illnesses, are reviewed following a preventive approach. Methods: The review relied upon searches of the MEDLINE database, from 1996 through April 2006, restricted to the English language. Original research, review articles, and clinical guidelines relevant to the topics of cigarette smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity among individuals with serious mental illnesses were identified. Results: Compared to those without a mental illness, individuals with a current mental illness are more than twice as likely to smoke cigarettes and more than 50% more likely to be overweight/obese, presumably the product of unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Various biological, iatrogenic, and social factors place psychiatric patients at risk for these and other adverse health behaviors. Studies suggest that many of the same preventive approaches developed for general medical populations are likely to be effective in persons with serious mental disorders, though specialized approaches also are needed. Domains of prevention include primary prevention (population-based strategies to reduce the incidence of these adverse health behaviors), secondary prevention (early detection and treatment), and tertiary prevention (pharmacological and psychosocial treatments to reduce the burden of illness among those with the behaviors in question). However, mental health clinicians commonly lack the training or expertise to provide these services. Conclusions: The high prevalence, adverse effects, and efficaciousness of treatments for smoking and obesity in persons with serious mental illnesses suggest the importance of addressing these problems in this population. Both further research and dissemination efforts are needed to ensure that patients with serious mental illnesses receive the appropriate preventive and clinical services for these two adverse health conditions.

AB  - The clinical signs grouped under the concept of apathy are a common feature of prefrontal and basal ganglia lesions or dysfunctions and can therefore help to improve our understanding of the functional anatomy of the prefrontal-basal ganglia system. Apathy is here defined as a quantitative reduction of voluntary, goal-directed behaviors. The underlying mechanisms responsible for apathy can be divided into three subtypes of disrupted processing: 'emotional-affective', 'cognitive' and 'auto-activation'. Apathy due to the disruption of 'emotional-affective' processing refers to the inability to establish the necessary linkage between emotional-affective signals and the ongoing or forthcoming behavior. It may be related to lesions of the orbital-medial prefrontal cortex or to the related subregions (limbic territory) within the basal ganglia (e.g. ventral striatum, ventral pallidum). Apathy due to the disruption of 'cognitive' processing refers to difficulties in elaborating the plan of actions necessary for the ongoing or forthcoming behavior. It may be related to lesions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the related subregions (associative territory) within the basal ganglia (e.g. dorsal caudate nucleus). The disruption of 'auto-activation' processing refers to the inability to self-activate thoughts or self-initiate actions contrasting with a relatively spared ability to generate externally driven behavior. It is responsible for the most severe form of apathy and in most cases the lesions affect bilaterally the associative and limbic territories of the internal portion of the globus pallidus. It characterizes the syndrome of auto-activation deficit' (also known as 'psychic akinesia' or athymormia'). This syndrome implies that direct lesions of the basal ganglia output result in a loss of amplification of the relevant signal, consequently leading to a diminished extraction of this signal within the frontal cortex. Likewise, apathy occurring in Parkinson's disease could be interpreted as secondary to the loss of spatial and temporal focalization of the signals transferred to the frontal cortex. In both situations (direct basal ganglia lesions and nigro-striatal dopaminergic loss), the capacity of the frontal cortex to select, initiate, maintain and shift programs of actions is impaired.

AB  - Objective: To review the data on the efficacy of oxcarbazepine (OXC) in bipolar disorder (BD) and to provide recommendations for clinicians on the use of this medication in treating BD.
   Method: Using the terms oxcarbazepine and bipolar disorder, oxcarbazepine and mania, or oxcarbazepine and bipolar depression, we conducted a computer-aided search of MEDLINE for the years 1950 to 2005.
   Results: Case reports, retrospective chart reviews, open prospective studies, and double-blind studies reported the efficacy and effectiveness of OXC in treating B. The data indicate that OXC has efficacy in treating acute mania and may be a useful add-on in treating acute bipolar depression and in BD prophylaxis. OXC is generally well-tolerated.
   Conclusion: We recommend using OXC as monotherapy or as add-on therapy in refractory mania, but we recommend it be used predominantly as an add-on treatment for other phases of BD in patients who have not improved with well-established treatments or in patients who have difficulty tolerating adequate dosages.

AB  - Background Research has suggested an association between obstetric complications and bipolar disorder, However, no quantitative evaluation has been made of the pooled data from existing studies.
   Aims To systematically review studies comparing exposure to obstetric complications in cases of bipolar disorder v. non-psychiatric controls, and in cases of bipolar disorder v. cases of other mental disorders.
   Method Publications were identified by computer searches of seven databases, by hand searches of reference lists and from raw data received from researchers.
   Results Forty-six studies were identified, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio for exposure to obstetric complications and subsequent development of bipolar disorder was 1.01 (95% Cl 0.76-1.35) compared with healthy controls, 1.13 (95% CI 0.64-1.99) compared with cases of unipolar disorder and 0.61 (95% CI 0.39-0.95) compared with those who developed schizophrenia.
   Conclusions There is no robust evidence that exposure to obstetric complications increases the risk of developing bipolar disorder. However, the range of events regarded as obstetric complications and methodological inadequacies make definitive conclusions difficult.
   Declaration of interest None.

AB  - Siblings and offspring of persons with schizophrenia carry elevated genetic risk for the illness and manifest attentional and memory impairments. Because less is known about other neuropsychological functions and their specificity in adolescents, we conducted a genetic high-risk (HR) study of schizophrenia (HR-SCZ) and affective psychosis (HR-AFF). Participants (ages 12-25) were from the Harvard Adolescent High-Risk and Hillside Family studies, including 73 HR-SCZ, 18 HR-AFF, and 84 community controls (CCs) recruited in metropolitan Boston and New York. Groups were compared on overall neurocognitive functioning, 6 domains, and 13 test scores, controlling for age, parental education, and correlated data within families. The HR-SCZ group was significantly impaired overall, while the HR-AFF group demonstrated a trend toward overall impairment. HR-SCZ subjects showed significantly lower Verbal Ability (d = .73) and Executive Functioning/Working Memory (d = .47) than CCs. HR-AFF subjects showed reduced Verbal Ability (d = .64) compared to CCs. Excluding 12 CCs with a parental history of depression (without psychosis) led to larger differences between HR and CC groups across domains. Moreover, HR-SCZ and CC group differences in Verbal Memory (d = .39) and Visual-Spatial (d = .34) became statistically significant. There were no significant differences between HR-SCZ and HR-AFF groups. Data support a modest neuropsychological deficit in persons at genetic HR for psychosis, with a broader range of deficits in HR-SCZ. Future work should assess the relationship of neurocognition to adaptive functioning and possible onset of psychosis in HR samples. Ascertainment criteria for controls may markedly influence results and interpretation of group differences.

AB  - This study examined the social effects of emotions related to supplication and appeasement in conflict and negotiation. In a computer-simulated negotiation, participants in Experiment I were confronted with a disappointed or worried opponent (supplication), with a guilty or regretful opponent (appeasement), or with a nonemotional opponent (control). Compared with controls, participants conceded more when the other experienced supplication emotions and conceded less when the other experienced appeasement emotions (especially guilt). Experiment 2 replicated the effects of disappointment and guilt and showed that they are moderated by the perceiver's dispositional trust: Negotiators high in trust conceded more to a disappointed counterpart than to a happy one, but those with low trust were unaffected. In Experiment 3, trust was manipulated through information about the other's personality (cooperative vs. competitive), and a similar moderation was obtained.

AB  - Although we are far from a universally accepted pattern of impaired function at altitude, there is evidence indicating motor, perceptual, memory and behavioural deficits in adults. Even relatively low altitudes (2500 m) may delay reaction time, and impair motor function. Extreme altitude exposure (> 5000 m) may result in more pronounced impairment that can persist after returning to the lowlands. Research into the effects of altitude exposure earlier in development is lacking by comparison. Un-acclimatized children can suffer from acute mountain sickness, and, in native populations born at altitude, subtle cognitive and behavioural deficits suggest incomplete adaptation to hypoxia. The study of neurobehavioural functioning at altitude may provide important information about the effects of clinical hypoxia on the human brain and behavioural development.

Within the span of about 20 years, the prognosis for individuals with OCD has changed from poor to very good as a result of the development of ERP. This success not withstanding, the procedures are far from perfect because a substantial minority of patients still either refuse treatment, drop out prematurely, or fail to benefit. I begin this article with a review of the development of ERP from early animal research on avoidance learning conducted during the 1950s. Next, 1 discuss the mechanisms of ERR The bulk of the article reviews the treatment-outcome literature on ERP for OCD and includes comparisons with cognitive therapy-the '' new kid on the block '' with respect to psychological treatments for OCD.

A literature search was done using Internet search engines and psychological databases to collect English-language journal articles from 1994 onwards. Research indicates that COS is a stable diagnosis. Generally, there is a clear history of premorbid abnormalities, an insidious onset and a deteriorating course. For the majority of cases there seems to be a poor outcome. Despite the limitations in the research conducted thus far, findings provide important insights into COS and several possibilities for future research.

AB  - This paper is riot a comprehensive review of the literature. Rather, it is a viewpoint based upon advances in other fields of medicine and genetics that may provide a model for guiding research in psychiatry. The paper discusses the major limitations of the medicines currently used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The limitations in our understanding of the molecular causes of these two illnesses and our lack of a clear mechanism of action for many of the medicines used to treat them continue to confound the field and impede progress towards finding novel treatments. Until the genetic bases of bipolar illness and schizophrenia are unambiguously identified. progress towards improved diagnosis and treatment will be retarded. An approach to identifying risk genes based upon association studies starting with very large sample sizes based upon currently available diagnoses of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is advocated.

AB  - Delirium, depression and other psychiatric difficulties are commonly encountered by posttransplantation patients, and antipsychotic medicines are frequently used to treat these difficulties. This article reviews previous research data concerning the immunological effects of these medicines, with particular focus on the consequences of prolactin elevation. Unproven but of concern is that these effects may influence graft fate. Older antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine have a high likelihood of elevating prolactin. Prolactin is an immunologically active molecule generally promoting bone marrow function. This may be of benefit post-stem-cell transplant, helping engraftment, but could further rejection of solid-organ transplants. Elevated prolactin is implicated in the facilitation of graft-versus-host disease. Aripiprazole is the antipsychotic medicine least likely to increase prolactin (and may actually decrease prolactin); risperidone, the most likely to increase prolactin. Olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprazadone are antipsychotic medicines with a lower likelihood of elevating prolactin. Older ("neuroleptic'') antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine, droperidol and haloperidol, perphenazine and many others, are likely to elevate serum prolactin. Among antidepressants, most serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with the exception of sertraline, can slightly elevate prolactin. The atypical (i.e., alone in their class) antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine are prolactin neutral. The immunological consequences of psychiatric medicines should be considered when treating transplant patients for delirium, depression and thought disorders; in addition, if elevation of prolactin is thought to be of immunological importance during psychiatric treatment, then it should be monitored and treated. The dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease - bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinerole - usually reverse antipsychotic-induced prolactin increases without compromising psychiatric effectiveness.

AB  - We explore the capacity for music in terms of five questions: (1) What cognitive structures are invoked by music? (2) What are the principles that create these structures? (3) How do listeners acquire these principles? (4) What pre-existing resources make such acquisition possible? (5) Which aspects of these resources are specific to music, and which are more general?
   We examine these issues by looking at the major components of musical organization: rhythm (an interaction of grouping and meter), tonal organization (the structure of melody and harmony), and affect (the interaction of music with emotion). Each domain reveals a combination of cognitively general phenomena, such as gestalt grouping principles, harmonic roughness, and stream segregation, with phenomena that appear special to music and language, such as metrical organization. These are subtly interwoven with a residue of components that are devoted specifically to music, such as the structure of tonal systems and the contours of melodic tension and relaxation that depend on tonality. In the domain of affect, these components are especially tangled, involving the interaction of such varied factors as general-purpose aesthetic framing, communication of affect by tone of voice, and the musically specific way that tonal pitch contours evoke patterns of posture and gesture.

AB  - This review discusses actual and potential contributors to functional improvement after stroke injuries. Topics that will be covered are neuronal re-organization and sprouting, neural stem/progenitor cell,activation and neuronal replacement, as well as the neuronal milieu defined by glia, inflammatory cells and blood vessel supply. It is well established that different types of neuronal plasticity ultimately lead to post-stroke recovery. However, an untapped potential which only recently has started to be extensively explored is neuronal replacement through endogenous or exogenous resources. Major experimental efforts are needed to achieve progress in this burgeoning area. The review stresses the importance of applying neurodevelopmental principles as well as performing a characterization of the role of the postischemic milieu when studying adult brain neural stem/progenitor cells. Integrated and multifaceted experimentation, incorporating actual and possible poststroke function modulators, will be necessary in order to determine future strategies that will ultimately enable considerable progress in the field of neurorehabilitation.

AB  - The discovery of candidate susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and the generation of mice lacking proteins that reproduce biochemical processes that are disrupted in this mental illness offer unprecedented opportunities for improved modelling of this complex disorder. Several lines of evidence indicate that obstetrical complications, as well as fetal or neonatal exposure to viral infection, are predisposing events for some forms of schizophrenia. These environmental events can be modelled in animals, resulting in some of the characteristic features of schizophrenia; however, animal models have yet to be developed that encompass both environmental and genetic aspects of this mental illness. A large number of candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes have been identified that encode proteins implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, neuronal migration, cell adherence, signal transduction, energy metabolism and neurite outgrowth. In support of the importance of these processes in schizophrenia, mice that have reduced levels or completely lack proteins that control glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal migration, cell adherence, signal transduction, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity display many features reminiscent of schizophrenia. In the present review, we discuss strategies for modelling schizophrenia that involve treating mice that bear these mutations in a variety of ways to better model both environmental and genetic factors responsible for this complex mental illness according to a "two-hit hypothesis." Because rodents are able to perform complex cognitive tasks using odour but not visual or auditory cues, we hypothesize that olfactory-based tests of cognitive performance should be used to search for novel therapeutics that ameliorate the cognitive deficits that are a feature of this devastating mental disorder.

AB  - Objective: A number of studies have documented that acculturation to western society is related to an increase in blood pressure (BP). Although there is evidence that higher socioeconomic status appears related to better cardiovascular health, increasing acculturation to western society appears related to worse cardiovascular health. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between acculturation and BP. Methods: Literature searches yielded 125 relevant research manuscripts, which were coded by teams of two independent raters. This study was conducted in 2003 and 2004, and research databases such as MEDLINE and PsychINFO were searched through 2004. Measures of association (effect sizes) were extracted for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings. Random effects models were used to analyze the resulting data. Results: The overall effect sizes associated with acculturation were 0.28 for SBP and 0.30 for DBP, with increasing acculturation to western society related to higher BP. More acculturated individuals bad an average of 4 mm Hg higher BP than less acculturated individuals, which is similar to the effect sizes of known risk factors for high BP such as diet and physical activity. The effects of acculturation on BP appear to be universal, with similar effect sizes found across all regions of the world. Change in BP due to acculturation was not related to body mass index (BMI) or cholesterol but was related to length of residence in the new culture, with the largest effect sizes seen on initial entry and then decreasing rapidly within the first few years. Sudden cultural changes, such as migration from rural to urban settings, resulted in the largest effect sizes, which finding supports the hypothesis that the stress of cultural change is important role in the acculturation effect. Conclusions: Acculturation to western society is associated with higher BP, and the distress associated with cultural change appears to be more influential than changes in diet or physical activity. Future studies would benefit from investigating how cultural change affects health and examining whether some nonwestern cultural values and practices are health protective.

AB  - The present study used the redundant target paradigm on healthy subjects to investigate functional hemispheric asymmetries and interhemispheric cooperation in the perception of emotions from faces. In Experiment 1 participants responded to checkerboards presented either unilaterally to the left (LVF) or right visual half field (RVF), or simultaneously to both hemifields (BVF), while performing a pointing task for the control of eye movements. As previously reported (Miniussi et al. in J Cogn Neurosci 10:216-230, 1998), redundant stimulation led to shorter latencies for stimulus detection (bilateral gain or redundant target effect, RTE) that exceeded the limit for a probabilistic interpretation, thereby validating the pointing procedure and supporting interhemispheric cooperation. In Experiment 2 the same pointing procedure was used in a go/no-go task requiring subjects to respond when seeing a target emotional expression (happy or fearful, counterbalanced between blocks). Faster reaction times to unilateral LVF than RVF emotions, regardless of valence, indicate that the perception of positive and negative emotional faces is lateralized toward the right hemisphere. Simultaneous presentation of two congruent emotional faces, either happy or fearful, produced an RTE that cannot be explained by probability summation and suggests interhemispheric cooperation and neural summation. No such effect was present with BVF incongruent facial expressions. In Experiment 3 we studied whether the RTE for emotional faces depends on the physical identity between BVF stimuli, and we set a second BVF congruent condition in which there was only emotional but not physical or gender identity between stimuli (i.e. two different faces expressing the same emotion). The RTE and interhemispheric cooperation were present also in this second BVF congruent condition. This shows that emotional congruency is the sufficient condition for the RTE to take place in the intact brain and that the cerebral hemispheres can interact in spite of physical differences between stimuli.

AB  - Human susceptibility to obesity is ail unusual phenomenon amongst annuals. An evolutionary analysis, identifying factors favouring the capacity for fat deposition, may aid in the development of preventive public health strategies. This article considers the proximate causes, ontogeny, fitness value and evolutionary history of human fat deposition. Proximate causes include diet composition, physical activity level, feeding behaviour, endocrine and genetic factors, psychological traits, and exposure to broader environmental factors. Fat deposition peaks during late gestation and early infancy, and again during adolescence in females. As in other species, human fat stores not only buffer malnutrition, but also regulate reproduction and immune function, and are subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, our characteristic ontogenetic pattern of fat deposition, along with relatively high fatness in adulthood, contrasts with die phenotype of other mammals occupying the tropical savannah environment in which hominids evolved. The increased Value of energy stores in our species can be attributed to factors increasing either uncertainty in energy availability, or vulnerability to that uncertainty. Early hominid evolution was characterised by adaptation to a more seasonal environment, when selection would have favoured general thriftiness. The evolution of the large expensive brain in the genus Homo then favoured increased energy stores in the reproducing female, and in the offspring in early life. More recently, the introduction of agriculture has had three significant effects: exposure to regular famine; adaptation to a variety of local niches favouring population-specific adaptations; and the development of social hierarchies which predispose to differential exposure to environmental pressures. Thus, humans have persistently encountered greater energy stress than that experienced by their closest living relatives during recent evolution. The capacity to accumulate fat has therefore been a major adaptive feature of our species, but is now increasingly maladaptive in the modern environment where fluctuations in energy supply have been minimised, and productivity is dependent on mechanisation rather than physical effort. Alterations to the obesogenic environment are predicted to play a key role in reducing the prevalence of obesity.

   Results Ten trials were included in the review.We found no evidence that the combination of an antidepressant with an antipsychotic is more effective than an antidepressant alone. This combination was statistically more effective than an antipsychotic alone.
   Conclusions Antidepressant monotherapy and adding an antipsychotic if the patient does not respond, or starting with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, both appear to be appropriate options for patients with unipolar psychotic depression. However, clinically the balance between risks and benefits may suggest the first option should be preferred for many patients. Starting with an antipsychotic alone appears to be inadequate.

AB  - The authors conducted an extensive search for published works concerning healthcare utilization and mortality among Gulf War veterans of the Coalition forces who served during the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Reports concerning the health experience of US, UK, Canadian, Saudi and Australian veterans were reviewed. This report summarizes 15 years of observations and research in four categories: Gulf War veteran healthcare registry studies, hospitalization studies, outpatient studies and mortality studies. A total of 149 728 (19.8%) of 756 373 US, UK, Canadian and Australian Gulf War veterans received health registry evaluations revealing a vast number of symptoms and clinical conditions but no suggestion that a new unique illness was associated with service during the Gulf War. Additionally, no Gulf War exposure was uniquely implicated as a cause for post-war morbidity. Numerous large, controlled studies of US Gulf War veterans' hospitalizations, often involving more than a million veterans, have been conducted. They revealed an increased post-war risk for mental health diagnoses, multi-symptom conditions and musculoskeletal disorders. Again, these data failed to demonstrate that Gulf War veterans suffered from a unique Gulf War-related illness. The sparsely available ambulatory care reports documented that respiratory and gastrointestinal complaints were quite common during deployment. Using perhaps the most reliable data, controlled mortality studies have revealed that Gulf War veterans were at increased risk of injuries, especially those due to vehicular accidents. In general, healthcare utilization data are now exhausted. These findings have now been incorporated into preventive measures in support of current military forces. With a few diagnostic exceptions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mental disorders and cancer, it now seems time to cease examining Gulf War veteran morbidity and to direct future research efforts to preventing illness among current and future military personnel.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia involve social interaction problems and poor mentalizing abilities, associated with abnormal regional cerebral activity. Similar problems may be present in aggressive personality disorders and psychopathy. This paper reviews brain imaging data from research aiming at establishing possible central nervous correlates to aggression and psychopathy. Studies in this field are associated with a range of method problems. Differences between criminal offenders and controls may be confounded by a number of factors unrelated to personality traits or aggression per se. Phenotypical characterisation varies between Studies as do the laboratory methods and their interpretation. In spite of these problems, there are some recurrent findings in the present literature. Hypoactivity or structural reduction of the prefrontal cortex is a consistent finding in violent offenders or subjects with antisocial personality disorder. When defined as a personality disorder of social interaction and empathy, psychopathy seems to be associated rather with central abnormalities in the limbic circuitry. Indications of ail increased dopaminergic neurotransmission relative to the serotonergic have also been connected to such personality traits, especially to the AD/HD-related behavioural aspects. Further studies using strict phenotypical definitions or experimental models are clearly warranted to establish a pathophysiological background to destructive personality traits and the propensity to violent acting out.

AB  - The Study, and the preceding companion article, reviews the pioneering contributions of Constantin von Economo (1876-193 1) to Neuroscience in a modern context. The neurological Studies of von Economo include the discovery of a new nosological entity, encephalitis lethargica, with which his name is forever linked ('von Economo disease'). Based on a percipient analysis of pathoanatomical material from patients with encephalitis lethargica who manifested with either insomnia or somnolence, von Economo deduced the existence of distinct centres in the brain for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. He presented a synthesis of his ideas in a series of lectures in New York in 1929 and at the First International Neurological Congress held in Berne in 1931. Constantin von Economo was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of encephalitis lethargica. As those studies have exerted and continue to exert the highest impact among von Economo's publications, the present article examines the spectrum of his observations on encephalitis lethargica and the cerebral control of sleep, documented in 63 published works-including post-humous translations into French and English of original German texts; complete bibliographic information is given. His remaining 76 works of an annotated total of 139 scientific publications deal with brain structure. evolution and intelligence, as well as general works on nervous and mental pathology and form the focus of the preceding article.

AB  - The combined efforts of many fields are advancing our understanding of how number is represented. Researchers studying numerical reasoning in adult humans, developing humans and non-human animals are using a suite of behavioral and neurobiological methods to uncover similarities and differences in how each population enumerates and compares quantities to identify the neural substrates of numerical cognition. An important picture emerging from this research is that adult humans share with non-human animals a system for representing number as language-independent mental magnitudes and that this system emerges early in development.

AB  - Schizophrenia is associated with a broad range of neurodevelopmental, structural and behavioral abnormalities that often progress with or without treatment. Evidence indicates that such neurodevelopmental abnormalities may result from defective genes and/or non-genetic factors such as pre-natal and neonatal infections, birth complications, famines, maternal malnutrition, drug and alcohol abuse, season of birth, sex, birth order and life style. Experimentally, these factors have been found to cause the cellular metabolic stress that often results in oxidative stress, such as increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) over the antioxidant capacity. This can trigger the oxidative cell damage ( i.e., DNA breaks, protein inactivation, altered gene expression, loss of membrane lipid-bound essential polyunsaturated fatty acids [ EPUFAs] and often apoptosis) contributing to abnormal neural growth and differentiation. The brain is preferentially susceptible to oxidative damage since it is under very high oxygen tension and highly enriched in ROS susceptible proteins, lipids and poor DNA repair. Evidence is increasing for increased oxidative stress and cell damage in schizophrenia. Furthermore, treatments with some anti-psychotics together with the lifestyle and dietary patterns, that are pro-oxidant, can exacerbate the oxidative cell damage and trigger progression of neuropathology. Therefore, adjunctive use of dietary antioxidants and EPUFAs, which are known to regulate the growth factors and neuroplasticity, can effectively improve the clinical outcome. The dietary supplementation of either antioxidants or EPUFAs, particularly omega-3 has already been found to improve some psychopathologies. However, a combination of antioxidants and omega-3 EPUFAs, particularly in the early stages of illness, when brain has high degree of neuroplasticity, potentially may be even more effective for long-term improved clinical outcome of schizophrenia.

AB  - Scholars from diverse fields have begun to study the intersection of emotion and law. The notion that reason and emotion are cleanly separable-and that law rightly privileges and admits only of the former-is deeply engrained. Law and emotion scholarship proceeds instead from the belief that the legal relevance of emotion is both significant and deserving of (and amenable to) close scrutiny. It is organized around six approaches, each of which is defined and discussed: emotion-centered, emotional phenomenon, emotion theory, legal doctrine, theory of law; and legal actor.
   Drawing on the analytic value of the proposed taxonomy, any exploration of law and emotion should strive to identify which emotion(s) it takes as its focus; distinguish implicated emotion-driven phenomena; explore relevant and competing theories of the emotions; limit itself to a particular type of legal doctrine; expose underlying theories of law; and make clear which legal actors are implicated. Directions for future research are discussed and cross-disciplinary collaboration encouraged.

AB  - Everyone ages, but only some will develop a neurodegenerative disorder in the process. Disease might occur when cells fail to respond adaptively to age-related increases in oxidative, metabolic and ionic stress, thereby resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins, DNA and membranes. Determinants of neuronal vulnerability might include cell size and location, metabolism of disease-specific proteins and a repertoire of signal transduction pathways and stress resistance mechanisms. Emerging evidence on protein interaction networks that monitor and respond to the normal ageing process suggests that successful neural ageing is possible for most people, but also cautions that cures for neurodegenerative disorders are unlikely in the near future.

AB  - The ACh hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a combinatorial series of proteins with variant N and C termini generated from alternate promoter usage and 3' alternative splicing. Neuronal AChE variants show indistinguishable enzymatic activity yet differ in their expression, multimeric assembly and membrane-association patterns. Differentially induced under stress, they show distinct non-hydrolytic properties and interact with different protein partners. Recent findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of AChE pre-mRNA is a neuroprotection strategy but might involve long-term damage. Specifically, variant-specific causal involvement of AChE in the progression of both neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and neuromuscular syndromes (e.g. myasthenia gravis) raises the possibility that future therapeutic drugs might target specific AChE variant(s) or the corresponding RNA transcripts.

AB  - Objective: Antidepressants are commonly used drugs with potential for numerous drug interactions. This study aims to systematically review the literature on drug interactions with antidepressants.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to 2003), using the heading drug interactions combined with individual antidepressant names. We restricted searches to English-language articles and human studies. We screened drug interaction texts and review articles for relevant studies. We included articles reporting original human data on drug interactions with antidepressants commonly used in North America. Articles were independently evaluated by 2 reviewers on clinical effect, clinical significance, and quality of evidence. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
   Results: There were 904 eligible interactions, involving 9509 patients, for a total of 598 summary interactions. Of these, 439 (73%) demonstrated an interaction, 148 (25%) had no effect, and 11 (2%) had conflicting evidence. For 510 interactions (85%), the quality of evidence was poor.. It was fair for 67 (11%) interactions and good for 10 (2%) interactions. There were no interactions with excellent quality of evidence. There were 145 (24%) interactions of major clinical significance. These were predominantly hypertensive emergencies and serotonin syndrome. Most interacting drugs had central nervous system (CNS) activity. As expected, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) appear to be the most problematic family in terms of potential for serious drug interactions.
   Conclusions: Drug interactions with antidepressants are an important cause for concern, but this concern is based primarily on poor evidence. We recommend caution when combining antidepressants with other CNS drugs, particularly when coadministering MAOIs with other substances.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share several pathological mechanisms. The parallels between amyloid beta (A beta) in AD and alpha-synuclein in PD have been discussed in several reports. However, studies of the last few years show that A beta also shares several important characteristics with neuromelanin (NM), whose role in PD is emerging. First, both molecules accumulate with aging, the greatest risk factor for AD and PD. Second, in spite of their different structures, A beta and NM have similar characteristics that could also lead to neuroprotection. Metals are required to catalyze their formation and they can bind large amounts of these metals, generating stable complexes and thus playing a protective role against metal toxicity. Moreover, they may be able to remove toxic species such as oligopeptides and excess cytosolic dopamine. Third, both A beta and NM have been implicated in parallel aspects of the neuronal death that underlies AD and PD, respectively. For example, both molecules can activate microglia, inducing release of toxic factors such as tumor necrosis factor-a JNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO). A careful analysis of these parallel effects of A beta and NM, including their seemingly paradoxical ability to participate in both cell death and protection, may lead to an improved understanding of the roles of these molecules in neurodegeneration and also provide insights into possible parallels in the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and PD.

AB  - Research results that have been reported indicate that the specific outcomes of teamwork vary and are in part context-dependant, while less is known about the interaction between teamwork and psychological factors. This paper reviews research results published in scientific journals in the period 2000-2005, and assesses current knowledge of teams and associated psychological factors. Furthermore, the review process identified the importance of team constituent factors (interdependence and team autonomy), team type and team size, and contextual factors for the results that were reported, and assessed the design and research-methodological foundations of those results. The main inclusion criteria for papers were that they had been based on field studies of formally established teams and were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Furthermore they must have been based on the use of questionnaires, and the occupational sector must have been identified. Fifty-five papers were identified for inclusion in the review. An almost consistent pattern of positive associations between psychological variables and teamwork was found to be reported across team types, team sizes, and contextual factors. Furthermore, the reported psychological factors appear to be positively linked to team autonomy and team interdependence. This paper discusses the strength of the interactions between teamwork and various psychological variables, and suggests directions for future research.

AB  - Nematodes represent a very abundant group of soil organisms and non-parasitic species are important for soil quality and in the soil food web. In recent years, it has been shown that nematodes are appropriate bioindicators of soil condition and they are also suitable organisms for laboratory toxicity testing. The aims of this paper are to overview and critically assess methods and approaches for researching soil nematode ecotoxicology. In natural ecosystems, nematode abundance and community structure analyses were proved to be sensitive indicators of stress caused by soil pollutants and ecological disturbance. Community structure analyses may be approached from a functional or ecological point of view; species are divided into groups according to their feeding habits or alternatively the maturity index is calculated according to their ecological strategy. Many environmental factors have the potential to affect nematode community, which consequently results in high space and time variability. This variance is major handicap in field ecotoxicological studies because pollutant-nematode relationships are obscured. For prospective risk assessment of chemicals, several toxicity tests with nematodes were developed and are increasingly used. Sensitivity of these tests is comparable to tests with other soil species (e.g. enchytraeids, earthworms and springtails) while tests are less demanding to space and time. Most studies have focused on metal toxicity but organic compounds are almost overlooked. Endpoints used in tests were often mortality, reproduction or movement, but more sublethal endpoints such as feeding or biomarkers have been used recently too. Although there is an increasing amount of knowledge in soil nematode ecotoxicology, there is still a lot of various issues in this topic to research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To overview the field of psychotherapy in the medically ill. Rather than attempting a systematic review of this very extensive area, the article seeks to capture some of the main threads and issues of importance.
   Method: The subject is looked at under four headings: (i) which illnesses have attracted research interest in psychotherapy; (ii) which outcome measures have been chosen; (iii) which modes of intervention have been used; and (iv) finally a review of the methodology and the results obtained.
   Results: Some illnesses have attracted much more psychotherapeutic interest than others; the differences are haphazard. Outcome measures on the whole have focused on coping with illness and psychological distress, with a smaller number looking at disease outcome. Only short-term changes have been sought in the main. The most commonly used modalities of therapy have been cognitive-behavioural; additionally, supportive information-giving and group therapy have been trialled. Benefit in terms of all these have been reported, but the majority of studies are weakened by major methodological shortcomings.
   Conclusion: There is an overall paucity of well-designed studies that clearly demonstrate psychotherapy as an efficacious treatment in the medically ill. The field is hampered by the lack of a clear conceptual thread recognizing the long-term and diverse experience of patients with medical illness and relating this to the question of the part psychotherapy should play. Future work needs to concentrate on appropriate selection of patients who might benefit, as well as including a wider range of more clinically relevant outcome measures and more stringent methodology.

AB  - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were among the first antidepressants to be discovered and have long been used as such. It now seems that many of these agents might have therapeutic value in several common neurodegenerative conditions, independently of their inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity. However, many claims and some counterclaims have been made about the physiological importance of these enzymes and the potential of their inhibitors. We evaluate these arguments in the light of what we know, and still have to learn, of the structure, function and genetics of the monoamine oxidases and the disparate actions of their inhibitors.

AB  - Background: Socio-economic variations in health, including variations in health according to wealth and income, have been widely reported. A potential method of improving the health of the most deprived groups is to increase their income. State funded welfare programmes of financial benefits and benefits in kind are common in developed countries. However, there is evidence of widespread under claiming of welfare benefits by those eligible for them. One method of exploring the health effects of income supplementation is, therefore, to measure the health effects of welfare benefit maximisation programmes. We conducted a systematic review of the health, social and financial impacts of welfare rights advice delivered in healthcare settings.
   Methods: Published and unpublished literature was accessed through searches of electronic databases, websites and an internet search engine; hand searches of journals; suggestions from experts; and reference lists of relevant publications. Data on the intervention delivered, evaluation performed, and outcome data on health, social and economic measures were abstracted and assessed by pairs of independent reviewers. Results are reported in narrative form.
   Results: 55 studies were included in the review. Only seven studies included a comparison or control group. There was evidence that welfare rights advice delivered in healthcare settings results in financial benefits. There was little evidence that the advice resulted in measurable health or social benefits. This is primarily due to lack of good quality evidence, rather than evidence of an absence of effect.
   Conclusion: There are good theoretical reasons why income supplementation should improve health, but currently little evidence of adequate robustness and quality to indicate that the impact goes beyond increasing income.

AB  - The quest to disentangle the aetiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been heavily influenced by the genes associated with the disease. The alpha-synuclein-centric theory of protein aggregation with the adjunct of parkin-driven proteasome deregulation has, in recent years, been complemented by the discovery and increasing knowledge of the functions of DJ1, PINK1 and OMI/HTRA2, which are all associated with the mitochondria and have been implicated in cellular protection against oxidative damage. We critically review how these genes fit into and enhance our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, and consider how oxidative stress might be a potential unifying factor in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease.

Research on emotional body language is rapidly emerging as a new field in cognitive and affective neuroscience. This article reviews how whole-body signals are automatically perceived and understood, and their role in emotional communication and decision-making.

   Results: Approximately 12/100000 individuals aged 65 years or over die by suicide in Canada annually. Suicide is most prevalent among older white men; risk is associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour, mental illness, personality vulnerability, medical illness, losses and poor social supports, functional impairment, and low resiliency. Novel measures to assess late-life suicide features are under development. Few randomized treatment trials exist with at-risk older adults.
   Conclusions: Research is needed on risk and resiliency and clinical assessment and interventions for at-risk older adults. Collaborative outreach strategies might aid suicide prevention.

   Method: A wide-ranging literature search reviewed possible factors that may contribute to the geographical variation in suicide. Literature was organized to enable examination of compositional and contextual explanations, as well as collective social functioning and social practices.
   Results: A variety of factors may contribute to elevated rates of suicide in rural compared with urban areas. Collective and contextual (place) factors seem to be of particular importance as possible contributors to the elevated rate of suicide among rural males. These include rural socioeconomic decline; facilitators and barriers to service utilization such as service availability and accessibility, rural culture, community attitudes to mental illness and help seeking; and exposure to firearms.
   Conclusions: Compositional, contextual and collective factors are hypothesized to influence the elevated rate of suicide in rural compared with urban areas. These factors need to be tested in empirical studies that consider both individual and community-based risk factors, and are designed to enable exploration of likely within-rural differences.

AB  - Objective: In subjects with borderline personality disorder (BPD), compared with subjects who attempted suicide, to review neuropsychological (NP) function that may predispose to suicidal behaviour along a continuum of high and low lethality.
   Method: We undertook electronic searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Biosos Reviews, and Cinhal. The searches were restricted to English-language publications from 1985 onward. The search terms borderline personality disorder, suicide, suicide attempt, self-harm behaviour, neuropsychological, executive function (EF), neurocognitive, and neuropsychological function produced 29 neuropsychology studies involving BPD and 7 neuropsychology studies of suicide attempters, regardless of psychiatric diagnosis.
   Results: Of the BPD studies, 83% found NP impairment in one or more cognitive domains, irrespective of depression, involving specific or generalized deficits linked to the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal regions. The functions most frequently reported (in 71% to 86% of BPD studies) are response-inhibitory processes affecting executive function performance that requires speeded attention and visuomotor skills. Decision making and visual memory impairment are also most frequently affected; 60% to 67% of BPD studies report attentional impairment, verbal memory impairment, and visuospatial organizational impairment. Least affected processes in BPD appear to involve spatial working memory, planning, and possibly, IQ. The similarities in NP deficits found in BPD and suicide-attempt studies involve decision making and Trails performances. BPD studies, however, reflect more frequent impairment on the Stroop Test and Wisconsin Card Sort Test performance than the suicide-attempt studies, whereas verbal fluency appears to be more frequently impaired in those attempting suicide.
   Conclusions: Impaired EF and disinhibitory processes, as indicated by verbal fluency, Trails, and Stroop performance, primarily associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions may represent a dominant executive pathway to suicide attempt. A primary motivational inhibitory pathway involving conflictual, affective, and reflexive decision-making processes associated with orbitofrontal brain regions, in combination with significant cognitive rigidity, may influence the repetitive expression of self-harm or low-lethality suicidal behaviour. The hypothesis of a specific trait-like cognitive vulnerability for suicidal behaviour involving dysregulatory, disinhibiting pathways awaits confirmation.

AB  - Though there are effective psychological and drug treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many patients remain inadequately treated or untreated. Making effective self-treatment guidance available may increase the number of patients being helped. In this review. database and manual literature searches were performed of case studies, open and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of bibliotherapy, self-help groups, telecare and computer-aided self-help for OCD. We found no RCTs of bibliotherapy or self-help groups for OCD. Three open studies showed the efficacy of brief exposure and ritual prevention (ERP) instructions delivered by a live therapist by phone. A vicarious ERP computer program was effective in a small open study. Fully interactive computer-aided self-help by ERP for OCD was efficacious in two open studies and a large multicentre RCT, and in a small RCT compliance and outcome with that program was enhanced by brief scheduled support from a clinician. Although more research is needed, self-help approaches have the potential to help many more patients who would otherwise remain inadequately treated or untreated. Their dissemination could save resources used by health care providers. We propose a stepped care model for the treatment of OCD. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review applied meta-analytic procedures to integrate research findings examining the impact of exercise on body image. We performed extensive literature searching strategies and located 121 published and unpublished studies that examined the impact of exercise on body image. Primary study results were coded, and meta-analytic procedures were conducted. Studies were grouped into intervention (i.e., exercise vs nonexercise group post-exercise intervention body-image scores), single group (i.e., pre vs post exercise intervention body-image scores), and correlational (i.e., exercisers vs nonexercisers body-image scores) effect sizes. Small effect sizes (that were weighted by sample size), that were significantly different from zero, indicated that: (a) exercisers had a more positive body image than nonexercisers; (b) exercise intervention participants reported a more positive body image post intervention compared to the nonexercising control participants; and (c) exercisers had a significant improvement in body image scores following an exercise intervention. We concluded that exercise was associated with improved body image. Moderating variables and implications for exercise prescription to improve body image were discussed.

AB  - Objective: In many parts of the world, second-generation antipsychotics have largely replaced typical antipsychotics as the treatment of choice for schizophrenia. Consequently, trials comparing two drugs of this class-so-called head-to-head studies-are gaining in relevance. The authors reviewed results of head-to-head studies of second-generation antipsychotics funded by pharmaceutical companies to determine if a relationship existed between the sponsor of the trial and the drug favored in the study's overall outcome.
   Method: The authors identified head-to-head comparison studies of second-generation antipsychotics through a MEDLINE search for the period from 1966 to September 2003 and identified additional head-to-head studies from selected conference proceedings for the period from 1999 to February 2004. The abstracts of all studies fully or partly funded by pharmaceutical companies were modified to mask the names and doses of the drugs used in the trial, and two physicians blinded to the study sponsor reviewed the abstracts and independently rated which drug was favored by the overall outcome measures. Two authors who were not blinded to the study sponsor reviewed the entire report of each study for sources of bias that could have affected the results in favor of the sponsor's drug.
   Results: Of the 42 reports identified by the authors, 33 were sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. In 90.0% of the studies, the reported overall outcome was in favor of the sponsor's drug. This pattern resulted in contradictory conclusions across studies when the findings of studies of the same drugs but with different sponsors were compared. Potential sources of bias occurred in the areas of doses and dose escalation, study entry criteria and study populations, statistics and methods, and reporting of results and wording of findings.
   Conclusions: Some sources of bias may limit the validity of head-to-head comparison studies of second-generation antipsychotics. Because most of the sources of bias identified in this review were subtle rather than compelling, the clinical usefulness of future trials may benefit from minor modifications to help avoid bias. The authors make a number of concrete suggestions for ways in which potential sources of bias can be addressed by study initiators, peer reviewers of studies under consideration for publication, and readers of published studies.

AB  - Problems associated with the topic of the mind-brain interaction are reviewed and analyzed. If there is an interaction, then the "mind" and "brain" are independent variables; the mind represents subjective experience and is therefore a non-physical phenomenon. This fact led to the need for a field theory, termed here the "cerebral mental field" (CMF). By definition, the CMF is a system property produced by the appropriate activities of billions of neurons. An experimental test of this theory is possible and a test design is presented. The most direct experimental evidence has been obtained by use of intracranial stimulating and recording electrodes. Important information has also been developed, however, with extracranial imaging techniques. These can be very fast (in ms), but the cerebral neuronal events that produce changes in physiological properties require a time delay for their processing. A number of surprising time factors affecting the appearance of a subjective somatosensory experience are described, and their wider implications are discussed. Among these is a delay (up to, 0.5 s) in the generation of a sensory awareness. Thus, unconscious cerebral processes precede a subjective sensory experience. If this can be generalized to all kinds of subjective experiences, it would mean that all mental events begin unconsciously and not just those that never become conscious. In spite of the delay for a sensory experience, subjectively there appears to be no delay. Evidence was developed to demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on an antedating of the delayed experience. There is a subjective referral backward in time to coincide with the time of the primary cortical response to the earliest arriving sensory signal. The subjective referral in time is analogous to the well-known subjective referral in space. In conclusion, features of the CMF can be correlated with brain events, even though the CMF is non-physical, by study of subjective reports from the human subject. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper considers the role of disturbances in affect regulation in the development and course of somatoform disorders. We first give an overview of contemporary theories in the field of psychosomatic medicine that links deficits in emotion regulation to the process of somatization, and then review recent empirical research that focuses on the association between affect regulation and somatoform disorders, with an emphasis on studies investigating the alexithymia construct. Overall, the findings suggest that somatoform disorders are linked to a diminished capacity to consciously experience and differentiate affects and express them in an adequate or healthy way. It must be noted, however, that this result has not been obtained exclusively for somatoform disorders. A promising approach to further our understanding of the developmental roots of impaired affect regulation in somatoform disorders is attachment research. The attachment research reviewed in this paper indicates that a dismissing status of attachment is linked to defensive forms of processing and expressing emotions. We present some new data that not only provide empirical support of a high proportion of dismissing attachment in somatoform disorders but also suggest that the degree to which somatoform disorder patients employ dismissing attachment strategies is strongly related to affect dysregulation. Finally, some implications for psychotherapeutic interventions in patients with somatoform disorders are considered.

   Aims To review the complementary medicines routinely encountered in psychiatric practice, their effectiveness, potential adverse effects and interactions
   Method Electronic and manual literature search on the effectiveness and safety of psychotropic complementary medicines.
   Results Potentially useful substances include ginkgo and hydergine as cognitive enhancers, passion flower and valerian as sedatives, St John's wort and sadenosylmethionine as antidepressants, and selenium and folate to complement antidepressants. The evidence is less conclusive for the use of omega-3 fatty acids as augmentation treatment in schizophrenia, melatonin for tardive dyskinesia and 18-methoxycoronaridine, an ibogaine derivative, for the treatment of cocaine and heroin addiction.
   Conclusions Systematic clinical trials are needed to test promising substances. Meanwhile, those wishing to take psychotropic complementary medicines require appropriate advice.

AB  - Incomplete symptom remission and sexual side effects are common problems for which bupropion often is added to treatment with selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This article reviews the literature on combining bnpropion with SSRIs or SNRIs. We used MEDLINE to select studies that included patients diagnosed with MDD treated with any combination of bupropion and an SSRI or SNRI, either to enhance antidepressant response or to ameliorate antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction. Bibliographies of located articles were searched for additional studies. Controlled and open-label studies support the effectiveness of bupropion in reversing antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction, whereas open trials suggest that combination treatment with bupropion and an SSRI or SNRI is effective for the treatment of MDD in patients refractory to the SSRI, SNRI, or bupropion alone. The available data suggest that, although not an approved indication, the combination of bupropion and either an SSRI or an SNRI is generally well tolerated. can boost antidepressant effects. Additional randomized controlled studies are needed to answer response, and can reduce SSRI or SNRI-associated sexual side important questions, such as those regarding optimal dose and duration of treatment.

AB  - Neuroprotective therapy is a pivotal aim in the treatment of the relentlessly progressive disorder Parkinson's disease. However, more than 60% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra have already degenerated, when the diagnosis may be established. At this "advanced stage" neuroprotective strategies will - if at all - only have limited effect. It is, therefore. essential to establish markers to identify subjects at risk before motor manifestation. A number of such "premotor" signs have been discovered and investigated lately. Such signs include a genetic vulnerability and hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra as well as premotor symptoms like olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, REM sleep behaviour disorder, visual and neuropsychological impairment. Moreover, first signs of affection of the substantia nigra like PET and SPECT abnormalities and slight motor signs can be included, as they may be detected before a definite diagnosis can be made.
   Although most of these sips and symptoms are unspecific if singularly evaluated a combination of these features may indeed be valuable to detect a subgroup of the population at risk for PD. However, future studies are necessary to establish the predictive value of these "markers" singularly and in combination.

AB  - The discovery of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) by Pfurtscheller paved the way for the development of brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs allow control of computers or external devices with the regulation of brain activity only. Two different research traditions produced two different types of BCIs: invasive BCIs, realized with implanted electrodes in brain tissue and noninvasive BCIs using electrophysiological recordings in humans such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and metabolic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Clinical applications were reserved with few exceptions for the noninvasive approach: communication with the completely paralyzed and locked-in syndrome with slow cortical potentials (SCPs), sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), and P300 and restoration of movement and cortical reorganization in high spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived Communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients. Movement restoration was achieved with noninvasive BCIs based on SMRs control in single cases with spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations from spike patterns and extracellular field potentials. Whether invasive approaches allow superior brain control of motor responses compared to noninvasive BCI with intelligent peripheral devices and electrical muscle stimulation and EMG feedback remains to be demonstrated. The newly developed fMRI-BCIs and NIRS-BCIs offer promise for the learned regulation of emotional disorders and also disorders of small children (in the case of NIRS).

TI  - The Prospective Cognition of Food Caching and Recovery by Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica)
AB  - The role of prospective cognition in food caching and recovery by western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) is reviewed. These birds anticipate the short-term consequences of searching for cached food at recovery by reducing their searches for devalued food items. Two further lines of evidence suggest that the jays are also capable of more long-term prospection. First, the caching of food items decreases when they are consistently degraded or pilfered at recovery over cache-recovery intervals that preclude direct delayed reinforcement and punishment. Second, the jays anticipate the pilfering of their caches by another bird, which observes the caching episode, by engaging in various cache-protection behaviors. These finding suggest that the jays are capable of a form of prospective mental "time travel".

AB  - Background: In the European Union, work-related stress affects about one in four workers, and it may be responsible for the loss of productivity, healthcare consumption and absenteeism. The objective of our study was to estimate whether stress programmes aimed at managing and preventing work-related stress reduced the rate of absenteeism.
   Methods: We searched electronic databases for relevant articles assisted by hand searching for references. We included studies that had an experimental or quasi-experimental design, describing an intervention focused either on the work organisation or on workers' characteristics as well as reporting a measure of absenteeism.
   Results: The search identified 2520 articles: among these, nine met our inclusion criteria. Stress management programmes reduced absenteeism shortly after the intervention however in the long term there was no evidence to support this.
   Conclusion: Future studies should evaluate stress management programmes that consist of repeated interventions over longer periods of time, focusing on effectiveness and relative costs.

AB  - Humans optimize behavior by deriving context-based expectations. Contextual data that are important for survival are extracted rapidly, using coarse information, adaptive decision strategies, and dedicated neural infrastructure. In the field of object perception, the influence of a surrounding context has been a major research theme, and it has generated a large literature. That visual context, as typically provided by natural scenes, facilitates object recognition as has been convincingly demonstrated (Bar, M. (2004) Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 5: 617-629). Just like objects, faces are generally encountered as part of a natural scene. Thus far, the facial expression literature has neglected such context and treats facial expressions as if they stand on their own. This constitutes a major gap in our knowledge. Facial expressions tend to appear in a context of head and body orientations, body movements, posture changes, and other object-related actions with a similar or at least a closely related meaning. For instance, one would expect a frightened face when confronted to an external danger to be at least accompanied by withdrawal movements of head and shoulders. Furthermore, some cues provided by the environment or the context in which a facial expression appears may have a direct relation with the emotion displayed by the face. The brain may even fill in the natural scene context typically associated with the facial expression. Recognition of the facial expression may also profit from processing the vocal emotion as well as the emotional body language that normally accompany it. Here we review the emerging evidence on how the immediate visual and auditory contexts influence the recognition of facial expressions.

AB  - The conscious recollection of unique personal experiences in terms of their details (what), their locale (where) and temporal occurrence (when) is known as episodic memory and is thought to require a 'self-concept', autonoetic awareness/conciousness, and the ability to subjectively sense time. It has long been held that episodic memory is unique to humans, because it was accepted that animals lack a 'self-concept', 'autonoetic awareness', and the ability to 'subjectively sense time'. These assumptions are now being questioned by behavioral evidence showing that various animal species indeed show behavioral manifestations of different features of episodic memory such as, e.g. 'metacognition', conscious recollection' of past events, 'temporal order memory', 'mental time travel' and have the capacity to remember personal experiences in terms of what happened, where and when. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview on the current progress in attempts to model different prerequisites and features of human episodic memory in animals and to identify possible neural substrates of animal episodic memory. The literature covered includes behavioral and physiological studies performed with different animal species, such as non-human primates, rodents, dolphins and birds. The search for episodic memory in animals has forced researchers to define objective behavioral criteria by which different features of episodic memory can be operationalized experimentally and assessed in both animals and humans. This is especially important because the current definition of episodic memory in terms of mentalistic constructs such as 'self', 'autonoetic awareness/consciousness', and 'subjectively sensed time', not only hinders animal research on the neurobiology of episodic memory but also research with healthy human subjects as well as neuropsychiatric patients with impaired language or in children with less-developed verbal abilities.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated to dementia in late adulthood. Amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes have been identified as causative genes for familial AD, whereas apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele has been associated to the risk for late onset AD. However, mutations on these genes do not explain the majority of cases. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) impairment has been detected in brain, muscle, fibroblasts and platelets of Alzheimer's patients, indicating a possible involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the aetiology of the disease. Several reports have identified mtDNA mutations in Alzheimer's patients, suggesting the existence of related causal factors probably of mtDNA origin, thus pointing to the involvement of mtDNA in the risk contributing to dementia, but there is no consensual opinion in finding the cause for impairment. However, mtDNA mutations might modify age of onset, contributing to the neurodegenerative process, probably due to an impairment of MRC and/or translation mechanisms.

These are initial steps in providing a much needed scientific basis to neurofeedback, but much remains to be done.

AB  - A current goal of affective neuroscience is to reveal the relationship between emotion and dynamic brain activity in specific neural circuits. In humans, noninvasive neuroimaging measures are of primary interest in this endeavor. However, methodological issues, unique to each neuroimaging method, have important implications for the design of studies, interpretation of findings, and comparison across studies. With regard to event-related brain potentials, we discuss the need for dense sensor arrays to achieve reference-independent characterization of field potentials and improved estimate of cortical brain sources. Furthermore, limitations and caveats regarding sparse sensor sampling are discussed. With regard to event-related magnetic field (ERF) recordings, we outline a method to achieve magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensor standardization, which improves effects' sizes in typical neuroscientific investigations, avoids the finding of ghost effects, and facilitates comparison of MEG waveforms across studies. Focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we question the unjustified application of proportional global signal scaling in emotion research, which can greatly distort statistical findings in key structures implicated in emotional processing and possibly contributing to conflicting results in affective neuroscience fMRI studies, in particular with respect to limbic and paralimbic structures. Finally, a distributed EEG/MEG source analysis with statistical parametric mapping is outlined providing a common software platform for hemodynamic and electromagnetic neuroimaging measures. Taken together, to achieve consistent and replicable patterns of the relationship between emotion and neuroimaging measures, methodological aspects associated with the various neuroimaging techniques may be of similar importance as the definition of emotional cues and task context used to study emotion.

AB  - Recently, research on the lateralization of linguistic and nonlinguistic (emotional) prosody has experienced a revival. However, both neuroimaging and patient evidence do not draw a coherent picture Substantiating right-hemi spheric lateralization of prosody and emotional prosody in particular. The current overview summarizes positions and data on the lateralization of emotion and emotional prosodic processing in the brain and proposes that: (1) the realization of emotional prosodic processing in the brain is based on differentially lateralized subprocesses and (2) methodological factors can influence the lateralization of emotional prosody in neuroimaging investigations. Latter evidence reveals that emotional valence effects are strongly right lateralized in studies using compact blocked presentation of emotional stimuli. In contrast, data obtained from event-related studies are indicative of bilateral or left-accented lateralization of emotional prosodic valence. These findings suggest a strong interaction between language and emotional prosodic processing.

AB  - The work concentrates on the problem of human emotions in healthy and pathologically changed brains, mainly in persons afflicted with schizophrenia or with organic impairments localized in one of the cerebral hemispheres. This chapter presents the state of current knowledge concerning the hemispheric lateralization of emotions among healthy people, psychiatric patients, and patients with one-sided brain lesion, on the basis of clinical observations, the results of experimental work, and the newest neuroimaging techniques. The numerous experiments and scientific methods used to assess the hemispheric lateralization of emotions and the discrepancies in their results point toward a lack of consistent theory in the field of hemispheric specialization in the regulation of emotional processes. Particular scientific interest was taken in the emotions of persons afflicted with schizophrenia, either in its early or late stages. This was inspired by the emotional behavior of schizophrenic patients on a psychiatric ward and their ability to perceive and express emotions during various stages of the schizophrenic process. In order to examine the cerebral manifestations of emotional deficits and the specialization of cerebral hemispheres for emotional processes, the author has described the emotional behavior of patients with unilateral cerebral stroke, i.e., patients with damage to the right or left cerebral hemisphere. Overall, the inferior performance of emotional tasks by right-hemisphere-damaged patients compared to other groups might support righthemisphere superiority for affect perception despite variations in the stimuli used.

AB  - Habituation to a novel environment in rodents is commonly defined as a change in exploratory or locomotor activity over time (intrasession) or with repeated exposures (intersession). While numerous neuroactive substances are known to influence habituation, neurotransmitters that play particularly important roles are serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine and glutamate. Although habituation is a complex process, studies over the past two decades have demonstrated that there is a genetic component. At present, although researchers are still attempting to isolate key genes that control habituation, findings in mutant mice have begun to highlight some of the genes that could play a role. The challenge will be in deciphering what genes are directly involved in the process of habituation, what genes indirectly influence habituation through a secondary mechanism, and what genes have no role in habituation but are only affected as part of the downstream cascade.

AB  - Endocannabinoids, acting via type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1), are known to be involved in short-term synaptic plasticity via retrograde signaling. Strong depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons is followed by the endocannabinoid-mediated activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors, which suppresses GABA and/or glutamate release. This phenomenon is termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) or excitation (DSE), respectively.
   Although both phenomena have been reported to be present in the basal ganglia, the anatomical substrate for these actions has not been clearly identified. Here we investigate the high-resolution subcellular localization of CB1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, striatum, globus pallidus and substantia nigra, as well as in the internal capsule, where the striato-nigral and pallido-nigral pathways are located.
   In all examined nuclei of the basal ganglia, we found that CB1 receptors were located on the membrane of axon terminals and preterminal axons. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the majority of these axon terminals were GABAergic, giving rise to mostly symmetrical synapses. Interestingly, preterminal axons showed far more intense staining for CB1, especially in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, whereas their terminals were only faintly stained. Non.. varicose, thin unmyelinated fibers in the internal capsule also showed strong CB1-labeling, and were embedded in bundles of myelinated CB1-negative axons. The majority of CB, receptors labeled by immunogold particles were located in the axonal plasma membrane (92.3%), apparently capable of signaling cannabinoid actions. CB, receptors in this location cannot directly modulate transmitter release, because the release sites are several hundred micrometers away. Interestingly, both the CB, agonist, WIN55,212-2, as well as its antagonist, AM251, were able to block action potential generation, but via a CB1 independent mechanism, since the effects remained intact in CB1 knockout animals. Thus, our electrophysiological data suggest that these receptors are unable to influence action potential propagation, thus they may not be functional at these sites, but are likely being transported to the terminal fields.
   The present data are consistent with a role of endocannabinoids in the control of GABA, but not glutamate, release in the basal ganglia via presynaptic CB, receptors, but also call the attention to possible non-CB1-mediated effects of widely used cannabinoid ligands on action potential generation.

AB  - Medial prefrontal cortex is a crucial region involved in inhibitory processes. Damage to the medial prefrontal cortex can lead to loss of normal inhibitory control over motor, sensory, emotional and cognitive functions. The goal of the present study was to examine the basic properties of inhibitory gating in this brain region in rats. Inhibitory gating has recently been proposed as a neurophysiological assay for sensory filters in higher brain regions that potentially enable or disable information throughput. This perspective has important clinical relevance due to the findings that gating is dramatically impaired in individuals with emotional and cognitive impairments (i.e. schizophrenia). We used the standard inhibitory gating two-tone paradigm with a 500 ms interval between tones and a 10 s interval between tone pairs. We recorded both single unit and local field potentials from chronic microwire arrays implanted in the medial prefrontal cortex. We investigated short-term (within session) and long-term (between session) variability of auditory gating and additionally examined how altering the interval between the tones influenced the potency of the inhibition. The local field potentials displayed greater variability with a reduction in the amplitudes of the tone responses over both the short and long-term time windows. The decrease across sessions was most intense for the second tone response (test tone) leading to a more robust gating (lower T/C ratio). Surprisingly, single unit responses of different varieties retained similar levels of auditory responsiveness and inhibition in both the short and long-term analysis. Neural inhibition decreased monotonically related to the increase in intertone interval. This change in gating was most consistent in the local field potentials. Subsets of single unit responses did not show the lack of inhibition even for the longer intertone intervals tested (4 s interval). These findings support the idea that the medial prefrontal cortex is an important site where early inhibitory functions reside and potentially mediate psychological processes. (c) 2006 IBRO.

AB  - Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO A and MAO B) are the major enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotaransmitters such as dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, and serotonin in the central and peripheral nervous systems. MAO B is mainly localized in glial cells. MAO B also oxidizes the xenobiotic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1.2.3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPP+) to a parkinsonism-producing neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+). MAO B may be closely related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), in which neuromelanin-containing DA neurons in the substantia nigra projecting to the striatum in the brain selectively degenerate. MAO B degrades the neurotransmitter DA that is deficient in the nigro-striatal region in PD, and forms H,02 and toxic aldehyde metabolites of DA. H2O2 produces highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Fenton reaction that is catalyzed by iron and neuromelanin. MAO B inhibitors such as L-(-)-deprenyl (selegiline) and rasagiline are effective for the treatment of PD. Concerning the mechanism of the clinical efficacy of MAO B inhibitors in PD, the inhibition of DA degradation (a symptomatic effect) and also the prevention of the formation of neurotoxic DA metabolites, i.e., ROS and dopamine derived aldehydes have been speculated. As;mother mechanism of clinical efficacy, MAO B inhibitors such as selegiline are speculated to have neuroprotective effects to prevent progress of PD. The possible mechanism of neuroprotection of MAO B inhibitors may be related not only to MAO B inhibition but also to induction and activation of multiple factors for anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis: i.e., catalase, superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, thioredoxin, Bcl-2, the cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and binding to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, it should be noted that selegiline increases production of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derivec neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrphic factor (GDNF), possibly from glial cells, to protect neurons from inflammatory process.

We further describe how regularity or local exponentiality of a Lie group can be used to obtain quite satisfactory answers to some of the fundamental problems. These results are illustrated by specialization to some specific classes of Lie groups, such as direct limit groups, linear Lie groups, groups of smooth maps and groups of diffeomorphisms.

AB  - Omega fatty acid treatment of depression is an unusual story in psychopharmacology in that the use and study of these compounds were advanced in cardiovascular disease before becoming of interest in psychiatry. Given the absence of an easily patentable derivative it is a tribute to the field that enough studies have accumulated for a reasonable review of omega-3 treatment of depression at this time. On the other hand, it is clearly not possible to compare the number of studies, variety of studies and the number of participants in each study with Federal Drug Administration style registration trials of patented antidepressant drugs. Most of the available studies of omega-3 in depression have been investigator initiated and use add-on design. This paper reviews 12 published and as yet unpublished clinical trials (all but one double-blind place-bocontrolled) of polyunsaturated fatty acids in unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and special populations with affective/ depressive disorders. While overall results up to this point are encouraging, they are not unanimously positive. Outstanding issues that have not as yet been resolved include the dose of omega-3 necessary and the length of time required for significant response. Moreover, the complex issue of the relationship between two possible active ingredients, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, remains unresolved.

AB  - Purpose: The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or "statins", are used as cholesterol-lowering agents worldwide. This review, focused on recent experimental and clinical data. summarizes general mechanisms of statin actions underlying neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and presents evidence for putative mechanisms involving heat shock proteins and the survival-related PI-3K/Akt pathway that may be beneficial for the treatment of neurological disorders.
   Methods: We carried out a medline search on statin actions, with respect to biochemical pathways and signal transduction on the one hand, and clinical studies in neurologic and retinal diseases on the other hand. Novel experimental data obtained in a rat model of axonal CNS injury were also included.
   Results: Statins exert multiple effects on endothelial function, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, immunological reactions, platelet function, and lipid oxidation. These "pleiotropic actions" are independent of cholesterol lowering and appear to be beneficial in the context of brain injury. Several mechanisms of statin actions underlying neuroprotective effects may also involve heat shock proteins and the survival-related PI-3K/Akt pathway.
   Conclusions: Available data suggest that statins may be of potential therapeutic use in a variety of diseases of the CNS including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and some forms of retinal and eye diseases. Before general recommendations can be made and specific therapeutic approaches can be developed, more reliable clinical data and studies are required, and possible side effects must be carefully evaluated.

AB  - A deeper understanding of how the brain processes visual information can be obtained by comparing results from complementary fields such as psychophysics, physiology, and computer science. In this chapter, empirical findings are reviewed with regard to the proposed mechanisms and representations for processing identity and emotion in faces. Results from psychophysics clearly show that faces are processed by analyzing component information (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) and their spatial relationship (configural information). Results from neuroscience indicate separate neural systems for recognition of identity and facial expression. Computer science offers a deeper understanding of the required algorithms and representations, and provides computational modeling of psychological and physiological accounts. An interdisciplinary approach taking these different perspectives into account provides a promising basis for better understanding and modeling of how the human brain processes visual information for recognition of identity and emotion in faces.

AB  - Non-adherence to treatment of patients with psychotic disorders is related to higher rates of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Important predictors of non-adherence include poor social structure, cognitive deficits, negative medication attitude, side effects, depression, a sealing-over recovery style, feelings of stigmatization, denial of treatment need, and lack of insight. Attempts to improve adherence have shown that psychoeducation alone is not fully effective, and that motivational interviewing, behavioral strategies, and linking a patient's personal goals to treatment may increase adherence. Based on the empirical data reviewed, we formed four clusters of possible causes of non-adherence, each of which can be targeted by a specific module of our developed Treatment Adherence Therapy (TAT). These four modules are: self-enhancement, motivational interviewing, medication dosage trials, and behavioral training. An individual patient may benefit from one or more of these modules; and thus the contents of TAT vary in accordance with individual causes of non-adherence. Basically, TAT aims to help patients work out what they want regarding treatment and then support them in following this through. TAT will be investigated in a multicenter randomized clinical trial in the Netherlands, starting March 2006.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders place a large burden not only on affected individuals and their families but also on societies and health services. Current treatment is only effective in a proportion of the patients, so considerable effort has been put into the development of new medications. The susceptibility to all major psychiatric disorders is, at least in part, genetic. Knowledge of the genes that underlie this susceptibility may lead to the identification of new drug targets and the development of more effective treatments. Therefore, numerous genetic studies in search for the genes involved in psychiatric disorders have been performed. Although results of both linkage and association studies have been inconsistent, several promising gene regions and candidate genes have been identified recently. In this article, we will review the strategies that proved to be successful in detecting genes for psychiatric disorders and we will provide some recommendations to increase the probability of detecting susceptibility genes in genetic studies of different designs.

AB  - During acoustic communication in humans, information about a speaker's emotional state is predominantly conveyed by modulation of the tone of voice (emotional or affective prosody). Based on lesion data, a right hemisphere superiority for cerebral processing of emotional prosody has been assumed. However, the available clinical studies do not yet provide a coherent picture with respect to interhemispheric lateralization effects of prosody recognition and intrahemispheric localization of the respective brain regions. To further delineate the cerebral network engaged in the perception of emotional tone, a series of experiments was carried out based upon functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The findings obtained from these investigations allow for the separation of three successive processing stages during recognition of emotional prosody: (1) extraction of suprasegmental acoustic information predominantly subserved by right-sided primary and higher order acoustic regions; (2) representation of meaningful suprasegmental acoustic sequences within posterior aspects of the right superior temporal sulcus; (3) explicit evaluation of emotional prosody at the level of the bilateral inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of specific emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli. As concerns lower level processing of the underlying suprasegmental acoustic cues, linguistic and emotional prosody seem to share the same right hemisphere neural resources. Explicit judgment of linguistic aspects of speech prosody, however, appears to be linked to left-sided language areas whereas bilateral orbitofrontal cortex has been found involved in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody. These differences in hemispheric lateralization effects might explain that specific impairments in nonverbal emotional communication subsequent to focal brain lesions are relatively rare clinical observations as compared to the more frequent aphasic disorders.

AB  - This paper reviews studies on neurophysiological and behavioral methods used to evaluate motor imagery accuracy. These methods can be used when performed in the field and are based on recordings of peripheral indices Such as autonomic nervous system or electromyographic activities, mental chronometry and psychological tests. Providing physiological signs that correlate to these types of mental processes may be considered in objective approach for motor imagery analysis. However, although autonomic nervous system activity recording has been shown to match motor imagery in real time, to evaluate its accuracy qualitatively and the individual ability to form mental images, the relationship between physiological responses and mental processes remains an inference. Moreover, electromyographic recordings may be associated with Postural control data, but due to inconsistent results, they remain insufficient to solely evaluate motor imagery accuracy. Other techniques traditionally used in psychology and cognitive psychology are questionnaires, "debriefing" With Subjects and mental chronometry. Although Such Methods lead to interesting results, there remains an important part of subjectivity as Subjects perform an autoevaluation of motor imagery accuracy. Similarly, mental chronometry gives information on the ability to preserve temporal organization of movement but does not allow the evaluation of the vividness of mental images. Thus, several methods should be combined to analyze motor imagery accuracy in greater detail. Neurophysiological recordings cannot therefore be considered an alternative but rather a complementary technique to behavioral and psychological methods. The advantages and inconvenient of each technique and the hypotheses that could be tested are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Empathy is a lay term that is becoming increasingly viewed as a unitary function within the field of cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, a selective review of the empathy literature is provided. It is argued from this literature that empathy is not a unitary system but rather a loose collection of partially dissociable neurocognitive systems. In particular, three main divisions can be made: cognitive empathy (or Theory of Mind), motor empathy, and emotional empathy. The two main psychiatric disorders associated with empathic dysfunction are considered autism and psychopathy. It is argued that individuals with autism show difficulties with cognitive and motor empathy but less clear difficulties with respect to emotional empathy. In contrast, individuals with psychopathy show clear difficulties with a specific form of emotional empathy but no indications of impairment with cognitive and motor empathy.

AB  - We introduce symbolic dynamics to cognitive scientists with the aim of furthering constructive debate on representation. Symbolic dynamics is a mathematical framework in which both continuous and discrete states of a system can be considered jointly. We discuss a number of theoretical implications this framework has for cognitive science, and offer some consideration of the way in which it might be employed for comparing or conciliating discrete and continuous representational theories. Symbolic dynamics may thus serve as a common, level playing field for debate in theories of cognitive representation.

AB  - Objective: There has been increased interest in the potential of early intervention to positively influence outcome in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and, consequently, to influence mental health policy and practice. This study's objective was to examine the concept of early intervention and the evidence that currently exists to support such a shift in the delivery of care.
   Method: We examined the evidence for phase-specific treatment of FEP, looking for interventions that attempt to arrest the transition from a putative prodromal state to full psychosis, as well as for interventions that attempt to reduce delay in treatment.
   Results: Some evidence supports specialized FEP interventions for short-term outcome in terms of symptom reduction, relapse rates, and greater adherence to and retention in treatment. As well, there is modest support for benefits to aspects of social and community functioning and satisfaction with life. Limited evidence supports a positive effect of community-wide case detection in terms of reduced delays in treatment and phannacologic and psychological interventions in the prodromal phase.
   Conclusions: The field of early intervention in psychosis is young, with encouraging preliminary results, especially for improving outcome in established FEP. It requires further study, especially of longer-term outcome. Further studies need to examine the effects of a specialized approach on longer-term outcome and to explore cost-effective methods to reduce delays in treatment and provide interventions in the prodromal phase.

AB  - The aim of our meta-analysis was to review the evidence base for the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic and antidepressant combinations in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. Randomized controlled trials comparing the combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics with antipsychotics alone for patients with pronounced negative symptoms in schizophrenia were searched for by accessing the register of randomized controlled trials of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group. The studies identified were independently inspected and their quality assessed by two reviewers. The principal outcome of interest was the reduction of negative symptoms. Dichotomous data were analyzed using the relative risk and continuous data were analyzed using standardized mean differences, both specified with 95% confidence intervals. It was possible to include seven trials (n = 202) examining antidepressants as add-on to antipsychotics in this review. Except for one study, all included studies used first generation antipsychotics. While there was often merely a trend in favour of augmentation of antipsychotics with antidepressants in the small single studies, the meta-analytic combination resulted in a statistically significant superiority in the outcome reduction of negative symptoms as a whole. Statistically significant differences between groups in terms of specific subscores of the SANS were found, but the results were inconsistent. The combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants may be more effective in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia than antipsychotics alone, but this finding needs to be corroborated by further large trials.

AB  - This contribution gives an overview on the state-of-the-art and recent advances in mixed integer optimization to solve planning and design problems in the process industry. In some case studies specific aspects are stressed and the typical difficulties of real world problems are addressed.
   Mixed integer linear optimization is widely used to solve supply chain planning problems. Some of the complicating features such as origin tracing and shelf life constraints are discussed in more detail. If properly done the planning models can also be used to do product and customer portfolio analysis.
   We also stress the importance of multi-criteria optimization and correct modeling for optimization under uncertainty. Stochastic programming for continuous LP problems is now part of most optimization packages, and there is encouraging progress in the field of stochastic MILP and robust MILP.
   Process and network design problems often lead to nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming models. If the time to compute the solution is not bounded, there are already a commercial solvers available which can compute the global optima of such problems within hours. If time is more restricted, then tailored solution techniques are required.

It focuses on primary themes of counseling psychology including the history of process-outcome research and multiculturalism. It explores current gaps in the literature from a counseling psychology framework, including the field's focus on normal and developmental challenges and tasks, client strength and resilience, education and career development, prevention and wellness, and multiculturalism. In general, current evidence indicates that online counseling may be a viable service option for some clients, especially those who are typically isolated; however, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of online counseling.

AB  - The progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressing degenerative disease belonging to the family of tauophaties, characterized by the involvement of both cortical and subcortical structures. Although the pathogenesis of PSP is still uncertain, genetic, biochemical, and immunohistochemical studies have been performed and are reviewed here. Genetic factors, oxidative damage, neurotoxins, and environmental factors contribute to tau deposition in the cerebral areas involved in PSP. Symptoms originate from the ensuing dysfunction of dopaminergic, GABAergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic pathways. Recent advances in neuroradiological and instrumental examinations facilitate the diagnosis and have gained new insights into the pathophysiology of PSP, although the primary cause of the disease is unknown and disease-modifying drugs are not yet available.

AB  - For decades, abnormalities in ceruloplasmin (Cp) synthesis have been associated with neurodegenerative disease. From the early observation that low circulating serum ceruloplasmin levels served as a marker for Wilson's disease to the recent characterization of a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a complete lack of serum ceruloplasmin, the link between Cp and neuropathology has strengthened. The mechanisms associated with these different central nervous system abnormalities are very distinct. In Wilson's disease, a defect in the P-type ATPase results in abnormal hepatic copper accumulation that eventually leaks into the circulation and is abnormally deposited in the brain. In this case, copper deposition results in the neurodegenerative phenotype observed. Patients with autosomal recessive condition, aceruloplasminemia, lack the ferroxidase activity inherent to the multi-copper oxidase ceruloplasmin and develop abnormal iron accumulation within the central nervous system. In the following review ceruloplasmin gene expression, structure and function will be presented and the role of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism will be discussed. The molecular events underlying the different forms of neurodegeneration observed will be presented. Understanding the role of ceruloplasmin within the central nervous system is fundamental to further our understanding of the pathology observed. Is the ferroxidase function more essential than the antioxidant role? Does Cp help maintain nitrosothiol stores or does it oxidize critical brain substrates? The answers to these questions hold the promise for the treatment of devastating neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It is essential to further elucidate the mechanism of the neuronal injury associated with these disorders. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Up to 40% of patients with schizophrenic psychoses have symptoms that are resistant to monotherapy with antipsychotic drugs. In consequence, combinations of drugs are often used, especially based on the antipsychotic agents clozapine and olanzapine because of their broad receptor-interaction profile. The aim of this review was to provide a critical overview of the published results of olanzapine augmentation. Methods: A systematic database search was performed of MEDLINE and BIOSIS (Ovid), looking for publications on augmented therapeutic approaches involving olanzapine. The search terms used were "augmentation," "combination," "schizophrenia," "olanzapine," and the names of other antipsychotic drugs and non-antipsychotic agents, including brand names, spanning publications from 1966 until the end of December 2004. Results: Of 14 reports dealing with 8 different antipsychotic augmentation strategies (83 patients), only 1 trial, of sulpiride - olanzapine therapy, was performed in a randomized manner. Based on clinical observation, a significant number of the treatments led to favourable results. In contrast to adjuvant therapy with antipsychotic drugs, augmentation of olanzapine with glycine, antidepressants or mood stabilizers was evaluated in well-designed clinical trials (8 publications, 989 patients), with distinct improvements of positive and/or negative symptoms reported. Conclusions: The combination of olanzapine with antidopaminergic atypical antipsychotic agents seems to follow a neurobiological rationale. The augmentation trials with non-antipsychotic agents, for example, mood stabilizers, were successful and showed that randomized and placebo- controlled trials are feasible. Therefore, systematic evaluations of antipsychotic agents as adjuvant therapy are possible as well as necessary to determine the benefits and risks of any new treatment strategy.

These advances, combined with a new understanding of the rich distribution and diverse physiological roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the basal ganglia, indicate that these receptors might have a key role in motor control and raise the exciting possibility that they might provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

An overview of the diverse expressions of the philosophical counseling movement is provided, including scope of practice, methods, training curriculum, codes of ethics, and evidence of effectiveness. The field is critically analyzed: Philosophical counseling is not currently a viable alternative to mental health treatment. Carefully conducted and appropriately focused philosophical counseling may, however, help some individuals or groups. To clarify whether philosophical counseling may benefit a particular individual with a given problem, psychologists (and potential clients) thus need to carefully evaluate individual philosophical counselors.

AB  - Moral cognitive neuroscience is an emerging field of research that focuses on the neural basis of uniquely human forms of social cognition and behaviour. Recent functional imaging and clinical evidence indicates that a remarkably consistent network of brain regions is involved in moral cognition. These findings are fostering new interpretations of social behavioural impairments in patients with brain dysfunction, and require new approaches to enable us to understand the complex links between individuals and society. Here, we propose a cognitive neuroscience view of how cultural and context-dependent knowledge, semantic social knowledge and motivational states can be integrated to explain complex aspects of human moral cognition.

AB  - alpha-Synuclein is a pre-synaptic protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, we demonstrated that 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) induces caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation of PKC delta, which subsequently contributes to neuronal apoptotic cell death in mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cells [50,96]. In the present study, we examined whether PKC delta interacts with alpha-synuclein to modulate MPP+-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Over-expression of wild-type human alpha-synuclein in mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cells (N27 cells) attenuated MPP+-induced (300 mu M) cytotoxicity, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and subsequent caspase-3 activation, without affecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Wild-type alpha-synuclein over-expression also dramatically reduced MPP+-induced caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage of PKC delta, whereas overexpression of the mutant human alpha-synuclein(A53T) did not alter the PKC delta cleavage under similar conditions. Immunoprecipitation-kinase assay revealed reduced PKC delta kinase activity in wild-type alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells in response to MPP+ treatment. Wild-type alpha-synuclein over-expression also rescued mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cells from MPP+-induced apoptotic cell death, while alpha-synuclein(A53T) exacerbated the MPP+-induced DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that alpha-synuclein interacts with the pro-apoptotic proteins PKC delta and BAD, but not with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 following MPP+ treatment. We also observed that the interaction between PKC delta and alpha-synuclein does not involve direct phosphorylation. Together, our results demonstrate that wild-type alpha-synuclein interacts with the pro-apoptotic molecules BAD and PKC delta to protect dopaminergic neuronal cells against neurotoxic insults.

AB  - A substantial body of research has established that even when we are not consciously aware of the faces of others we are nevertheless sensitive to, and impacted by their facial expression. In this paper, we consider this body of research from a new perspective by examining the functions of unconscious perception revealed by these studies. A consideration of the literature from this perspective highlights that existing research methods are limited when it comes to revealing possible functions of unconscious perception. The critical shortcoming is that in all of the methods, the perceived facial expression remains outside of awareness. This is a problem because there are good reasons to believe that one important function of unconsciously perceived negative faces is to attract attention so that they are consciously perceived; such conscious perception, however, is never allowed with existing methodologies. We discuss recent studies of emotional face perception under conditions of visual search that address this issue directly. Further, we suggest that methodologies that do not examine cognitive processes as they occur in more natural settings may result in fundamental misunderstandings of human cognition.

AB  - Objectives: With the development of less invasive treatments, the suitability of hysterectomy as a treatment for benign symptoms is being reevaluated. This paper critically and comprehensively reviews the psychosocial outcomes of hysterectomy in areas of sexuality, pain, and psychological functioning. Methods: Medline, Pub Med, and PsychLit were searched for studies and reviews pertaining to the psychosocial outcomes of hysterectomy. Over 100 studies and reviews, in English, French, and German language, published in the past 30 years were included. Controversial theories and empirical evidence are discussed in the domains of sexuality, pain, and psychological well-being. Special attention is devoted to design, sampling, and measurement issues as well as different surgical approaches with regard to hysterectomy-oophorectomy. Results: While hysterectomy appears to reduce pain, there do not appear strong psychosexual or psychosocial effects. Nonetheless, there may be a subgroup of women (10-20%) who report negative psychosocial outcomes such as reduced sexual interest, arousal, and orgasm, as well as elevated depressive symptoms and impaired body image. Conclusions: More research is necessary to establish which patients may benefit most and which may not. Directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Since this is the first time the field has been reviewed in this journal, attention will be paid to the history of the field, not just recent findings.
   Recent findings Research has chiefly, but not exclusively, tackled (i) the spatial epidemiology of mental ill-health and (ii) the changing locational associations of mental health care.
   Summary This review has concentrated chiefly on contributions to this field of inquiry made by researchers with a background in the academic discipline of geography. While there are 'geographical' contributions made by workers from other disciplinary backgrounds, there is arguably something distinctive, particularly in the most recent scholarship, arising from a theorized sensitivity to the entangled relations of mental health, society, space and environment.

AB  - Additive or multiplicative models of crop response on which salinity management theory have been developed may lead to an erroneous perception regarding compensative interaction among salinity and other growth factors. We present results from studies of biomass production and transpiration of corn (Zea mays L. cv. Jubilee), melon (Cucumis melo L. subsp. meto cv. Galia), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. 5656), onion (Allium cepa L. cv. HA 944), and date palms (Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Medjool) under salinity combined with water or nitrate (growth promoters) or with boron (growth inhibitor). The measured crop responses were to the more severe stress rather than to combinations of the individual effects of the various stresses. Consequences of shifting management of saline water to a dominant factor approach include reduction of environmental contamination and conservation of water resources.

In particular, the similarity of the combinatorics involved with those of generalized exclusion statistics (Gentile's intermediate statistics) is stressed. It is shown that the dimensions of the algebras of generalized grassmann variables are related to generalized Fibonacci numbers. On the analytical side, some of the simplest differential equations are discussed and a suitably generalized Berezin integral as well as an associated delta-function are considered. Some remarks concerning a geometrical interpretation of recent results about fractional superconformal transformations involving generalized grassmann variables are given. Finally, a quantity related to the Witten index is discussed.

AB  - Drugs acting at dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are commonly used to alleviate symptoms produced by diseases such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. A limitation to the use of these drugs is that they sometimes afflict patients with severe side effects. This review discusses recent evidence for several proteins that represent novel mediators of the downstream consequences of D2R activation, since selective targeting of particular D2R-mediated signaling pathways could lead to the development of improved treatments for these devastating diseases.

AB  - Bipolar disorders are prevalent in women. Women with bipolar disorder often present with different clinical features than men. Reproductive events and hormonal treatments may impact the course of bipolar disorder. Our main objectives are to i) assess the impact of reproductive events on the course of the disorder, and ii) to discuss the relationships between reproductive events and psychiatric treatments.
   A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE journals from 1965 to present. Manual literature searches were also conducted. We review the presentation, clinical course, and treatment considerations of bipolar disorder in women, with emphasis on treatment considerations in the context of reproductive events. Treatment-related issues such as teratogenicity, breastfeeding, polycystic ovarian syndrome, weight gain and obesity, and medication interactions with oral contraceptives are reviewed.
   Women with bipolar disorder may be more vulnerable to mood episodes in the context of reproductive events, particularly postpartum. In women of reproductive age, mood stabilizers must be selected with teratogenic risks in mind, with the highest reported risks in pregnancy with valproate, and the greatest concern during breastfeeding with lithium use. In the areas of the perimenopause and polycycstic ovarian syndrome, more data are needed to advise treatment decisions.
   We urgently need further study in these areas to deliver care that is appropriate to women with bipolar disorder.

AB  - Research related to the ecological risk management of sediment stress in watersheds is placed under a common conceptual framework in order to help promote the timely advance of decision support methods for aquatic resource managers and watershed-level planning. The proposed risk management research program relies heavily on model development and verification, and should be applied under an adaptive management approach. The framework is centered on using best management practices (BMPs), including eco-restoration. It is designed to encourage the development of numerical representations of the performance of these management options, the integration of this information into sediment transport simulation models that account for uncertainty in both input and output, and would use strategic environmental monitoring to guide sediment-related risk management decisions for mixed land use watersheds. The goal of this project was to provide a sound scientific framework based on recent state of the practice in sediment-related risk assessment and management for research and regulatory activities, As a result, shortcomings in the extant data and measurement and modeling tools were identified that can help determine future research direction. The compilation of information is beneficial to the coordination of related work being conducted within and across entities responsible for managing watershed-scale risks to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome, primarily manifest during wakefulness, intrude into sleep. There are some disorders, however, such as periodic limb movements in sleep, restless legs syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia, bruxism, and somnambulism, which occur primarily during sleep. The diagnosis and management of these disorders pose a challenge to neuropsychiatric practice, not only because they may be difficult to distinguish from other neuropsychiatric disorders, but also because psychiatric disorders are often co-morbid with them. Study of these disorders is necessary for an understanding of the interaction of sleep and movement, and how disturbance in one may affect the other.

AB  - Sleep should not be considered a behavioural state characterized by brain inertia; instead, it is a highly dynamic process involving numerous brainstem areas and all physiological systems of the body. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for sleep regulation has considerably advanced since the discovery of rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep, about half a century ago. Based on standardized electroencephalographic, electro-oculographic and electromyographic features, two distinct main states periodically alternating throughout the night have been identified: REM and non-REM sleep; the latter is further distinguished into stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. Computerized analysis of sleep recordings yielded more detailed information on sleep physiology and pathology. Although still preliminary, neuroimaging studies promise to elucidate the functional alterations of neuronal substrates during sleep. Regarding sleep disorders, which account for a substantial individual and socio-economic burden, considerable progress has been achieved in terms of their classification, assessment, clinical diagnosis and treatment. Specific sleep disorders within the three major categories, that is, 'dysomnias', 'parasomnias', and 'sleep disorders associated with mental, neurologic, or other medical conditions', exhibit characteristic clinical features; sleep laboratory recordings considerably assist to definitely diagnose several among them. Pertinence of sleep medicine for psychiatrists is obvious, taking into consideration that psychiatric disorders account for the largest diagnostic group of patients with sleep problems. In fact, the basics of this interdisciplinary field should be of special concern both to medical students and clinicians of diverse backgrounds who are interested in acquiring the necessary skills to globally and comprehensively understand and eventually effectively treat their patients.

AB  - We introduce a novel spacetime reduction procedure for the fields of a supergravity-Yang-Mills theory in generic curved spacetime background, and with large N flavor group, to linearized forms on an infinitesimal patch of local tangent space at a point in the spacetime manifold. Our new prescription for spacetime reduction preserves all of the local symmetries of the continuum field theory Lagrangian in the resulting zero-dimensional matrix Lagrangian, thereby obviating difficulties encountered in previous matrix proposals for emergent spacetime in recovering the full nonlinear symmetries of Einstein gravity. It also obviates the challenges that must be faced by any proposal for a fundamental theory, holographic or topological, where gravity emerges instead as an induced interaction. We conjecture that the zero-dimensional matrix model obtained by this prescription for spacetime reduction of the circle-compactified type I-I'-mIIA-IIB-heterotic supergravity-Yang-Mills theory with sixteen supercharges and large N flavor group, and inclusive of the full spectrum of Dp-brane charges, -2 <= p <= 9, offers a potentially complete framework for nonperturbative String/M theory. We analyze the matrix Lagrangian in detail, comparing with the results of traditional planar reduction, and clarifying the emergence of the spacetime continuum in the large N limit of the zero-dimensional matrix model. We explain the relationship of our conjecture for a fundamental theory of emergent local spacetime geometry to recent investigations of the hidden symmetry algebra of M theory, stressing insights that are to be gained from the algebraic perspective. We conclude with a list of open questions and directions for future work. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A meta-analysis of worldwide studies, found by a 10-year literature follow-up and/or by searching PubMed, was performed. Forty-two studies across 20 nations consistently demonstrated an association between schizophrenia and current smoking (weighted average odds ratio, OR=5.9; 95% confidence interval, CI 4.9-5.7). In 32 male studies across 18 nations, the weighted average OR was 7.2 (CI, 6.1-8.3). In 25 female studies across 15 nations, the weighted average OR was 3.3 (CI, 3.03.6). The association between schizophrenia and current smoking remained after using severe mentally ill controls (18 studies across 9 countries, weighted average OR was 1.9, CI 1.7-2.1) and controlling for other variables (3 studies, adjusted ORs ranged 2-3).
   Heavy smoking (6 studies across 4 countries, ORs ranged 1.9-6.4) and high nicotine dependence were more frequent in smokers with schizophrenia versus the general population. There was no consistent evidence that heavy smoking or high nicotine dependence was more frequent in smokers with schizophrenia versus severe mentally ill controls. Cessation rates were lower in schizophrenia smokers versus the general population.
   Schizophrenia patients had a higher prevalence of ever smoking than the general population (9 studies across 6 countries, weighted average OR=3.1, CI 2.4-3.8) and than severe mentally ill patients (5 studies across 5 countries, OR=2.0, CI 1.6-2.4). Moreover, in two studies adjusting for confounders schizophrenia patients had an increased risk of starting daily smoking than controls. Thus, people who are going to develop schizophrenia have risk factors that make them more vulnerable to start smoking. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Today, the placebo effect represents a promising model that could allow us to shed new light on mind - body interactions. The mental events induced by placebo administration can activate mechanisms that are similar to those activated by drugs, which indicates a similarity between psychosocial and pharmacodynamic effects. These new neurobiological advances are already changing our conception of how clinical trials and medical practice must be viewed and conducted.

AB  - We analyze in detail the relation between an exactly marginal deformation of N = 4 SYM - the Leigh-Strassler or "beta-deformation" - and its string theory dual ( recently constructed in hep-th/0502086) by comparing energies of semiclassical strings to anomalous dimensions of gauge-theory operators in the two-scalar sector. We stress the existence of integrable structures on the two sides of the duality. In particular, we argue that the integrability of strings in AdS(5) x S-5 implies the integrability of the deformed world sheet theory with real deformation parameter. We compare the fast string limit of the worldsheet action in the sector with two angular momenta with the continuum limit of the coherent state action of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain describing the one-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators and find a remarkable agreement for all values of the deformation parameter. We discuss some of the properties of the Bethe Ansatz for this spin chain, solve the Bethe equations for small number of excitations and comment on higher loop properties of the dilatation operator. With the goal of going beyond the leading order in the 't Hooft expansion we derive the analog of the Bethe equations on the string-theory side, and show that they coincide with the thermodynamic limit of the Bethe equations for the spin chain. We also compute the 1/J corrections to the anomalous dimensions of operators with large R-charge ( corresponding to strings with angular momentum J) and match them to the 1-loop corrections to the fast string energies. Our results suggest that the impressive agreement between the gauge theory and semiclassical strings in AdS5 x S5 is part of a larger picture underlying the gauge/gravity duality.

AB  - A systematic review was undertaken of scientifically rigorous studies of family-based services in children's health and mental health. From a pool of over 4000 articles since 1980 in health and mental health that examined either specific family-based interventions for families of children or the processes of involvement, 41 studies were identified that met the methodological criteria for inclusion. These 41 studies encompassed 3 distinct categories: families as recipients of interventions (e.g., family education, support, engagement, empowerment); (b) families as co-therapists; and (c) studies of the processes of involvement (e.g., therapeutic alliance, engagement, empowerment, expectancies, and choice). Too few experimental studies exist to conclude decisively that family-based services improve youth clinical outcomes. However, those studies that have been rigorously examined demonstrate unequivocal improvements in other types of outcomes, such as retention in services, knowledge about mental health issues, self-efficacy, and improved family interactions - all outcomes that are essential ingredients of quality care. Four implications are drawn from this review. (1) Effective family education and support interventions from studies of adults with mental illnesses and from studies of families of high-risk infants exist and can be imported into the field of children's mental health. (2) The range of outcomes that are typically assessed in clinical treatment studies is too narrow to afford an adequate view of the impact of family-based interventions. A broader view of outcomes is needed. (3) The absence of a robust literature on process variables other than therapeutic alliance limits conclusions about how and why interventions are effective. Attention to the processes by which families become involved in services will require a more robust and nuanced range of studies that attend simultaneously to processes of change and to outcome improvement. (4) Linkage of effective family-based interventions to delivery of evidence-based services is likely to amplify the impact of those services and improve outcomes for youth and families.

AB  - Purpose: General hospital psychiatric services are able to provide leadership and coordinate the development of suicide prevention programs for individuals serviced in general hospital settings. We completed this literature review to suggest priorities for programming.
   Methods: Our procedure was to update the review by Gunnell and Frankel that guided priorities for Health of the Nation, the national suicide prevention strategy in the UK. We completed a search, using the terms suicide prevention and control, of all English-language research and clinical trials conducted between January 1, 1994, and May 1, 2004.
   Results: We identified 82 papers. Of these, 48 were excluded and the remaining 34 were grouped by secondary care setting categories. We found no articles on screening tools for predicting risk of suicide, 16 articles on interventions for individuals with suicidal behaviour, 14 articles on the treatment of major psychiatric disorders, I article and 1 published abstract on discharge from hospital, and 2 articles on reducing access to means.
   Conclusions: Based on a review of each category, we make several program and policy recommendations, including regularly updating clinical assessment skills, using guidelines for assessment of patients following a suicide attempt, assessing the risk of suicide 24 to 48 hours before discharge from hospital, and incorporating education about reducing access to means into routine psychiatric care.

AB  - During recent years there has been a growing interest on several aspects regarding psychopathology in general and particularly with personality disorders, such as dual psychopathology, comorbidity and dimensional models. Going from the Eysenck's three-factor model to the Fiske's five-factor one, from the Cloninger's psychobiological model to the Millon's biosocial one, a wide variety of personality analysis models, as well as dimensions to which the different personality disorders should be anchored, have been proposed.
   Here, we propose a dimensional model for personality disorders based on DSM-IV criteria, which are cognitive style (field dependence-independence), prevalent emotion (anger-fear), interpersonal style (submissiveness-dominance), and impulse control (impulsiveness-compulsiveness). We consider that these dimensions are related to different levels of cerebral complexity, assuming that evolution operates under the redundancy principle. Based on these dimensions, a bimodal model in which antisocial personality (high field dependence, anger, dominance, and impulsiveness) and schizotypal personality (low field dependence, fear, submissiveness, and compulsiveness) would be anchored in each extreme is proposed. Between these two extremes, the rest of personality disorders, such as borderline, paranoid, narcissist, histrionic, dependent, passive-aggressive, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, and schizoid, would be anchored.

KW  - consciousness

KW  - neuropsychology
KW  - quantum mechanics
AB  - Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behaviour generally posits that brain mechanisms will ultimately suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can therefore be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Thus, terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or experiential content (e.g. 'feeling', 'knowing' and 'effort') are not included as primary causal factors. This theoretical restriction is motivated primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incorrect for more than three-quarters of a century. Contemporary basic physical theory differs profoundly from classic physics on the important matter of how the consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone can account for the structure of all observed empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly and irreducibly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience, and it provides neuroscientists and psychologists with an alternative conceptual framework for describing neural processes. Indeed, owing to certain structural features of ion channels critical to synaptic function, contemporary physical theory must in principle be used when analysing human brain dynamics. The new framework, unlike its classic-physics-based predecessor, is erected directly upon, and is compatible with, the prevailing principles of physics. It is able to represent more adequately than classic concepts the neuroplastic mechanisms relevant to the growing number of empirical studies of the capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain function.

Each model is considered both with respect to the psychopathy data and, more importantly, for the present purposes, with respect to the broader cognitive neuroscience fields to which the model refers (e.g., models of attention with respect to the response set modulation account and models of emotion with respect to the fear dysfunction and violence inhibition mechanism models). The paper concludes with an articulation of the more recent integrated emotion systems model, an account inspired both by recent findings in affective cognitive neuroscience as well as in the study of psychopathy. Some directions for future work are considered.

PES literature was identified by performing a MEDLINE search. The author was interested in studies or reviews of all types of PES. The refereed research, consisting of 85 articles, is a representation of the existing literature as multiple studies were found to be similar in topic and methodology. This review is organized using Donabedian's structure, process, outcome framework to describe research that has examined 1) providers, clients, and services; 2) variations in access, utilization, evaluation, treatment, and continuity of care; and 3) outcomes of these services. The resulting report reveals methodological limitations that are pervasive throughout the PES literature, dimensions of psychiatric emergency services that remain unexplored, and a PES research agenda.

AB  - This paper provides a brief review of the literature on inter-group relations and coping. It aims to try and bring together arguments for treating inter-group behaviours as coping activities. Differences and similarities between the two corpuses are considered. Some evidence for our proposal is also presented in terms of (a) search for similarity, (b) social comparison (and whether or not it is upward or downward comparison), and (c) links between emotions and inter-group relations. The concluding comments leave the matter open to further discussion and evidence but raise the question of the role of emotions and coping with those emotions in group-to-group positive and negative relations. We also raise the possibility that conflict management and resolution could operate as interventions based on cognitive-behavioural practices.

AB  - Quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) are state-independent lower bounds on weighted averages of the stress-energy tensor, and have been established for several free quantum field models. We present rigorous QEI bounds for a class of interacting quantum fields, namely the unitary, positive energy conformal field theories (with stress-energy tensor) on two-dimensional Minkowski space. The QEI bound depends on the weight used to average the stress-energy tensor and the central charge(s) of the theory, but not on the quantum state. We give bounds for various situations: averaging along timelike, null and spacelike curves, as well as over a space-time volume. In addition, we consider boundary conformal field theories and more general "moving mirror" models.

AB  - This Article analyzes how communitarian political theory addresses poverty and impacts American social welfare programs. For several decades, communitarian and liberal philosophers have debated over how best to achieve justice through their competing notions of personhood Whereas liberal theorists stress the values of individual autonomy and state neutrality, communitarians assert that people are socially constituted and that liberalism therefore pays too little attention to the value of community. Yet despite their attempts to articulate a superior form of justice, communitarian theorists either ignore or misunderstand issues related to poverty, as this Article explains. Nevertheless, their insights are helpful in thinking about combating inequity. Not only does communitarian theory support collective responsibility for alleviating economic injustice, but it also provides a framework for moving away from individual blame as an explanation for poverty. Current welfare law is based on the idea that individual behavior and choices cause poverty. As a result, welfare recipients are required to work without adequate social and economic supports to enable self-sufficiency, and most remain mired in poverty. By contrast, this Article describes an alternative, pragmatic vision for welfare that builds upon the social capital that exists within distressed urban communities as a way to improve individual outcomes.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule with pleiotropic effects in different tissues. NO is synthesized by NO synthases (NOS), a family with four major types: endothelial, neuronal, inducible and mitochondrial. They can be found in almost all the tissues and they can even co-exist in the same tissue. NO is a well-known vasorelaxant agent, but it works as a neurotransmitter when produced by neurons and is also involved in defense functions when it is produced by immune and glial cells. NO is thermodynamically unstable and tends to react with other molecules, resulting in the oxidation, nitrosylation or nitration of proteins, with the concomitant effects on many cellular mechanisms. NO intracellular signaling involves the activation of guanylate cyclase but it also interacts with MAPKs, apoptosis-related proteins, and mitochondrial respiratory chain or anti-proliferative molecules. It also plays a role in post-translational modification of proteins and protein degradation by the proteasome. However, under pathophysiological conditions NO has damaging effects. In disorders involving oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Parkinson's disease, NO increases cell damage through the formation of highly reactive peroxynitrite. The paradox of beneficial and damaging effects of NO will be discussed in this review. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Among the many pathogenic mechanisms thought to contribute to the demise of these cells, dopamine-dependent oxidative stress has classically taken center stage due to extensive experimental evidence showing that dopamine-derived reactive oxygen species and oxidized dopamine metabolites are toxic to nigral neurons. In recent years, however, the involvement of neuro-inflammatory processes in nigral degeneration has gained increasing attention. Not only have activated microglia and increased levels of inflammatory mediators been detected in the striatum of deceased PD patients, but a large body of animal studies points to a contributory role of inflammation in dopaminergic cell loss. Recently, postmortem examination of human subjects exposed to the parkinsonism-inducing toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), revealed the presence of activated microglia decades after drug exposure, suggesting that even a brief pathogenic insult can induce an ongoing inflammatory response. Perhaps not surprisingly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to reduce the risk of developing PD. In the past few years, various pathways have come to light that could link dopamine-dependent oxidative stress and microglial activation, finally ascribing a pathogenic trigger to the chronic inflammatory response characteristic of PD.

AB  - This Article posits the existence and pervasiveness of an official public (or State) memory that is primarily constructed using public law devices and statements Of official policy. While official public memory serves the purposes of social control and stability, it also seeks to mask contestation and is, accordingly, neither complete nor authentic. Using philosophical, scientific, and literary sources, this Article demonstrates how the affective (emotional) memory that is unique to individuals creates a permanent potential for contestation and authenticity and therefore sets a natural conceptual limit to the power of officially managed memory to contrive the past. To help establish this Article's initial claim, Part I provides as an illustration of the phenomenon of official public memory the legal and policy means by which the Austrian government sustains an official public memory of Austria as a victim State of Nazi aggression. Part H builds upon the Austrian illustration as well as examples from other States to expose the characteristic patterns-selectivity, constructivism, mythmaking (mythopoesis), incorporation, and presentism-by which government elites create and maintain a contrived ideological account of the past. It shows how States exploit law and the legal process in this task. In response to Parts I and 11, the remainder of this Article (Parts III-V) is a search for a concept of public memory that provides a more contested (and authentic) account of the past, and thus a challenge to the law-sustained contrivance of official public memory. Others have sought to open up contestation by proposing actions that occur entirely within the construct of law and legal institutions. This Article broadens the inquiry by seeking to support contestation (and authenticity) using the work of other disciplines. Part III begins this quest for an alternative discourse by exploring the discipline of history, which is characterized by archivistic efforts to discover the "true" past. History's unending revisionism, however, makes it unlikely to serve the purposes of social control and stability that give official memory its power. And history's relativist biases makes it no more likely than official memory to create a broadly accurate portrait of the past. Part IV considers whether social philosophy offers a more accessible paradigm of public memory, one that is grounded in the lived experience of individuals. In particular, Part IV draws on the concept of non-official "collective memory" expounded by French social philosopher Maurice Halbwachs as an alternative account of public memory. But this, too, is deficient as an authentic counterpoint to official public memory, because Halbwachs fails to exclude the effects of that very contrivance from his theory. Nor, importantly, does he account in his social theory of memory for a unique feature of individual lived experience, the scientifically verified condition of emotional or affective memory. Part V seeks to use literature, and in particular the theory of transcendent memory offered by Marcel Proust in In Search of Lost Time, to meet the ontological challenge of demonstrating how affective memory is the feature of individual lived experience that is most likely to sustain a reconceptualized public memory. By representing affective memory as an autonomous condition, this Article sets a cognitive, definitional, and even scientific limit to the power of official memory.
   Rather than finding a discourse to displace official public memory, therefore, this Article reaches the reassuring conclusion tat affective memory allows an understanding of official public memory as intrinsically confronting a potential for contestation, and therefore for authenticity.

This article reviews the most recent findings and the emerging picture in the genetics of bipolar disorder.

AB  - Objective: Mortality risk in offspring of parents with psychotic disorders is a sensitive and important topic, but evidence on which to base plans for preventive services is limited. The authors synthesized evidence for mortality risk among offspring of parents with psychotic disorders and examined potential modifiers of risk such as offspring age and parental diagnosis.
   Method: Electronic reference and citation databases were searched. Secondary analyses were carried out to generate relative risk estimates and perform post hoc statistical power calculations. A meta-analysis of the association between maternal psychotic disorder and fetal death/stillbirth was conducted.
   Results: Most of the relevant studies investigated the relationship between exposure to maternal schizophrenia and perinatal or infant mortality outcomes but were not truly population- based and lacked adequate power. Studies published since 1960 generally indicated higher than expected mortality risk in exposed offspring. Meta-analysis indicated an almost twofold higher risk of fetal death/stillbirth among offspring of women with psychoses. Notable gaps in the existing evidence include outcome beyond the first year of life, cause-specific mortality, and effects of exposure to specific parental conditions other than schizophrenia and of exposure to paternal versus maternal disorder. Etiological mechanisms are not fully understood.
   Conclusions: Large-scale population-based studies are needed to understand mortality risk in offspring of parents with psychoses. In the absence of etiological evidence, only general preventive measures can be taken. Prevention of offspring mortality at an early age is most likely to be achieved by identification and treatment of maternal disorder and greater provision of support to these vulnerable families.

AB  - Mental preparation aids performance and induces multiple physiological changes that should inform concepts of preparation. To date, however, these changes have been interpreted as being due to a global preparatory process (e.g., attention or alertness). The authors review psychophysiological and performance investigations of preparation. Concepts of the central regulation of action offer an integrative framework for understanding the psychophysiology of preparation. If people process multiple streams of information concurrently, then preparatory processing requires a form of supervisory attention-central regulation to maintain unity of action. This concept is consistent with existing psychophysiological results and links them to current views of information processing. Conversely, psychophysiological measures may provide indices to test concepts within theories of the central regulation of action.

   Method: A systematic search to identify studies evaluating a psychological intervention with adults with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder who had not responded to at least one course of antidepressant medication.
   Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which four were controlled and eight uncontrolled. Treatment effect sizes were computable for four studies and ranged from 1.23 to 3.10 with a number of better quality studies demonstrating some improvements in patients following a psychological intervention.
   Conclusion: Psychological treatments for depression are commonly delivered and often recommended following the failure of medication. The paucity of evidence for their effectiveness in these situations is a significant problem. There is a need for studies with a strong controlled design investigating the effectiveness of psychological treatments for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - This paper reviews the potential of trace/heavy metal-induced stress to reduce plant frost hardiness at northern high latitudes. The scientific questions are first outlined prior to a brief summary of heavy metal tolerance. The concepts of plant capacity and survival adaptation were used to formulate a hypothesis, according to which heavy metal stress may reduce plant frost hardiness for the following reasons: (1) Heavy metals change membrane properties through impaired resource acquisition and subsequent diminution of the cryoprotectant pool. (2) Heavy metals change membrane properties directly through oxidative stress, i.e. an increase of active oxygen species. (3) The involved co-stress may further increase oxidative stress. (4) The risk of frost injury increases due to membrane alterations. An opposite perspective was also discussed: could metal stress result in enhanced plant frost hardiness? This phenomenon could be based on the metabolism (i.e. glutathione, polyamines, proline, heat shock proteins) underlying a possible general adaptation syndrome of stress (GAS). As a result of the review it was suggested that metal-induced stress seems to reduce rather than increase plant frost hardiness. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - People show a left visual field (LVF) bias for faces, i.e., involving the right hemisphere of the brain. Lesion and neuroimaging studies confirm the importance of the right-hemisphere and suggest separable neural pathways for processing facial identity vs. emotions. We investigated the hemispheric processing of faces in adults with and without Asperger syndrome (AS) using facial emotion and identity chimeric tasks. Controls showed an LVF bias in both tasks, but no perceptual bias in a non-social control task. The AS group showed an LVF bias during both tasks, however the bias was reduced in the identity condition. Further, the AS group showed an LVF bias in the non-social condition. These results show a differential pattern of hemispheric processing of faces in AS.

AB  - Inferences about spatial, temporal, and other relations are ubiquitous. This article presents a novel model-based theory of such reasoning. The theory depends on 5 principles. (a) The structure of mental models is iconic as far as possible. (b) The logical consequences of relations emerge from models constructed from the meanings of the relations and from knowledge. (c) Individuals tend to construct only a single, typical model. (d) They spontaneously develop their own strategies for relational reasoning. (e) Regardless of strategy, the difficulty of an inference depends on the process of integration of the information from separate premises, the number of entities that have to be integrated to form a model, and the depth of the relation. The article describes computer implementations of the theory and presents experimental results corroborating its main principles.

AB  - We propose additional conditions (beyond those considered in our previous papers) that should be imposed on Wick products and time-ordered products of a free quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. These conditions arise from a simple "Principle of Perturbative Agreement": for interaction Lagrangians L-1 that are such that the interacting field theory can be constructed exactly - as occurs when L-1 is a "pure divergence" or when L-1 Is at most quadratic in the field and contains no more than two derivatives - then time-ordered products must be defined so that the perturbative solution for interacting fields obtained from the Bogoliubov formula agrees with the exact solution. The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the Leibniz rule (or "action Ward identity") and a condition on time-ordered products that contain a factor of the free field W or the free stress-energy tensor T-ab. The main results of our paper are (1) a proof that in spacetime dimensions greater than 2, our new conditions can be consistently imposed in addition to our previously considered conditions and (2) a proof that, if they are imposed, then for any polynomial interaction Lagrangian L, (with no restriction on the number of derivatives appearing in L-1), the stress-energy tensor circle minus(ab) of the interacting theory will be conserved. Our work thereby establishes (in the context of perturbation theory) the conservation of stress-energy for an arbitrary interacting scalar field in curved spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. Our approach requires us to view time-ordered products as maps taking classical field expressions into the quantum field algebra rather than as maps taking Wick polynomials of the quantum field into the quantum field algebra.

AB  - Olfaction's unique cognitive architecture, the apparently inconsistent evidence favoring imagery, and its difficulty of evocation have led some to conclude that there is no capacity for olfactory imagery Using three streams of evidence, we examine the validity of this claim. First, self-reports of olfactory imagery can resemble those obtained for actual perception. Second, imagining an odor can produce effects similar to actual perception. Third, olfactory perception and memory-based images can interact. A model of olfactory imagery is then presented that utilizes the same systems employed in actual perception, with similar constraints. This model is consistent with olfaction's unique information-processing capacities and can account for previous experimental inconsistencies on the basis of difficulty of evocation, a consequence of unstable access to semantic information. In sum, the evidence presented here is favorable to the existence of an olfactory imagery capacity.

AB  - Mechanisms involved in paraquat neurotoxicity that selectively target nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons remain relatively unknown. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that paraquat exposure leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a process of redox cycling and that microglia represent an important site for the initiation of redox cycling reactions. Addition of paraquat to N9 microglial cultures resulted in a dose- and time-dependent release of superoxide radicals. Other agents that share with paraquat the property of redox cycling, i.e., benzyl viologen and diquat, also induced a marked production of superoxide radicals by microglia. The ability of paraquat, benzyl viologen, and diquat to induce superoxide release was correlated to their one-electron reduction potentials and thus their tendency to redox cycle. Nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase were identified as enzymatic sources of electrons that triggered paraquat redox cycling by microglia. Taken together, these data provide evidence in favor of a new mechanism by which microglia could play a role in oxidative injury during neurodegenerative processes. Microglial NOS and NADPH oxidase could promote the generation of ROS via the redox cycling of paraquat-like toxicants. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra zona compacta, and in other sub-cortical nuclei associated with a widespread occurrence of Lewy bodies. The cause of cell death in Parkinson's disease is still poorly understood, but a defect in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced oxidative and nitrative stresses have been proposed. We have studied control(wt) (C57B1/6), metallothionein transgenic (MTtrans), metallothionein double gene knock (MTdko), alpha-synuclein knock out (alpha-syn(ko)), alpha-synuclein-metallothionein triple knock out (alpha-syn-MTtko), weaver mutant (wv/wv) mice, and Ames dwarf mice to examine the role of peroxynitrite in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and aging. Although MTdko mice were genetically susceptible to 1, methyl, 4-phenyl, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) Parkinsonism, they did not exhibit any overt clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration and gross neuropathological changes as observed in wv/wv mice. Progressive neurodegenerative changes were associated with typical Parkinsonism in wv/wv mice. Neurodegenerative changes in wv/wv mice were observed primarily in the striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Various hallmarks of apoptosis including caspase-3, TNF alpha, NF kappa B, metallothioneins (MT-1, 2) and complex-1 nitration were increased; whereas glutathione, complex-1, ATP, and Ser(40)-phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, and striatal F-18-DOPA uptake were reduced in wv/wv mice as compared to other experimental genotypes. Striatal neurons of wv/wv mice exhibited age-dependent increase in fibs, c-jun, caspase-3, and GAPDH) induction, interdense cored intra-neuronal inclusions, cellular aggregation, proto-oncogenes (c-fos, c-jun,caspase-3, and GAPDH) introduction, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and neuro-apoptosis. MTtrans and alpha-Syn(ko) mice were genetically resistant to MPTP-Parkinsonism and Ames dwarf mice possessed significantly higher concentrations of striatal coenzyme Q(10) and metallothioneins (MT 1, 2) and lived almost 2.5 times longer as compared to control(wt) mice. A potent peroxynitrite ion generator, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1)-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated in MTtrans fetal stem cells. These data are interpreted to suggest that peroxynitrite ions are involved in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, and metallothionein-mediated coenzyme Q(10) synthesis may provide neuroprotection.

AB  - The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is presently unknown. The unifying hallmark of disease is depletion of dopamine and loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Familial and sporadic forms of the disease are described. The familial mutations occur within alpha-synuclein and molecules involved in protein degradation and mitochondrial function. Sporadic PD is thought to involve the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Despite disparate initiating triggers, a convergent pathobiologic model for this common neurodegenerative disease has been proposed. Likely players have emerged that may form the basis for this common pathway model of disease. In this review, we examine the role of three most implicated PD pathogenic conspirators: synuclein, dopamine and oxidative stress. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lavender essential oil: a review
AB  - Lavender essential oil is popular as a complementary medicine in its own right and as an additive to many over the counter complementary medicine and cosmetic products)(1,3). Indeed, products derived from the popular garden herb Lavender (Lavandula spp.) have been used for centuries as a therapeutic agent, with the more 'recent' addition, the essential oils derived from these plants, being widely used as an antibacterial in World War I-2,I-4. The oil is traditionally believed to have sedative, carminative, anti-depressive and anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to its recognised antimicrobial effects.
   Many of the activities attributed to lavender oil have not, however, been substantiated in the scientific literature. This is further complicated by the fact that the majority of research into lavender essential oils has been based on oil derived from English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), with little or no differentiation being made between this and other lavender essential oils. The therapeutic potential of essential oils produced from other varieties, such as L. x intermedia (lavandin), L. stoechas (French lavender) and L. x allardii, have largely been ignored. Although the ethnobotanical uses and major chemical constituents are similar between various la venders, some differences do occur in both oil composition and in the reported therapeutic uses for different species(3,5). The significant scientific interest in recent years into the validity/veracity of the traditional beliefs surrounding lavender oil and their scientific basis, if any, was recently reviewed by Cavanagh & Wilkinson(3). In this paper we provide an overview of the use of lavender oil in infectious disease and an update on recent research on alternative uses of lavender oil.

   Results Of 409 studies found, we were able to acquire 300 for further inspection. They all involved particularly violent people (total n=28 669), mostly adult men; the mean study size was 197 (median 52, mode 60, range 1-1200). In these 300 randomised trials over 700 interventions were evaluated and short-term outcomes were recorded on 345 different scales.
   Conclusions Wider collaboration, rationalising treatments and simplifying outcomes could further strengthen the tradition of trialling in forensic psychiatry Systematic reviews of these studies are overdue.

AB  - Rates of patient-initiated premature termination in different forms of psychotherapy are consistently high. Patient-initiated premature termination is recognized as a significant obstacle to the effective and efficient use of psychotherapy. The literature describes many strategies for preventing premature termination, but lacks integration. This review attempts to provide a concise and comprehensive summary of the strategies that research or clinical experience have suggested may be useful for minimizing patient-initiated premature termination. A search was conducted on the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases for literature published between January 1970 and March 2004. Retrieved articles were published in English in peer-reviewed journals and focused on psychotherapy for adults. Thirty-nine publications that discussed strategies for preventing or reducing patient-initiated premature termination of psychotherapy were identified. Surprisingly, only 15 of these were research studies. Most of the retrieved literature consisted of clinical descriptions. The strategies can be assigned to nine categories: pretherapy preparation, patient selection, time-limited or short-term contracts, treatment negotiation, case management, appointment reminders, motivation enhancement, facilitation of a therapeutic alliance, and facilitation of affect expression. Research supports some of the strategies for reducing premature termination. However, methodologically sound studies of prevention strategies remain few in number.

AB  - Objective: Insomnia in people with HIV and AIDS has been widely but inconsistently reported. We present the results of a systematic review of the subject. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCHLIT, and CINAHL databases were searched, and inclusion criteria were applied. The study results were then collated and described. Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified, and there was wide variation in both method and quality. Insomnia was reported frequently and at all stages of HIV infection. Early reports of sleep-specific electroencephalographic changes were not confirmed. The role of immune dysregulation, virus progression, and adverse drug effects in contributing to insomnia is unclear. The presence of cognitive impairment, an AIDS-defining illness, and treatment with efavirenz were found to be significant risk factors, but the most notable association was with psychologic morbidity. There was limited evidence for the effect of specific treatments for insomnia in HIV infection. Conclusions: This review found that psychologic morbidity was a major determinant of insomnia in HIV infection. Further study would be of value in clarifying the role of other factors, as well as measuring the impact of insomnia on functioning and quality of life in this population.

AB  - Due process requires courts to make decisions based on the evidence before them without regard to information outside of the record. Skepticism about the ability of jurors to ignore inadmissible information is widespread. Empirical research confirms that this skepticism is well-founded. Many courts and commentators, however, assume that judges can accomplish what jurors cannot. This Article reports the results of experiments we have conducted to determine whether judges can ignore inadmissible information. We found that the judges who participated in our experiments struggled to perform this challenging mental task. The judges had difficulty disregarding demands disclosed during a settlement conference, conversation protected by the attorney-client privilege, prior sexual history of an alleged rape victim, prior criminal convictions of a plaintiff, and information the government had promised not to rely upon at sentencing. This information influenced judges' decisions even when they were reminded, or themselves had ruled, that the information was inadmissible. In contrast, the judges were able to ignore inadmissible information obtained in violation of a criminal defendant's right to counsel and the outcome of a search when determining whether probable cause existed. We conclude that judges are generally unable to avoid being influenced by relevant but inadmissible information of which they are aware. Nevertheless, judges displayed a surprising ability to do so in some situations.

AB  - The field of styles presents three major controversial issues: styles as value-laden versus value-free, styles as traits versus states, and styles as different constructs versus similar constructs with different labels. We address these issues by proposing an integrative model of styles-the Threefold Model of Intellectual Styles-which divides all styles into three basic kinds. The foundation of this model is Sternberg and Zhang's body of empirical investigations into the thinking styles proposed in the theory of mental self-government. The model also draws upon others' previous empirical findings in the literature. The model argues that most styles are value-laden rather than value-free; that they have both trait-like and state-like aspects, but for the most part are modifiable and hence more state-like; and that they overlap highly across theories.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to summarise the reported excess in coronary events on Mondays, and examine the evidence for three competing explanations: stress, alcohol consumption, or registration errors. A review of the literature found 28 studies covering 16 countries and over 1.6 million coronary events. The overall Monday excess was small; in a population experiencing 100 coronary events per week there was one more event on Monday than other days. The excess was larger in men and in studies including sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrests. In a prospective study an increase in events on Mondays was associated with greater alcohol consumption, lower rainfall, and the month of January. The excess in coronary events on Mondays is a persistent phenomenon. The size of the effect varies widely between populations. There is some evidence of an association with alcohol consumption, but a definitive explanation remains elusive and is likely to remain so because of the smallness of the effect and the paucity of high quality data.

KW  - SELF
AB  - Objective: Societies and cultures have been described as being individualistic or collectivist (also called ego-centric or socio-centric). Similarly individuals are idiocentric or allocentric.
   Method: Using migration, migrants, ethnic minorities, collectivism and individualism, four databases of Embase, Medline, PsychInfo and Social Sciences abstracts were searched. Other key words included mental disorder, mental distress, psychiatric and psychological disorders. In addition, hand searches were conducted from the relevant books, monographs and secondary references.
   Results: Migration, cultural identity and mental distress are linked. In addition, social support can provide a buffer against mental illness. Other vulnerability factors in migrants include the type of society they originate from and the type of society they settle in.
   Conclusion: When individuals migrate from one type of culture to another it is likely that depending upon their own personality traits (along with their biopsycho-social vulnerabilities) may develop psychiatric disorders. The cognitions and idioms of distress will be influenced by cultural factors. The clinicians must take into account cultural background when planning any interventions to enable a stronger therapeutic alliance.

AB  - Although recent U. S. Supreme Court decisions regarding the death penalty (e. g., Atkins v. Virginia, 2002) have renewed interest in mental health issues, one topic that has not received much attention recently is the ongoing use of expert testimony to support claims that defendants represent a "continuing threat to society." In this article, we (a) review prior research relevant to determining the accuracy of clinical predictions that capital defendants will commit future acts of criminal violence; (b) summarize new data from current and former death row inmates in Texas that bolster the claim that such predictions are gross overestimates of risk; and (c) review extant research addressing the potential utility of various risk assessment instruments that increasingly are being used to reinforce clinical predictions in capital trials. Despite significant recent advances in the field of risk assessment, clinical assertions that a defendant is likely to commit future violent acts appear to be highly inaccurate and ethically questionable at best. Moreover, available research offers little support for the claim that the accuracy of these predictions will be appreciably improved by relying on more structured risk assessment measures that have some demonstrated predictive validity in other contexts.

AB  - Objectives: To provide a chronologic review of growing knowledge in occupational medicine relating work and work hazards to health, and to provide a perspective on the lessions learned from the frequent inattention or misrepresentation of hazards. Methods: Many books on the social and medical history of work including epidemiology and toxicology were reviewed as well as published papers and interviews. Results: Throughout history workplace hazards and occupational medicine have been shaped by the forces that shape work itself, social evolution, changing modes of production, shifting economic powers, and demographic changes in the workforce. Lest we think these changes are unique to the present time, this paper emphasizes the long-term and inevitable relationship between social structure and worker health Hippocrates emphasized the relation between environment (air and water) and health, although he has less to say about the non-military work environment, perhaps because of the denigration of manual labor in Greece. The impact of work on health can be traced to the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, written approximately 1700 BC The earliest occupational physicians served military forces, and Galen was physician to Roman gladiators. Finger and wrist guards worn by Bronze Age archers represent early personal protective equipment. Writers of the classic period mention diseases and hazards of miners, and Pliny (1st century AD) mentions veils to cover the face. In the Middle East Rhazes included occupation in his case studies (9th century). Paracelsus, and Agricola were prominent, figures in the 15th century, with an emphasis on mining and health Ramazzini's (c1700) work was widely translated in ensuing decades and is now well-known to all, but its influence between about 1800 and 1940 is inapparent The emergence of a public health movement in the mid-1800s focused attention on the abominable conditions of many factories and on the living conditions, poor nutrition, high stress, poverty and ill health of the new factory working class, while paying scant attention to specific workplace hazards. Conclusions: The recognition of occupational diseases in the United States has often lagged by a generation behind the recognition of the same diseases in Europe We are now into a second industrial revolution Led by multinational corporations and information technology, shifting production facilities, and jobs moving around the world in search of cheap labor in the countries with the fastest growing population and the greatest poverty. Occupational medicine must be alert to the new challenges imposed by this revolution.

AB  - Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a strong predictor of suicide in schizophrenia. The aim of this review was to identify risk factors for DSH in schizophrenia. This systematic review of the international literature examined cohort and case-control studies of patients with schizophrenia or related diagnoses that reported DSH as an outcome. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases and reference lists, and by consulting international experts. Fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Of the 29 variables examined by two or more studies, five (past or recent suicidal ideation, previous DSH, past depressive episode, drug abuse or dependence, and higher mean number of psychiatric admissions) were associated with an increased risk of DSH, and one (unemployment) was associated with a reduced risk. Schizophrenic patients with these risk factors need careful follow-up and monitoring, with treatment of any associated comorbid depression or drug abuse. Large, prospective studies of DSH in schizophrenia are needed to further define risk factors and to build on the findings of this review.

AB  - Objective: To present a functional model of depression facilitating research and clinical understanding.
   Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature search and reviewed articles pertaining to the neurochemistry and pathophysiology of depressive disorders, focusing on the contribution made by the principal monoamines to three differing depressive structural sub-types (i.e. psychotic, melancholic and non-melancholic).
   Results: We suggest that the three structural depressive subtypes appear functionally underpinned by differential contributions of serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitters, so influencing phenotypic distinction (our structural model) and allowing an aetiological model to be derived with treatment specificity implications.
   Conclusion: The functional model logically iterates with the structural model of depression and provides a useful framework for conceptualizing the depressive disorders. This model provides a logic for distinguishing between principal depressive subtypes, pursuing their functional underpinnings and explaining treatment differential effects across the three sub-types.

AB  - Objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinically heterogeneous condition. This heterogeneity can reduce the power and obscure the findings from natural history studies to genome scans, neuroimaging, and clinical trials. The authors review the evidence supporting a multidimensional model of OCD.
   Method: Computerized and manual literature searches were performed to identify factor-analytic studies of obsessive-compulsive symptoms before data from disciplines that bear on the potential usefulness of these dimensions were considered. Selection criteria included the novelty and importance of studies and their relevance to outcomes of interest to well-informed mental health professionals.
   Results: Twelve factor-analytic studies involving more than 2,000 patients were identified that consistently extracted at least four symptom dimensions: symmetry/ ordering, hoarding, contamination/ cleaning, and obsessions/ checking. These dimensions were associated with distinct patterns of comorbidity, genetic transmission, neural substrates, and treatment response. The evidence supporting the hoarding dimension is particularly robust.
   Conclusions: The complex clinical presentation of OCD can be summarized with a few consistent, temporally stable symptom dimensions. These can be understood as a spectrum of potentially overlapping syndromes that may 1) coexist in any patient, 2) be continuous with normal obsessive-compulsive phenomena, and 3) extend beyond the traditional nosological boundaries of OCD. Although the dimensional structure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms is imperfect, this quantitative approach to phenotypic traits has the potential to advance our understanding of OCD and may aid in the identification of more robust endophenotypes. The need for a dimensional rating scale and suggestions for future research aimed at reducing the burden of this disorder are discussed.

AB  - Recent evidence has indicated that some children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) show reduced ability to detect visual motion. The data suggest that this impairment is present in children with a range of autistic spectrum diagnoses, but not present in all children diagnosed with ASD. The occurrence of abnormal motion perception in children with ASD has led to speculation regarding the root of this impairment. Hypotheses regarding reduced sensitivity of the visual magnocellular system/cortical dorsal stream (Milne et al., 2002; Spencer et al., 2000) and reduced neuronal integration (Bertone et al., 2003), will be discussed. in this review. Clinical implications of the impairment, such as the degree to which motion perception may be related to diagnostic criteria and/or symptom severity in ASD, and the relationship between abnormal motion perception in autistic spectrum, and other, non-autistic spectrum developmental disorders will also be discussed. The conclusion is drawn that more research should be carried out including larger samples of participants, and that in future studies researchers should provide details of the variability of performance in their data, and investigate relationships between motion perception, diagnostic criteria, symptom severity and other potential correlates which, it is hoped will lead to further understanding of the implications of abnormal motion perception in ASD.

AB  - We employed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression to identify transcriptional changes in a cellular model of Parkinson Disease (PD). The model consisted of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells compared before and after 8 hours' exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine. Approximately 1200 transcripts were significantly induced by 6-ORDA and approximately 500 of these are currently matched to known genes. Here, we categorize the regulated genes according to known functional activities and discuss their potential roles in neuron death and survival and in PD. We find induction of multiple death-associated genes as well as many with the capacity for neuroprotection. This suggests that survival or death of individual neurons in PD may reflect an integrated response to both protective and destructive gene changes. Our findings identify a number of regulated genes as candidates for involvement in PD and therefore as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Such intervention may include both inhibiting the induction/activity, of death-promoting genes and enhancing those with neuroprotective activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arterial spin labeling perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive method of obtaining time-series measurements; of regional cerebral perfusion. Magnetically tagged protons in arterial water are labeled and allowed to perfuse the cerebral tissue. The perfusion-fMRI data are then generated from measurements of the difference between sequentially obtained label images and control images. This differencing step bestows signal properties upon perfusion data that are quite different from those of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Unlike with BOLD, the resulting time-series data are quantifiable and stable over long time scales. As a consequence, perfusion fMRI is well suited to the stud), of mental operations and neural changes that evolve slowly, over a period of hours to days. The technique is currently limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and slow image acquisition. Ways to improve both of these weaknesses are available, including scanning at higher field strength, using surface coils, and using optimized three-dimensional image acquisition.

AB  - The main purpose of this article is to provide a guide to theorems on global properties of solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system. This system couples Einstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an important field of research during several decades in which the main focus has been on nonrelativistic and special relativistic physics, i.e. to model the dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas, and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In 1990, Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov system. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this system have been established. The Vlasov equation describes matter phenomenologically, and it should be stressed that most of the theorems presented in this article are not presently known for other such matter models (i.e. fluid models). This paper gives introductions to kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is introduced. We believe that a good understanding of kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes is fundamental to good comprehension of kinetic theory in general relativity.

In part, these contributions have been fostered by major changes in law over this period; in part, they have been spurred by findings from large-scale Canadian prediction-outcome studies. This paper offers references for a range of Canadian-inspired assessment schemes designed to evaluate psychopathy and potential for violence against others.

AB  - A dynamic model for assessing the transfer of several radionuclides (Co-58, Co-60, Ag-110m, Cs-134, Cs-137, Mn-54 and I-131) in a food-chain was applied on the Loire river, where 14 nuclear power plants situated on five different sites operate. The model considers the following potential exposure pathways: (i) transfer of radionuclides through the aquatic food chain and the subsequent internal exposure of humans due to ingestion of contaminated water and/or fish; (ii) use of river water for agricultural purposes (irrigation), transfer of radionuclides through the terrestrial food chain and the subsequent internal exposure of humans due to ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs; (iii) internal exposure due to inhalation of dust originating from resuspension of contaminated soil particles; (iv) external exposure from radionuclides present in the river or deposited on the river sediments or the soil. For each of the parameters introduced in this model, a probability density function, allowing further uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, was proposed. Uncertainty/sensitivity analysis were performed to: (i) compare calculations to empirical data; (ii) determine a confidence interval for the mean annual dose to critical groups; and (iii) identify the parameters responsible for the uncertainty and subsequent research priorities.

AB  - Reaching a correct differential diagnosis among patients with psychotic symptoms was especially important during the era of first-generation antipsychotics, when treatments for the different disorders varied in terms of adverse events and likelihood of response. The historical "overdiagnosis" of schizophrenia and "underdiagnosis" of bipolar disorder in the United States was blamed for an increased exposure to neuroleptics among patients who might have benefited from lithium. With the recognition that second-generation antipsychotics are useful in the treatment of both schizophrenia and bipolar mania, and that combining them with classic mood stabilizers such as valproate may result in increased efficacy, the field is witnessing a convergence of pharmacological approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Substantially more data is available regarding combination treatments for bipolar disorder than for schizophrenia, and appropriate diagnosis remains important in predicting prognosis, but until the precise pathophysiology of psychotic disorders can be elucidated, and specific targeted treatments crafted, we will continue to see similar blended treatments for these two disease states.

AB  - The development of a cDNA array of coral genes and its application to investigate changes in coral gene expression associated with stressful conditions is described. The array includes both well-characterized and previously unidentified coral genes from Acropora cervicornis and Montastraea faveolata. Corals were exposed to either natural or anthropogenic stressors to elicit the expression of stress genes for isolation and incorporation onto the array. A total of 32 genes involved in protein synthesis, apoptosis, cell signaling, metabolism, cellular defense and inflammation were included on the array. Labeled cDNA from coral (Montastraea faveolata) exposed to elevated seawater temperature, salinity and ultraviolet light was tested against the microarray to determine patterns of gene expression associated with each stressor. Carbonic anhydrase, thioredoxin, a urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (OAR) and three ribosomal genes demonstrated differential expression across all replicates on the array and between replicate colonies. Specific gene expression patterns produced in response to different stressors demonstrate the potential for gene expression profiling in characterizing the coral stress response.

AB  - This review deals with the history and the present "State of the Art" of the concept of the basic symptoms (BS), constituting the pre- and postpsychotic basic stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and the significance of the BS for therapy, primary and secondary prevention of the schizophrenic psychosis and for rehabilitation, for searching into onset, course and outcome as well as etiology and theory of schizophrenia. Already MAYER-GROSS' classical description of schizophrenia [133] anticipated some aspects of the BSC, which has been gradually developed since the early 50s. It is shown, that the BS are experiential and not behavioural in kind as the "Prodromal and Residual Symptoms" (PRS) of DSM. BS are as a rule recognizable only through the self-reports of the patients, who are able to develop self-help and coping strategies, what is in comparable manner not possible for the patients with true negative symptoms (NS). The BS can be assessed by a standardized survey, the Bonn Schedule for the Assessment of BS (BSABS) [36,45]. The prepsychotic precursor syndromes precede the first psychotic episode as prodromes for 3-5 years and as outpost syndromes for 10 years on average. Certain first rank symptoms of schizophrenia develop from certain transition-relevant cognitive BS, that are early warning signals and predictors of the schizophrenic psychoses. Except of "primary negative anosognosia schizophrenias" (11%), the schizophrenia is beginning with BS, followed by positive psychotic symptoms and NS. The Bonn-Cologne prospective early recognition study has shown that many seemingly neurotic or psychopathic conditions, today diagnosed e.g. as anxiety, somatoform or personality disorders or dysthymia, are prepsychotic or also postpsychotic basic stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ICD-10 F20, F22-25). The review outlines consequences of the findings of the true onset of the disease for better understanding of the patients and the primary and secondary prevention of the schizophrenic psychosis. Early somatic therapy improves the long-term prognosis; the longer prodromes persist untreated, the more rarely are full or far-reaching psychopathological remissions.

AB  - This review provides a historical perspective on a model for schizophrenia based on results of experiments derived from learning theory. It was developed by the author in collaboration with Jeffrey Gray and numerous colleagues, (e.g. [Gray, J.A., MeNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety. second ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hemsley, D.R., 1987a An experimental psychological model for schizophrenia. In: Hafner, H., Gattaz, W.F., Janzarik, W. (Eds.), Search for the Causes of Schizophrenia, vol. 1. Springer, New York, pp. 179-188.; Hemsley, D.R., 1993. A simple (or simplistic?) cognitive model for schizophrenia. Behaviour Research and Therapy 31, 633-646]. It contrasts with earlier cognitive formulations [e.g. Hemsley, D.R., 1975. A two stage model of attention in schizophrenia research. British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 14, 81-88], which emphasised a weakening of contextually elicited response biases, and lacked a link to potential neural bases of the disorder. The model emphasizes the need to demonstrate patterns of performance that are not interpretable in terms of the well established 'generalized deficit' manifest in schizophrenia. It proposes that the cognitive disturbance is a change in the way stored material is integrated with sensory input and ongoing motor programmes. In particular, spatial and temporal context fail to activate appropriate stored regularities. A number of possible pathways from the cognitive disturbance to the symptoms of schizophrenia are outlined; again the term 'context' is widely employed. Thus, it has been invoked to explain the occurrence of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder and disruptions in the sense of personal identity. However the term 'context' is ill-defined and the review indicates the variety of ways in which it may exert its influence. These are unlikely to reflect the operation of a unitary mechanism.

AB  - Objective: Whilst database use for the purposes of audit is well established amongst clinicians, their research potential has yet to be fully realised. This review provides an international perspective on research using databases in psychiatry, considering the advantages and constraints of their use.
   Method: Large databases used in psychiatric research were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The types of research conducted with these databases were then grouped into categories for discussion. A narrative synthesis of results is presented. illustrated with examples.
   Results: Research identified included pharmacoepidemiology, perinatal, aetiological, suicidology and health service research.
   Conclusions: Databases have been used to address a range of questions ill psychiatry, often by employing linkage between clinical and national administrative databases. The success of such research is not only dependent oil appropriate methodology and database design, but also on clinician commitment to data entry. Further exploitation of linkage potential between databases is envisaged, alongside international development of clinical databases designed with the purpose of research in mind.

TI  - The American Indian Church and its sacramental use of peyote: A review for professionals in the mental-health arena
AB  - Psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, counselors, and other people involved in the mental-health fields are increasingly working with American Indians who practice various religious ceremonies and life ways foreign to Western-oriented epistemologies and ontologies. The American Indian Church and its sacramental use of peyote is one such example. This paper provides a brief history of the American Indian Church and its use of peyote, as well as the American Indian beliefs behind the use of peyote and the psychopharmacological data concerning peyote. It is shown that the sacramental use of peyote by the American Indian Church members is not a deviant hallucinogenic disorder and that in fact it provides a means of achieving and maintaining health, balance, respect, and a sense of community among participants and their social relations.

AB  - The recent discovery of contamination of the tropical marine environment by Photosystem 11 (PSII) herbicides used in agriculture and antifouling paints has led to concerns regarding the effects on corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellate algae. In reviewing the ecotoxicological studies conducted so far, PSII herbicides appear able to readily penetrate the coral tissues and rapidly (within minutes) reduce the photochemical efficiency of the intracellular algal symbionts. The dinoflagellates appear at least as sensitive to PSII herbicides as other phototrophs tested so far, with photosynthesis being affected at exceptionally low concentrations (i.e. in the ng l(-1) range). At these levels and over short exposure periods, the effects can be fully reversible (i.e. when corals are returned to clean seawater) and vary according to type of herbicide; however, when exposed to higher concentrations in the light or over longer exposure periods, it results in a long-term sustained reduction of the photochemical efficiency of the algae (symptomatic of chronic photoinhibition). This can result in the dissociation of the symbiosis (bleaching) which is a common but nevertheless significant sub lethal stress response requiring many months to recover from. It is argued that the reliance of corals on an endosymbiotic photo-autotrophic energy source, together with predilection for the symbiosis to dissociate when photosynthesis of the algae is affected, renders coral particularly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions-and especially phytotoxins such as PSII herbicides.

AB  - Rodent models of ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety have been used to explore the neurobiology underlying withdrawal and to evaluate the utility of therapeutic agents aimed at reducing withdrawal severity. Of the many tests of anxiety-like behavior, the elevated plus maze, light/dark box, and open field are the most commonly used. In general, ethanol withdrawal decreases most or all of the individual behaviors recorded in these tasks, indicating the occurrence of an anxiogenic-like effect of withdrawal in rodents, although these effects of withdrawal have not always been found. Potential problems with interpreting the effects of withdrawal as being indicative of an anxiety-like state include the effects of withdrawal on motivation to explore an apparatus, non-specific effects of withdrawal on locomotion, and the use of test parameters that have not been pharmacologically validated. For example, most of the published studies interpreted as having shown increased anxiety-like behavior during ethanol withdrawal have also observed concurrent decreases in locomotion. At a minimum, a given test of anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal should be responsive to the dose and duration of ethanol exposure that was used to produce physical dependence, and should not non-specifically decrease locomotion. In addition, standard anxiolytic drugs should ameliorate the anxiogenic-like effects of withdrawal, preferably in multiple tests of anxiety-like behavior. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reviews the current state of bedside behavioral assessment in brain-damaged patients with impaired consciousness (coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state). As misdiagnosis in this field is unfortunately very frequent, we first discuss a number of fundamental principles of clinical evaluation that should guide the assessment of consciousness in brain-damaged patients in order to avoid confusion between vegetative state and minimally conscious state. The role of standardized behavioral assessment tools is particularly stressed. The second part of this paper reviews existing behavioral assessment techniques of consciousness, showing that there are actually a large number of these scales. After a discussion of the most widely used scale, the Glasgow Coma Scale, we present several new promising tools that show higher sensitivity and reliability for detecting subtle signs of recovery of consciousness in the post-acute setting.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Although the etiology of PD is incompletely understood, the recent discovery of genes associated with rare monogenic forms of the disease, together with earlier studies and new experimental animal models, has provided important and novel insight into the molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Increasing evidence indicates that deficits in mitochondrial function, oxidative and nitrosative stress, the accumulation of aberrant or misfolded proteins, and ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction may represent the principal molecular pathways or events that commonly underlie the pathogenesis of sporadic and familial forms of PD.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on suicide of inpatients with schizophrenia, to identify suicide risk factors as well as typical patterns of behavior and to suggest a rationale and strategies for future interventions. Method: A computerized MedLine, Excerpta Medica and PsycLit search supplemented by an examination of cross-references and reviews. Results: Up to half the suicides among patients with schizophrenia occur during inpatient admission. Inpatient suicides were found among those of a young age group who were predominantly single, childless and socially isolated. The vast majority experienced an illness characterized by long duration and prolonged psychiatric hospitalizations or multiple admissions and discharges. Up to 50% of the suicides occurred in the first few weeks and months following discharge from the hospital. The paranoid subtype of schizophrenia, where positive symptoms prevail and negative symptoms are few, is associated with a suicide risk that is three times greater than that associated with nonparanoid subtypes and eight times greater than the risk associated with the deficit subtype. Conclusions: Treatment of suicide is a major problem among inpatients with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that suicide is generally carried-out by patients who have been recently discharged or by those who manage to get away from the hospital. Strategies aimed at preventing this phenomenon have been introduced to the medical personnel, but suicide in these patients does not seem to have been reduced. We emphasize the need to establish guidelines for the prevention of suicide in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia.

Moreover, alterations of antioxidative systems and beneficial effects of antioxidative substances including steroid compounds such as estrogens have been described in several of these diseases. This review focuses on alterations of antioxidative systems in the course of neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders and on the differential effects of steroids on these systems in the central nervous system. Moreover, a possible clinical relevance of alterations of circulating steroids and of steroid treatment under these conditions is discussed.

AB  - A search of the published literature identified 11 empirical studies that reported links between religion, spirituality, and posttraumatic growth. A review of these 11 studies produced three main findings. First, these studies show that religion and spirituality are usually, although not always, beneficial to people in dealing with the aftermath of trauma. Second, that traumatic experiences can lead to a deepening of religion or spirituality. Third, that positive religious coping, religious openness, readiness to face existential questions, religious participation, and intrinsic religiousness are typically associated with posttraumatic growth. Important directions for future research are suggested that centre on the need for more fine-grained analysis of religion and spirituality variables, together with longitudinal research designs, that allow more detailed exploration of the links between religion, spirituality, and posttraumatic growth.

AB  - The aim of this review was to survey the literature on depression in patients with myocardial infarction to assess the methodological quality and to test whether depression leads to an increased postmyocardial infarction mortality. Medline, Psycinfo, and www.UMI.com were searched, and researchers were contacted in the autumn of 2003. Thirty-one articles were reviewed. Only seven articles scored above a predefined level of 75% for acceptable quality. The articles lack description of non-responders, recall period for depressive symptoms, validation of applied instrument on target population, and sample size large enough to show differences between groups. The prevalence rates of depression ranged from 1.6 to 50%. In eight articles, a diagnostic test was applied, in the rest of the studies, questionnaires were used. The prevalence of depression was highest in those using patient-completed questionnaires. A significant positive association was shown between depression and postmyocardial infarction mortality in 15 studies, a non-significant association in 14, and in two articles, this was not reported. In articles with data collection starting after 1994, a non-significant relation tended to be reported. The studies were generally not of acceptable quality. They lacked sufficient power to show differences in stated end points between groups. Application of non-validated instruments caused large differences in prevalence rates of depression. Future studies should include a minimum of 1,000 patients, use a validated instrument, re-examine the patients, and describe participants and non-participants in detail. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

AB  - Thalamocortical (TC) neurons form only a small percentage of the synapses onto neurons of cortical layer 4, but the response properties of these cortical neurons are arguably dominated by thalamic input. This discrepancy is explained, in part, by studies showing that TC synapses are of high efficacy. However, TC synapses display activity-dependent depression. Because of this, in vitro measures of synaptic efficacy will not reflect the situation in vivo, where different neuronal populations have widely varying levels of "spontaneous" activity. Indeed, TC neurons of awake subjects generate high rates of spontaneous activity that would be expected, in a depressing synapse, to result in a chronic state of synaptic depression. Here, we review recent work in the somatosensory thalamocortical system of awake rabbits in which the relationship between TC spike timing and TC synaptic efficacy was examined during both thalamic "relay mode" (alert state) and "burst mode" (drowsy state). Two largely independent methodological approaches were used. First, we employed cross-correlation methods to examine the synaptic impact of single TC "barreloid" neurons on a single neuronal subtype in the topographically aligned layer 4 "barrel" - putative fast-spike inhibitory interneurons. We found that the initial spike of a TC burst, as well as isolated TC spikes with long preceding interspike intervals (ISIs) elicited postsynaptic action potentials far more effectively than did TC impulses with short ISIs. Our second approach took a broader view of the postsynaptic impact of TC impulses. In these experiments we examined spike-triggered extracellular field potentials and synaptic Currents (using current source-density analysis) generated through the depths of a cortical barrel column by the impulses of single topographically aligned TC neurons. We found that (a) closely neighboring TC neurons may elicit very different patterns of monosynaptic activation within layers 4 and 6 of the aligned column, (b) synaptic currents elicited by TC impulses with long preceding ISIs were greatly enhanced in both of these layers, and (c) the degree of this enhancement differed reliably among neighboring TC neurons but, for a given neuron, was very similar in layers 4 and 6. Thus, results generated by both methodological approaches are consistent with the presence of a chronic depression at the awake TC synapse that is relieved by long ISIs. Since long ISIs necessarily precede TC "bursts", our results are consistent with the notion that these events powerfully activate cortical circuits.

AB  - Long- and short-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission are known as synaptic plasticity. Phenomena such as long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) are two classical forms of synaptic plasticity that are expressed in several brain areas, including the striatum. Bi-directional changes in corticostriatal synaptic transmission, i.e. LTD and LTP, have been proposed to represent the cellular mechanisms underlying the physiological processes of motor learning and behavior. In parallel, other forms of synaptic plasticity induced by different experimental pathological conditions have been described in the striatum; these changes are presumed to represent the cellular processes underlying several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. A considerable number of receptor and post-receptor systems participate in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the striatum, where glutamate plays a primary role through its ionotropic and metabotropic receptors (mGluRs). These latter constitute a group of recently characterized molecules, which have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission by acting on cellular excitability, ionic conductances and neurotransmitter release. These receptors have also been involved in several neuronal pathophysiological processes. The role of mGluRs in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity has been recently deeply studied and characterized in the striatum, in both physiological and pathological conditions. These findings open new and interesting perspectives in the study of basal ganglia function, and introduce new possible pharmacological approaches for the treatment of neurological disorders in which mGluRs have been experimentally involved.

AB  - Objective: To compare and contrast the neuropsychological profile of the 3 phases of bipolar disorder (BD) to achieve a better definition of BD and to identify potential state and trait deficits.
   Methods: We conducted a search for English-language papers published in journals from 1965 onward, using the following terms in Medline and Embase: neuropsychology or neuropsychological and BD, depression, mania, and euthymia. We scrutinized suitable subheadings and retrieved familiar papers and literature.
   Results: We initially identified more than 100 articles and then excluded reviews and papers that did not directly administer neuropsychological tests. This left 27 papers, which we further examined and the findings of which we tabulated and discussed. Cognitive and executive functioning deficits were found, including set-shifting, verbal fluency, planning, attention, and memory.
   Conclusions: The neuropsychological deficits found in bipolar depression, mania or hypomania, and euthymia provide important insights into the pathophysiology of BD and may, in future studies, form the basis of clinically meaningful subtypes.

AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. It is also known for having a substantial behavioral morbidity, including autistic features. In humans, Fragile X Syndrome is almost always caused by inactivation of the X-linked FMR1 gene. A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57B1L/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field. Finally, a molecular examination of the fmr1-tm1Cgr mouse shows that, contrary to common belief, it is not a molecular null. Implications of this finding for interpretation of the phenotype are discussed.

AB  - Background: Prospective studies on physically healthy subjects have shown an association between depression and the subsequent development of coronary heart disease (CHD). The relative risk in meta-analytic aggregation is 1.64 (confidence interval [CI], 1.29-2.08) for any CHD event. However, the adverse impact of depression on CHD patients has not yet been the subject of a meta-analysis. Objective: To quantify the impact of depressive symptoms (eg, BDI, HADS) or depressive disorders (major depression) on cardiac or all-cause mortality. We analyzed the strength of the relationship, the time dependency, and the differences in studies using depressive symptoms or a clinical diagnosis as predictors of mortality. Method: English and German language databases (Medline, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX) from 1980 to 2003 were searched for prospective cohort studies. Sixty-two publications were identified. The inclusion criteria were met by 29 publications reporting on 20 studies. A random model was used to estimate the combined overall effect as crude odds ratios (OR) or adjusted hazard ratios (HR [adj]). Results: Depressive symptoms increase the risk of mortality in CHD patients. The risk of depressed patients dying in the 2 years after the initial assessment is two times higher than that of nondepressed patients (OR, 2.24; 1.37-3.60). This negative prognostic effect also remains in the long-term (OR, 1.78; 1.12-2.83) and after adjustment for other risk factors (HR [adj], 1.76; 1.27-2.43). The unfavorable impact of depressive disorders was reported for the most part in the form of crude odds ratios. Within the first 6 months, depressive disorders were found to have no significant effect on mortality (OR, 2.07; Cl, 0.82-5.26). However, after 2 years, the risk is more than two times higher for CHD patients with clinical depression (OR, 2.61; 1.53-4.47). Only three studies reported adjusted hazard ratios for clinical depression and supported the results of the bivariate models. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and clinical depression have an unfavorable impact on mortality in CHD patients. The results are limited by heterogeneity of the results in the primary studies. There is no clear evidence whether self-report or clinical interview is the more precise predictor. Nevertheless, depression has to be considered a relevant risk factor in patients with CHD.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that iron is involved in the mechanisms that underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Conditions such as neuroferritinopathy and Friedreich ataxia are associated with mutations in genes that encode proteins that are involved in iron metabolism, and as the brain ages, iron accumulates in regions that are affected by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. High concentrations of reactive iron can increase oxidative-stress induced neuronal vulnerability, and iron accumulation might increase the toxicity of environmental or endogenous toxins. By studying the accumulation and cellular distribution of iron during ageing, we should be able to increase our understanding of these neurodegenerative disorders and develop new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Since the discovery in the 1970s that dendritic abnormalities in cortical pyramidal neurons are the most consistent pathologic correlate of mental retardation, research has focused on how dendritic alterations are related to reduced intellectual ability. Due in part to obvious ethical problems and in part to the lack of fruitful methods to study neuronal circuitry in the human cortex, there is little data about the microanatomical contribution to mental retardation. The recent identification of the genetic bases of some mental retardation associated alterations, coupled with the technology to create transgenic animal models and the introduction of powerful sophisticated tools in the field of microanatomy, has led to a growth in the studies of the alterations of pyramidal cell morphology in these disorders. Studies of individuals with Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder leading to mental retardation, allow the analysis of the relationships between cognition, genotype and brain microanatomy. In Down syndrome the crucial question is to define the mechanisms by which an excess of normal gene products, in interaction with the environment, directs and constrains neural maturation, and how this abnormal development translates into cognition and behaviour. In the present article we discuss mainly Down syndrome-associated dendritic abnormalities and plasticity and the role of animal models in these studies. We believe that through the further development of such approaches, the study of the microanatomical substrates of mental retardation will contribute significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human brain disorders associated with mental retardation.

AB  - The supramammillary area of the hypothalamus, although small in size, can have profound modulatory effects on the hippocampal formation and related temporal cortex. It can control hippocampal plasticity and also has recently been shown to contain cells that determine the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (theta rhythm). We review here its organization and anatomical connections providing an atlas and a new nomenclature. We then review its functions particularly in relation to its links with the hippocampus. Much of its control of behaviour and its differential activation by specific classes of stimuli is consistent with a tight relationship with the hippocampus. However, its ascending connections involve not only caudal areas of the cortex with close links to the hippocampus but also reciprocal connections with more rostral areas such as the infralimbic and anterior cingulate cortices. These latter areas appear to be the most rostral part of a network that, via the medial septum. hippocampus and lateral septum, is topographically mapped into the hypothalamus. The supramammillary area is thus diffusely connected with areas that control emotion and cognition and receives more topographically specific return information from areas that control cognition while also receiving ascending information from brain stem areas involved in emotion. We suggest that it is a key part of a network that recursively transforms information to achieve integration of cognitive and emotional aspects of goal-directed behaviour. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Here we review a role of a basal ganglia-brainstem (BG-BS) system throughout the mesopontine tegmentum in the control of various types of behavioral expression. First the basal ganglia-brainstem system may contribute to an automatic control of movements, such as rhythmic limb movements and adjustment of postural muscle tone during locomotion, which occurs in conjunction with voluntary control processes. Second, the basal ganglia-brainstem system can be involved in the regulation of awake-sleep states. We further propose the possibility that the basal ganglia-brainstem system is responsible for the integration of volitionally-guided and emotionally-triggered expression of motor behaviors. It can be proposed that dysfunction of the basal ganglia-brainstem system together with that of cortico-basal ganglia loop underlies the pathogenesis of behavioral disturbances expressed in basal ganglia dysfunction.

AB  - The authors present a theory of stochastic interactive parallel processing with special emphasis on channel interactions and their relation to system capacity. The approach is based both on linear systems theory augmented with stochastic elements and decisional operators and on a metatheory of parallel channels' dependencies that incorporates standard independent and coactive parallel models as special cases. The metatheory is applied to OR and AND experimental paradigms, and the authors establish new theorems relating response time performance in these designs to earlier and novel issues. One notable outcome is the remarkable processing efficiency associated with linear parallel-channel systems that include mutually positive interactions. The results may offer insight into perceptual and cognitive configural-holistic processing systems.

AB  - During aging, the production of free radicals increases. This can result in damage to protein, the accumulation of which is characteristic of the aging process. This questions the efficacy of proteolytic systems. Among these systems, the proteasome and the adenosine triphosphate-ubiquitin-dependent pathway have been shown to play an important role in the elimination of abnormal proteins. There are two major steps in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: the conjugation of a polyubiquitin degradation signal to the substrate and the subsequent degradation of the tagged protein by the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is build-up from the 20S proteasome, which is a cylinder-shaped multimeric complex, and two additional 19S complexes. The 20S proteasome can also bind to US regulator and is then implicated in antigen presentation. These regulators confer a high adaptability on proteasome.
   With advancing age, predisposition to neurodegenerative diseases increases. These diseases are also characterized by protein aggregation. Several findings such as the presence of ubiquinated proteins, usually broken down by proteasomes, and genetic anomalies involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system (parkin, UCH-L1) suggest a link between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the genesis of these diseases.

AB  - Expression of many fundamental mammalian behaviors such as, for example, aggression, mating, foraging or social behaviors, depend on locomotor activity. A central dilemma in the functional neuroimaging of these behaviors has been the fact that conventional neuroimaging techniques generally rely on immobilization of the subject, which extinguishes all but the simplest activity. Ideally, imaging could occur in freely moving subjects, while presenting minimal interference with the subject's natural behavior. Here we provide an overview of several approaches that have been undertaken in the past to achieve this aim in both tethered and freely moving animals, as well as in nonrestrained human subjects. Applications of specific radiotracers to single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography are discussed in which brain activation is imaged after completion of the behavioral task and capture of the tracer. Potential applications to clinical neuropsychiatry are discussed, as well as challenges inherent to constraint-free functional neuroimaging. Future applications of these methods promise to increase our understanding of the neural circuits underlying mammalian behavior in health and disease. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Postoperative fatigue is common following major abdominal surgery. Less is known about its prevalence in other surgical subgroups, and about its long-term prognosis. A systematic review of prospective cohort studies was conducted to clarify these issues. Method: Studies were identified from an extensive literature search. Overall estimates of pre- to postoperative change in fatigue severity and the incidence of clinically significant postoperative fatigue were calculated using meta-analyses. Results: Eighty-one cohorts were identified. Type of surgery was found to be a possible predictor of fatigue severity, with major abdominal, gynaecological, cardiac and minor surgery apparently associated with greater fatigue than orthopaedic surgery. Limited data were available regarding the long-term persistence of postoperative fatigue. Conclusion: Postoperative fatigue appears to be an important problem following only certain forms of surgery. Why this is so remains unclear, and further work using better fatigue questionnaires is now required to confirm these differences. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC), also referred to as community treatment orders or assisted outpatient treatment, is a legal intervention intended to improve treatment adherence among persons with serious mental illness. This paper reviews the empirical literature on the procedure's effectiveness.
   Methods: We identified and reviewed all English-language studies of OPC and related procedures available in Medline and other bibliographic search services.
   Results: Existing naturalistic and quasi-experimental studies, taken as a whole, moderately support the view that the procedure is effective, although all do have methodological limitations. Two randomized controlled studies of OPC have conflicting findings and are reviewed in detail.
   Conclusions: On balance, empirical studies support the view that OPC is effective under certain conditions, although some of the evidence has been contested and the policy remains controversial.

AB  - Objective: Platelet hyperactivity is thought to contribute to the increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in depression. This study reviewed the evidence for hyperactive platelets and for effects of antidepressant drug treatment on platelet 'stickiness' in clinical depression.
   Method: By means of PubMed electronic library search, 34 studies in English were identified (1983-2003) and critically reviewed.
   Results: In depression, flow cytometry studies allowing detection of subtle platelet activation states consistently found at least one platelet activation marker to be increased, while the bulk of platelet aggregation studies did not suggest increased platelet aggregability. Platelets seem to be more activated in depressed patients with CAD than in depressed individuals without CAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors normalized platelet hyperactivity in four studies.
   Conclusion: Data on platelet activity in depression are inconclusive. To resolve this issue and its clinical implications, studies in larger sample sizes controlling for confounders of platelet functioning and prospectively designed are needed.

   Method: Medline was searched for articles meeting defined inclusion criteria. The following key terms were used: depressive disorders, antidepressive agents, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, child, and adolescent.
   Results: Six articles met inclusion criteria. Only 2 studies claim efficacy by significant results in primary outcomes; both have since been contested in further analysis. Not one study adequately examines safety, particularly with respect to whether a link exists between antidepressant use and induction of suicidal ideation or attempts.
   Conclusion: Published studies on SSRI or venlafaxine use in children and adolescents are inconclusive with respect to safety and efficacy, owing to inappropriate claims of efficacy, lack of improvement in global functioning scores, nonstandardized data collection regarding adverse effects, exclusion of suicidal subjects in the recruitment process, grouping of children and adolescents together, small sample sizes, conflict of interest posed by pharmaceutical company sponsorship, and publishing bias. Future investigators should consider these factors when developing study designs.

AB  - Objective: To critically review the literature to determine the current state of scientific knowledge concerning the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD) from a nonbiological perspective.
   Methods: Databases searched for this review include Medline, PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Embase, ProQuest, the Cochrane Library, and the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library. Studies selected were peer-reviewed English-language articles published between January 1, 1966, and December 31, 2003. Criteria used to evaluate the interventions were derived from the standardized methodology developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.
   Results: Twenty-nine studies that met criteria were examined. These included studies evaluating interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychological debriefing, antenatal classes, intrapartum support, supportive interactions, continuity of care, antenatal identification and notification, early postpartum follow-up, flexible postpartum care, educational strategies, and relaxation with guided imagery.
   Conclusions: While this review demonstrates that no specific approach can be strongly recommended for clinical practice, many explicit research implications have been highlighted. To further address PPD as a public health problem, it is critical to include ethnically and socioeconomically diverse women in research efforts examining the differences among depression symptoms, intervention response rates, and health service use.

AB  - Sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons and Lewy body inclusions. It is thought to result from a complex interaction between multiple predisposing genes and environmental influences, although these interactions are still poorly understood. Several causative genes have been identified in different families. Mutations in two genes [alpha-synuclein and nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1)] cause the same pathology, and a third locus on chromosome 2 also causes this pathology. Other familial PD mutations have identified genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system [parkin and ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase L1 (UCHL1)], although such cases do not produce Lewy bodies. These studies highlight critical cellular proteins and mechanisms for dopamine neuron survival as disrupted in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the genetic variations impacting on dopamine neurons may illuminate other molecular mechanisms involved. Additional candidate genes involved in dopamine cell survival, dopamine synthesis, metabolism and function, energy supply, oxidative stress, and cellular detoxification have been indicated by transgenic animal models and/or screened in human populations with differing results. Genetic variation in genes known to produce different patterns and types of neurodegeneration that may impact on the function of dopamine neurons are also reviewed. These studies suggest that environment and genetic background are likely to have a significant influence on susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. The identification of multiple genes predisposing to Parkinson's disease will assist in determining the cellular pathway/s leading to the neurodegeneration observed in this disease.

AB  - The catecholamine-oxidizing enzyme monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) has been hypothesized to be an important determining factor in the etiology of both normal aging and age-related neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Catalysis of substrate by the enzyme produces H2O2 which is a primary originator of oxidative stress which in turn can lead to cellular damage. MAO-B increases with age as does predisposition towards PD which has also been linked to increased oxidative stress. Inhibition of MAO-B, along with supplementation of lost dopamine via L-DOPA, is one of the major antiparkinsonian therapies currently in use. In this review, we address several factors contributing to a possible role for MAO-B in normal brain aging and neurological disease and also discuss the use of MAO-B inhibitors as drug therapy for these conditions.

Proponents have included many of the pioneers in the fields of learning disabilities and motor development. Among the challenges perhaps the most sophisticated one has been the meta-analysis by Kavale and Mattson. Their conclusion was that perceptual motor training was not an effective intervention for children with disabilities. The purpose of this project was to analyze critically the Kavale and Mattson meta-analysis from the perspective of an adapted physical educator and to consider the validity of this meta-analysis when examining multiple interventions dealing with a multitude of disabilities.

AB  - Many physiologists believe that hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) provide a remarkable, and possibly unique, example of 'natural freeze-tolerance' in an amniotic vertebrate. However, the concept of natural freeze-tolerance in neonatal painted turtles is based on results from laboratory studies that were not placed in an appropriate ecological context, so the concept is suspect. Indeed, the weight of current evidence indicates that hatchlings overwintering in the field typically withstand exposure to ice and cold by avoiding freezing altogether and that they do so without benefit of an antifreeze to depress the equilibrium freezing point for bodily fluids. As autumn turns to winter, turtles remove active nucleating agents from bodily fluids (including bladder and gut), and their integument becomes a highly efficient barrier to the penetration of ice into body compartments from frozen soil. In the absence of a nucleating agent or a crystal of ice to 'catalyze' the transformation of water from liquid to solid, the bodily fluids remain in a supercooled, liquid state. The supercooled animals nonetheless face physiological challenges, most notably an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism as the circulatory system first is inhibited and then caused to shut down by declining temperature. Alterations in acid/base status resulting from the accumulation of lactic acid may limit survival by supercooled turtles, and sublethal accumulations of lactate may affect behavior of turtles after the ground thaws in the spring. The interactions among temperature, circulatory function, metabolism (both aerobic and anaerobic), acid/base balance and behavior are fertile areas for future research on hatchlings of this model species.

AB  - This article reviews the current status of gambling epidemiology studies and suggests that it is time to move from general population-prevalence research toward the investigation of risk and protective factors that influence the onset of gambling disorders. The study of incidence among vulnerable and resilient populations is a road yet to be taken. In this review, we briefly introduce the history of the field and thoroughly review the epidemiologic research on disordered gambling before providing a critical assessment of the current diagnostic tools. Overall, the extant research shows that disordered gambling is a relatively stable phenomenon throughout the world. Given that certain segments of the population (for example, adolescents and substance users) have elevated prevalence rates, we suggest focusing future prevalence studies on groups with apparently increased vulnerability. Moreover, we suggest that, for the field of gambling studies to progress, researchers need to take the road less travelled and examine more carefully the onset and determinants of disordered gambling. That said, given the problems with the current diagnostic screens, investigators need to refine their theoretical concepts and the epidemiologic tools used to examine them before the field can travel down this new road.

AB  - Brain function is supported by central activating processes that are significant during waking, decrease during slow wave sleep following waking and increase again during paradoxical sleep during which brain activation is as high as, or higher than, during waking in nearly all structures. However, inhibitory mechanisms are crucial for sleep onset. They were first identified by behavioral, neuroanatomical and electrophysiological criteria, then by pharmacological and neurochemical ones. During slow wave sleep, they are supported by GABAergic mechanisms located at midbrain, mesopontine and pontine levels but are induced and sustained by forebrain and hindbrain influences. GABAergic processes are also responsible for paradoxical sleep occurrence, particularly by suppression of noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT) inhibition of paradoxical sleep-generating structures. Hindbrain and forebrain modulate these structures situated at the mesopontine level. For sleep mentation, the noradrenergic and serotonergic silence is thought, today, to be directly, or indirectly, responsible for dopamine predominance and glutamate decrease in the nucleus accumbens, which could be the background of the well-known psychotic-like mental activity of dreaming.

Their purpose is to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence relating to maintenance treatment. The data used for these guidelines were extracted from a MEDLINE and EMBASE search, from recent proceedings from key conferences and various national and international treatment guidelines. The scientific justification of support for particular treatments was categorised into four levels of evidence (A-D). As these guidelines are intended for clinical use, the scientific evidence was not only graded, but also reviewed by the experts of the task force to ensure practicality.

AB  - A dynamical system is canonically associated to every Drinfeld double of any affine Kac-Moody group. In particular, the choice of the affine Lu-Weinstein double gives a smooth one-parameter deformation of the standard WZW model. The deformed WZW model is exactly solvable and it admits the chiral decomposition. Its classical action is not invariant with respect to the left and right action of the loop group, however, it satisfies the weaker condition of the Poisson-Lie symmetry. The structure of the deformed WZW theory is characterized by several ordinary and dynamical r-matrices with spectral parameter. They describe the q-deformed current algebras, appear in the definition of q-primary fields and characterize the quasitriangular exchange (braiding) relations. The symplectic structure of the deformed chiral WZW theory is cocharacterized by the same elliptic dynamical r-matrix that appears in the Bernard generalization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, with q entering the modular parameter of the Jacobi theta functions. This reveals a remarkable connection between the classical q-deformed WZW model and the quantum standard WZW theory on elliptic curves.

   Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials comparing antidepressant treatment alone with antidepressant treatment in combination with a psychological intervention in depressive disorders were considered. The decision to include studies in the meta-analysis was performed by 2 reviewers.
   Data Extraction: Three independent reviewers extracted the data, using a precoded form. Methodological quality of the studies was evaluated in terms of allocation concealment and independence of evaluators.
   Data Synthesis: Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria, with 932 patients randomized to pharmacotherapy alone and 910 to combined treatment. Overall, patients receiving combined treatment improved significantly compared with those receiving drug treatment alone (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.52), but dropouts and nonresponders did not differ in distribution between the 2 treatment modalities (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.24). Studies longer than 12 weeks showed a significant advantage of combined treatment over drug treatment alone (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.22-4.03), with a significant reduction in dropouts compared with nonresponders (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.88). These estimates were not affected by study quality.
   Conclusions: Psychological treatment combined with antidepressant therapy is associated with a higher improvement rate than drug treatment alone. In longer therapies, the addition of psychotherapy helps to keep patients in treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the improvement in response attributable to the combination of drug treatment and psychotherapy can be achieved by a combination of pharmacotherapy and a compliance-enhancing intervention.

AB  - The political and economic turmoil that occurred in south-eastern Europe in the last decade of the twentieth century left a legacy of physical damage. This aspect of the conflict has received considerable coverage in the media. However, surprisingly less has been reported about the effects of that turmoil on the health of the people living in the region. In an attempt to identify and synthesize data on these effects, we carried out a systematic review and used the results to put together a searchable online database of documents, reports,,and published material, the majority of which have not previously been easily accessible (http:// www.Ishtm.ac.uk/ecohost/see/index.php). The database covers the period from the early 1990s to 2003 and will be of considerable interest to policy-makers. It contains 762 items, many of them annotated and available for downloading. This paper synthesizes the main findings obtained from the material in the database and emphasizes the need for concerted action to improve the health of people in south-eastern Europe. Furthermore, we also recommend that agencies working in post-conflict situations should invest in developing and maintaining online databases that would be useful to others working in the area.

AB  - Molecular biology has recently contributed significantly to the recognition of selenium (Se)(2) and Se-dependent enzymes as modulators of brain function. Increased oxidative stress has been proposed as a pathomechanism in neurodegenerative diseases including, among others, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Glutathione peroxidases (GPx), thioredoxin reductases, and one methionine-sulfoxide-reductase are selenium-dependent enzymes involved in antioxidant defense and intracellular redox regulation and modulation. Selenium depletion in animals is associated with decreased activities of Se-dependent enzymes and leads to enhanced cell loss in models of neurodegenerative disease. Genetic inactivation of cellular GPx increases the senstivity towards neurotoxins and brain ischemia. Conversely, increased GPx activity as a result of increased Se supply or overexpression ameliorates the outcome in the same models of disease. Genetic inactivation of selenoprotein P leads to a marked reduction of brain Se content, which has not been achieved by dietary Se depletion, and to a movement disorder and spontaneous seizures. Here we review the role of Se for the brain under physiological as well as pathophysiological conditions and highlight recent findings which open new vistas on an old essential trace element.

AB  - The tensionless limit of gauged WZW models arises when the level of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra assumes its critical value, equal to the dual Coxeter number, in which case the central charge of the Virasoro algebra becomes infinite. We examine this limit from the world-sheet and target space viewpoint and show that gravity decouples naturally from the spectrum. Using the two-dimensional black-hole coset SL(2, R)(k)/U(1) as illustrative example, we find for k = 2 that the world-sheet symmetry is described by a truncated version of W-infinity generated by chiral fields with integer spin s greater than or equal to 3, whereas the Virasoro algebra becomes abelian and it can be consistently factored out. The geometry of target space looks like an infinitely curved hyperboloid, which invalidates the effective field theory description and conformal invariance can no longer be used to yield reliable space-time interpretation. We also compare our results with the null gauging of WZW models, which correspond to infinite boost in target space and they describe the Liouville mode that decouples in the tensionless limit. A formal BRST analysis of the world-sheet symmetry suggests that the central charge of all higher spin generators should be fixed to a critical value, which is not seen by the contracted Virasoro symmetry. Generalizations to higher dimensional coset models are also briefly discussed in the tensionless limit, where similar observations are made.

AB  - Converging evidence from human lesion, animal lesion, and human functional neuromiaging studies implicates overlapping neural circuitry in ventral prefrontal cortex in decision-making and reversal learning. The ascending 5-HT and dopamine neurotransmitter systems have a modulatory role in both processes. There is accumulating evidence that measures of decision-making and reversal learning may be useful as functional markers of ventral prefrontal cortex integrity in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Whilst existing measures of decision-making may have superior sensitivity, reversal learning may offer superior selectivity, particularly within prefrontal cortex. Effective decision-making on existing measures requires the ability to adapt behaviour on the basis of changes in emotional significance, and this may underlie the shared neural circuitry with reversal learning.

AB  - Objectives: Racial disparities in infant and maternal mortality have been attributed to the unique stresses faced by Black women in the United States, but the underlying pathophysiological pathways are poorly understood. This paper reviews the literature related to potential causes of racial disparities in infant and maternal mortality. Methods: A review of the literature from 1966 to 2003 was conducted using a series of searches of Medline, obstetrical journals, and bibliographies. The review focused on potential contributing pathophysiological factors to infant and maternal mortality. Results: Racial disparities in neonatal mortality largely result from excess rates of preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal sepsis while racial disparities in maternal mortality reflect greater prevalence and/or severity of cardiovascular/preeclamptic complications, hemorrhage, and infection among African American women. A large body of epidemiological, placental, and pathophysiological evidence suggests that racial disparities in these disparate outcomes result from two distinct, but potentially converging, pathways: infection and vascular. Racial disparities in intrauterine infection and microvascular dysfunction during pregnancy may result from a constellation of environmental and intergenerational risk factors including psychosocial stress, douching, bottle-feeding, lead exposure, diet, intrauterine growth, and genes. Conclusions: Disparities in infant and maternal mortality appear to reflect a confluence of infections and microvascular dysfunction during pregnancy among African American women. Interventions that target these conditions offer promise for reducing racial disparities in these critical outcomes.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neuronal diseases, including ischemic neuronal injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Thioredoxin reduces exposed protein disulfides and couples with peroxiredoxin to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Nerve growth factor (NGF) has profound effects on neurons, including promotion of survival and differentiation via multiple signaling pathways. As for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, the CREB-cAMP responsive element (CRE) pathway is important to the activation of immediate-early genes such as c-fos. Thioredoxin is upregulated by NGF through ERK and the CREB-CRE pathway in PC12 cells. Thioredoxin is necessary for NGF signaling through CRE leading to c-fos expression and also plays a critical role in the NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Therefore, thioredoxin appears to be a neurotrophic cofactor that augments the effect of NGF on neuronal differentiation and regeneration. NGF acts also as a neuronal survival factor. Previous reports showed that thioredoxin exerts a cytoprotective effect in the nervous system. The cytoprotective effect is mediated by enhancing the action of NGF, via the regulation of antiapoptotic signaling, or through its antioxidative stress activity.

AB  - This is the third in a series of papers that present systematic reviews of the prevalence and incidence of psychiatric disorders drawn from studies published between the years January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2000. The series discusses the implications of these epidemiologic findings for mental health policy and practice.
   Objective: To present the results of a systematic review of literature published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2000, that reports epidemiologic estimates of substance-related disorders.
   Method: We conducted a literature search of substance-related epidemiologic studies, using medline and HealthSTAR databases and applying a set of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies. We extracted and analyzed prevalence and incidence data for heterogeneity.
   Results: A total of 19 prevalence studies of substance-related disorders met inclusion criteria for this review. Heterogeneity analyses revealed significant variability across 1-year and lifetime prevalence of both alcohol and other substance use disorders. The corresponding 1-year and lifetime pooled rates were 6.6 per 100 and 13.2 per 100, respectively, for alcohol use disorders and 2.4 per 100 and 2.4 per 100, respectively, for other substance use disorders. We observed variability among countries and also among regions within the same country. In contrast to other drug problems, alcohol use disorders were substantially more common, were more likely to occur among male subjects, and were more likely to be associated with abuse symptoms. For other drugs, dependence was consistently more prevalent than abuse.
   Conclusions: Studies using rigorous and comparable methodologies report significant variability in rates of alcohol and other substance use disorders. These data suggest that different policies and regional practices are associated with variability in rates of disorders. Policy-makers and health planners require regular, regionally sensitive estimates of prevalence rates to respond effectively to unique patterns of need in their constituencies.

AB  - The question as to whether humans perceive, remember, or cognize psychological items simultaneously (i.e., in parallel) or sequentially (i.e., serially) has been of interest to philosophers and psychologists since at least the 19th century. The advent of the information-processing approach to cognition in the 1960s reopened the inquiry, initiating a flood of experiments and models in the literature. Surprisingly for so elemental an issue, persuasive experimental tests have, until recently, proven rather elusive. Several decades of theoretical, methodological, and experimental effort, propelled and shaped by a metes-theoretical perspective, are leading to powerful strategies for assessing this aid related cognitive issues. The present article reviews the theoretical and empirical history of these inquiries and details situations in which decisive experimental tests are possible.

The last years have provided growing insights into the upstream signal transduction which controls the expression and activation of these transcriptional regulators. In particular, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) were considered to confer degeneration by activation of c-Jun. Recent findings, however, demonstrate an essential physiological role of JNKs in the nervous system. Here we review the specific control and dual functions of JNK isoforms which are relevant for the development of the intact brain on the one hand, and which can confer dramatic neurodegenerative effects and microglial activation on the other hand.

AB  - Objective: Molecular genetic approaches provide a novel method of dissecting the heterogeneity of psychotropic drug response. These pharmacogenetic strategies offer the prospect of identifying biological predictors of psychotropic drug response and could provide the means of determining the molecular substrates of drug efficacy and drug-induced adverse events.
   Method: The authors discuss methods issues in executing pharmacogenetic studies, review the first generation of pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drug response, and consider future directions for this rapidly evolving field.
   Results: Pharmacogenetics has been most commonly used in studies of anti-psychotic drug efficacy, antidepressant drug response, and drug-induced adverse effects. Data from antipsychotic drug studies indicate that polymorphisms within the serotonin 2A and dopamine receptor 2 genes may influence drug efficacy in schizophrenia. Moreover, a growing body of data suggests a relationship between the serotonin transporter gene and clinical effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression. A significant relationship between genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 system and drug-induced adverse effects may exist for certain medications. Finally, a number of independent studies point to a significant effect of a dopamine D-3 receptor polymorphism on susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia.
   Conclusions: initial research into the pharmacogenetics of psychotropic drug response suggests that specific genes may influence phenotypes associated with psychotropic drug administration. These results remain preliminary and will require further replication and validation. New developments in molecular biology, human genomic information, statistical methods, and bioinformatics are ongoing and could pave the way for the next generation of pharmacogenetic studies in psychiatry.

AB  - Background Little is known about the extent to which work contributes to the recovery of people with schizophrenia. There is increasing interest in the subject because of new service models and the economic cost of unemployment in people with severe mental illness. Methods A literature search was carried out with the aim of investigating: a) employment rates in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis and the extent to which they have changed over time; b) the barriers to work; c) the factors associated with being employed among people with schizophrenia; and d) whether employment influences other outcomes in schizophrenia. Results There are wide variations in reported employment rates in schizophrenia. Most recent European studies report rates between 10 % and 20%, while the rate in the US is less clear. There is a higher level of employment among first-episode patients. The employment rate in schizophrenia appears to have declined over the last 50 years in the UK. Barriers to getting employment include stigma,discrimination, fear of loss of benefits and a lack of appropriate professional help. The most consistent predictor of employment is previous work history. Working is correlated with positive outcomes in social functioning, symptom levels, quality of life and self esteem, but a clear causal relationship has not been established. Conclusions Very low employment rates are not intrinsic to schizophrenia, but appear to reflect an interplay between the social and economic pressures that patients face, the labour market and psychological and social barriers to working.

AB  - Differences in non-pathological cognitive ageing provide a useful case study for the opportunities and challenges facing cognitive science as it embraces advances in genetics. One replicated contributor to these differences is variability in the gene for apolipoprotein E. Genetic variations that influence neurodegenerative diseases, learning and memory, cardiovascular disease, and oxidative stress are among the candidates for influence on cognitive ageing differences. The area suffers the same problems as other domains in which quantitative trait loci are sought: uncertainty regarding the genetic architecture, unreliable strategies for candidate gene selection, lack of power leading to unreplicated findings, and poor characterisation of the phenotype. However, current progress in genetic knowledge, technology and informatics will contribute to progress in this important area.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated as a common pathogenetic mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders. Central nervous system is particularly exposed to free radical injury, given its high metal content, which can catalyze the formation of oxygen free radicals. and the relatively low content of antioxidant defenses. Indeed, several studies show markers of oxidative damage - lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA oxidation and glycoxidation markers - in brain areas affected by neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress damage is intimately linked to glutamate neurotoxicity - known as "excitotoxicity". An excessive concentration of extracellular glutamate over-activates ionotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in intracellular calcium overload and a cascade of events leading to neural cell death. In this study we reviewed pathogenetic mechanisms that link oxidative stress and excitotoxicity in three neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease) and described peripheral markers of these mechanisms, that may be analyzed in patients as possible diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

AB  - Verbal fluency tasks are frequently used in neuropsychological examinations in order to assess semantic storage integrity and strategic word retrieval in long term memory. Performance is usually analyzed in terms of the total number of correct words belonging to a given semantic category or beginning with a given letter generated in a limited time. However, a quantitative analysis of performance may not fully capture the complexity of the underlying cognitive processes. To address this issue, Troyer et al. (1997) proposed a qualitative analysis method based on the distinction between two dissociable components of fluency performance << clustering >> and << switching >>.
   The aim of the present paper is to review the literature about verbal fluency and to present the method elaborated by Troyer and colleagues, as well as its limitations. The contribution of recent neuropsychological findings in understanding the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these tasks is emphasized.

AB  - For the better part of the past two decades, studies on the molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease have focused on amyloid-beta protein, the major proteinaceous component of senile plaques. In fact, the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis has come to dominate the field both in terms of proposed disease mechanism as well as potential for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we look at the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis from the perspective of pathology, cell biology, and genetics. In all cases, alternate interpretations of old data as well as new evidence indicates that amyloid-beta, far from being the harbinger of disease, actually occurs secondary to more fundamental pathological changes and may even play a protective role in the diseased brain. These findings bring into serious doubt the validity of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis as the central cause of Alzheimer disease and. consequently, the potential usefulness of therapeutic targets against amyloid-beta.

AB  - A growing number of students in American higher education are being diagnosed as 'learning disabled" and then using that diagnosis to secure beneficial "accommodations," such as extra time on exams. These accommodations are often said to be mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This Article challenges the premise that the ADA necessarily requires educational institutions to provide learning disabled students with any accommodations. The ADA defines "disability" as an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Whether one is substantially limited is determined with reference not to one's innate abilities, but to the skills of the average American citizen. Thus, a learning disabled college or law student who fails to live up to his potential, and who reads slower than one would predict given his general mental aptitude, is not disabled as a matter of law, provided he reads at a level comparable to the average American.
   Legal requirements aside, it may be appropriate to accommodate learning disabled students, but it is increasingly difficult to distinguish the truly disabled from those simply claiming a disability to gain an advantage. The traditional touchstone of a medical diagnosis as learning disabled, which diverges importantly from the legal definition, is a substantial discrepancy between a person's mental aptitude and academic achievement. Whatever scientific rigor such a diagnosis may once have had, it is now hopelessly indeterminate. Moreover, there is evidence that significant numbers of students, or at least those with the wherewithal and initiative to consult psychologists and lobby school administrators, can secure such an advantageous diagnosis. Drawing upon the concept of agency costs, this Article explores the tension between the interests of administrators of nonprofit educational entities and the interests of the entities themselves. Educational institutions are of course committed to ensuring fairness and academic integrity, but individual educators and administrators may not have sufficient personal incentives to scrutinize requests for accommodations or to tailor those accommodations narrowly to a student's claimed learning disability.

AB  - A deficiency in the noradrenergic system of the brain, originating largely from cells in the locus coeruleus (LC), is theorized to play a critical role in the progression of a family of neurodegenerative disorders that includes Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consideration is given here to evidence that several neurodegenerative diseases and syndromes share common elements, including profound LC cell loss, and may in fact be different manifestations of a common pathophysiological process. Findings in animal models of PD indicate that the modification of LC-noradrenergic activity alters electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral indices of neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and influences the response of this system to experimental lesions. In models related to AD, noradrenergic mechanisms appear to play important roles in modulating the activity of the basalocortical cholinergic system and its response to injury, and to modify cognitive functions including memory and attention. Mechanisms by which noradrenaline may protect or promote recovery from neural damage are reviewed, including effects on neuroplasticity, neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, inflammation, cellular energy metabolism and excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Based on evidence for facilitatory effects on transmitter release, motor function, memory, neuroprotection and recovery of function after brain injury, a rationale for the potential of noradrenergic-based approaches, specifically alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists, in the treatment of central neurodegencrative diseases is presented.

AB  - Peripheral nerve injury in humans can produce a persistent pain state characterized by spontaneous pain and painful responses to normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia). Here we attempt to identify some of the neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain using an animal model of peripheral neuropathy induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing a 2-mm polyethylene cuff around the left sciatic nerve according to the method of Mosconi and Kruger. von Frey hair testing confirmed tactile allodynia in all cuff-implanted rats before electrophysiological testing. Rats were anesthetized and spinalized for extracellular recording from single spinal wide dynamic range neurons (L3-4). In neuropathic rats (days 11-14 and 42-52 after cuff implantation), ongoing discharge was greater and hind paw receptive field size was expanded compared to control rats. Activation of low-threshold sensory afferents by innocuous mechanical stimulation (0.2 N for 3 s) in the hind paw receptive field evoked the typical brief excitation in control rats. However, in neuropathic rats, innocuous stimulation also induced a nociceptive-like afterdischarge that persisted 2-3 min. This afterdischarge was never observed in control rats, and, in this model, is the distinguishing feature of the spinal neural correlate of tactile allodynia. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve at 4 and at 20 Hz each produced an initial discharge that was identical in control and in neuropathic rats. This stimulation also produced an afterdischarge that was similar at the two frequencies in control rats. However, in neuropathic rats, the afterdischarge produced by 20-Hz stimulation was greater than that produced by 4-Hz stimulation. Given that acutely spinalized rats were studied, only peripheral and/or spinal mechanisms can account for the data obtained; as synaptic responses from C fibers begin to fail above approximately 5-Hz stimulation [Pain 46 (1991) 327], the afterdischarge in response to 20-Hz stimulation suggests a change mainly in myelinated afferents and a predominant role of these fibers in eliciting this afterdischarge. These data are consistent with the suggestion that peripheral neuropathy induces phenotypic changes predominantly in myelinated afferents, the sensory neurons that normally respond to mechanical stimulation. The NK-1 receptor antagonist, CP-99,994 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.), depressed the innocuous pressure-evoked afterdischarge but not the brief initial discharge of wide dynamic range neurons, and decreased the elevated ongoing rate of discharge in neuropathic rats. These results support the concept that following peripheral neuropathy, myelinated afferents may now synthesize and release substance P. A result of this is that tonic release of substance P from the central terminals of these phenotypically altered neurons would lead to ongoing excitation of NK-1-expressing nociceptive spinal neurons. In addition, these spinal neurons would also exhibit exaggerated responses to innocuous pressure stimulation. The data in this study put forth a possible neurophysiological and neurochemical basis of neuropathic pain and identify substance P and the NK-1 receptor as potential neurochemical targets for its management.

AB  - Estrogens affect a variety of behaviors in addition to sexual responses, some of them related to motor activity and emotional reactivity. This is true in experimental animals and in humans. The literatures on these subjects are confusing because not all of the experimental results point in the same direction. Here we propose the following theoretical suggestion, hoping to account for the variety of reports extant: following the generally arousing effects of estrogens, their hormonal actions on motor activity and fear depend on context. In a safe environment. estrogen treatment causes increased activity. But in a novel environment or in contexts otherwise perceived as threatening, activity is reduced by estrogen, due to the hormone's arousing action, which heightens fear. Many hormone-dependent neural circuits involving several neuropeptides could provide mechanisms for this dynamic. We suggest a causal route could involve the activation of corticotropin releasing hormone gene expression in the brain. In sum, estrogenic effects on arousal states, as manifest differently according to details of the environmental context during behavioral test, could account for some of the discrepancies in the literature.

AB  - Background Culture-bound syndrome is a term used to describe the uniqueness of some syndromes in specific cultures. Dhat (semen-loss anxiety) has been considered to be an exotic 'neurosis of the Orient'.
   Aims To ascertain the presence of similar symptoms and syndromes in different cultures and historical settings.
   Method Electronic and manual literature searches were used to gather information on the existence and description of semen-loss anxiety in different cultures and settings.
   Results Most of the empirical studies on dhat syndrome have emerged from Asia, whereas its concepts have been described historically in other cultures, including Britain, the USA and Australia. The different sources indicate the universality of symptoms and global prevalence of this condition, despite its image as a 'neurosis of the Orient'.
   Conclusions It appears that dhat (semen-loss anxiety) is not as culture-bound as previously thought. We propose that the concept of culture-bound syndromes should be modified in line with DSM - IV recommendations.

AB  - Objective: The authors sought to determine the efficacy and acceptability of lithium for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders was conducted. Data were obtained from searching the registers of the Cochrane Collaboration; reviewing reference lists, journals, and conference abstracts; and contacting authors, experts, and pharmaceutical companies. Outcomes investigated included risk of relapse (manic, depressive, and total) as well as risk of specific adverse effects and total withdrawal rates.
   Results: Five randomized controlled trials (770 participants) were included. Lithium was more effective than placebo in preventing all relapses (random effects relative risk = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.84) and manic relapses (relative risk = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.95). The protective effect of lithium on depressive relapses was smaller and was less robust (relative risk = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.49 to 1.07).
   Conclusions: Lithium treatment reduces the risk of relapse in bipolar disorder. The preventive effect is clear for manic episodes, although it is equivocal for depressive episodes.

AB  - Objective: To review the available literature on psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in bipolar disorder (BD) and to give an integral view of these therapies.
   Method: Studies were identified through Medline searches in English language publications between 1971 and 2003. This was supplemented by a hand search and the inclusion of selected descriptive articles on good clinical practice.
   Results: A number of studies demonstrate that psychoeducation enhances adherence to treatment, and one finds that it improves outcome in BD. Other studies find that CBT diminishes depressive symptoms and improves quality of life in BD. Occasionally some adverse effects may occur with psychotherapy and, although they are sporadic, should not be overlooked.
   Conclusion: When combined with pharmacological treatment, psychoeducation helps to improve adherence. Training in the identification of early manic symptoms helps to improve outcomes and decreases the number of manic relapses in BD.

AB  - Background: Influential studies have cast doubt on the validity of retrospective reports by adults of their own adverse experiences in childhood. Accordingly, many researchers view retrospective reports with scepticism. Method: A computer-based search, supplemented by hand searches, was used to identify studies reported between 1980 and 2001 in which there was a quantified assessment of the validity of retrospective recall of sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical/emotional neglect or family discord, using samples of at least 40. Validity was assessed by means of comparisons with contemporaneous, prospectively obtained, court or clinic or research records; by agreement between retrospective reports of two siblings; and by the examination of possible bias with respect to differences between retrospective and prospective reports in their correlates and consequences. Medium- to long-term reliability of retrospective recall was determined from studies in which the test-retest period extended over at least 6 months. Results: Retrospective reports in adulthood of major adverse experiences in childhood, even when these are of a kind that allow reasonable operationalisation, involve a substantial rate of false negatives, and substantial measurement error. On the other hand, although less easily quantified, false positive reports are probably rare. Several studies have shown some bias in retrospective reports. However, such bias is not sufficiently great to invalidate retrospective case-control studies of major adversities of an easily defined kind. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that little weight can be placed on the retrospective reports of details of early experiences or on reports of experiences that rely heavily on judgement or interpretation. Conclusion: Retrospective studies have a worthwhile place in research, but further research is needed to examine possible biases in reporting.

AB  - Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell types in the brain, provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons and modulate synaptic activity. Accordingly, impairment in these astrocyte functions can critically influence neuronal survival. Recent studies show that astrocyte apoptosis may contribute to pathogenesis of many acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We found that incubation of cultured rat astrocytes in a Ca2+-containing medium after exposure to a Ca2+-free medium causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration followed by apoptosis, and that NF-kappaB, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes such as calpain, xanthine oxidase, calcineurin and caspase-3 are involved in reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that heat shock protein, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase are target molecules for anti-apoptotic drugs. This review summarizes (1) astrocytic functions in neuroprotection, (2) current evidence of astrocyte apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies including its molecular pathways such as Ca2+ overload, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protease activation, and (3) several drugs preventing astrocyte apoptosis. As a whole, this article provides new insights into the potential role of astrocytes as targets for neuroprotection. In addition, the advance in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of astrocyte apoptosis may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The cerebellum is an evolutionarily conserved structure critical for motor learning in vertebrates. The model that has influenced much of the work in the field for the past 30 years suggests that motor learning is mediated by a single plasticity mechanism in the cerebellum: long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. However, recent studies of simple behaviors such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) indicate that multiple plasticity mechanisms contribute to cerebellum-dependent learning. Multiple plasticity mechanisms may provide the flexibility required to store memories over different timescales, regulate the dynamics of movement, and allow bidirectional changes in movement amplitude. These plasticity mechanisms must act in combination with appropriate information-coding strategies to equip motor-teaming systems with the ability to express learning in correct contexts. Studies of the patterns of generalization of motor teaming in the VOR provide insight about the coding of information in neurons at sites of plasticity. These principles emerging from studies of the VOR are consistent with results concerning more complex behaviors and thus may reflect general principles of cerebellar function.

AB  - Elevated cortisol in a subset of depressed patients is an enduring and well-replicated finding. Much interest has focused on the possible effects of depression on the hippocampus; however, an emerging body of evidence suggests an association between depression and non-central nervous system illnesses, In this review, data on the effects of depression on the brain and other organ systems sensitive to elevated cortisol are discussed. From searches of the MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Current Contents databases, and other sources, articles were found specifically related to depression and physical changes or medical conditions associated with corticosteroid excess in patients with Cushing's disease, including cognitive impairment, hippocampal atrophy, increased waist-to-hip ratio, bone loss, hypertension, diabetes, peptic ulcers, and hyperlipidemia. Data are strongest for a relationship between elevated cortisol and depression, hippocampal atrophy, cognitive impairment, abdominal obesity, and loss of bone density. Some evidence suggests an association between depression and hypertension, peptic ulcers, and diabetes. Depression does not appear to be associated with hyperlipidemia. The data provide some support for similar health effects in depressed patients and patients with Cushing's disease or the metabolic syndrome; however, additional studies are needed relating systemic effects of depression to cortisol. Limitations of the current literature, treatment implications, and possible directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2004 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Basic principles of knowledge activation and use illuminate relations between knowledge and appraisal, yielding a synthetic account of personality structures and processes. Novel empirical data illustrate the heuristic value of the knowledge/appraisal distinction by showing how self-referent and situational knowledge combine to foster cross-situational coherence in appraisals of self-efficacy.

AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have proven to be the most highly favorable class of drug targets in modem pharmacology. Over 90% of nonsensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain, where they play important roles in numerous neuronal functions. GPCRs can be desensitized following activation by agonists by becoming phosphorylated by members of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Phosphorylated receptors are then bound by arrestins, which prevent further stimulation of G proteins and downstream signaling pathways. Discussed in this review are recent progress in understanding basics of GPCR desensitization, novel functional roles, patterns of brain expression, and receptor specificity of GRKs and betaarrestins in major brain functions. In particular, screening of genetically modified mice lacking individual GRKs or betaarrestins for alterations in behavioral and biochemical responses to cocaine and morphine has revealed a functional specificity in dopamine and mu-opioid receptor regulation of locomotion and analgesia. An important and specific role of GRKs and betaarrestins in regulating physiological responsiveness to psychostimulants and morphine suggests potential involvement of these molecules m certain brain disorders, such as addiction, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, the utility of a pharmacological strategy aimed at targeting this GPCR desensitization machinery to regulate brain functions can be envisaged.

High-resolution developments of MRI and PET, as well as the more recent imaging technology, multiphoton microscopy, for small animal imaging are also analyzed, as rodent models offer an enormous opportunity to study not only the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, and schizophrenia among others, but also potential new treatments for all these diseases.

TI  - Stochastic Gravity: Theory and Applications
AB  - Whereas semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical Einstein equation with sources given by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of quantum fields, stochastic semiclassical gravity is based on the Einstein-Langevin equation, which has in addition sources due to the noise kernel. The noise kernel is the vacuum expectation value of the (operatorvalued) stress-energy bi-tensor which describes the fluctuations of quantum matter fields in curved spacetimes. In the first part, we describe the fundamentals of this new theory via two approaches: the axiomatic and the functional. The axiomatic approach is useful to see the structure of the theory from the framework of semiclassical gravity, showing the link from the mean value of the stress-energy tensor to their correlation functions. The functional approach uses the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path effective action methods which are convenient for computations. It also brings out the open systems concepts and the statistical and stochastic contents of the theory such as dissipation, fluctuations, noise, and decoherence. We then focus on the properties of the stress-energy bi-tensor. We obtain a general expression for the noise kernel of a quantum field defined at two distinct points in an arbitrary curved spacetime as products of covariant derivatives of the quantum field's Green function. In the second part, we describe three applications of stochastic gravity theory. First, we consider metric perturbations in a Minkowski spacetime. We offer an analytical solution of the Einstein-Langevin equation and compute the two-point correlation functions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the metric perturbations. Second, we discuss structure formation from the stochastic gravity viewpoint, which can go beyond the standard treatment by incorporating the full quantum effect of the inflaton fluctuations. Third, we discuss the backreaction of Hawking radiation in the gravitational background of a quasi-static black hole (enclosed in a box). We derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation between the fluctuations in the radiation and the dissipative dynamics of metric fluctuations.

The goal of this chapter is to summarize research findings on the central themes and salient issues of midlife such as balancing work and family responsibilities in the midst of the physical and psychological changes associated with aging. ne field of midlife development is emerging in the context of large demographic shifts in the population. A section on the phenomenology of midlife development presents images and expectations including the seemingly disparate views of midlife as a time of peak functioning and a period of crisis. Conceptual frameworks useful for studying the multiple patterns of change in midlife are presented. Findings demonstrating patterns of gains and losses are reviewed for multiple domains: cognitive functioning, personality and the self, emotions, social relationships, work, and physical health. The need for future research to illuminate and integrate the diverse aspects of midlife is highlighted.

AB  - NMR characterization of biological tissues or materials (MR elastography) is a challenging and promising area of research. A review of ongoing progress in acoustic wave detection and characterization using NMR is given. After recalling some basic physical principles of acoustics (strain-stress relationship, viscoelasticity), NMR methods for shear or longitudinal wave detection are described, emphasizing pioneer works. Both spectroscopic and imaging methods are summarized, as well as a variety of procedures that allow reconstruction of (visco)elastic properties from NMR data. Emergent MR elastography (MRE) techniques were applied on inert materials for validation purposes. Relevant results were obtained on biological samples and in humans in vivo..The clinical use of MRE dedicated to virtual palpation is nowadays clearly envisaged. MR elastography is also compared to another developing approach, namely ultrasonic elastography which exhibits complementary advantages and drawbacks.

AB  - Research oil violent television and films, video games,. and music reveals unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both. immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = .13 to .32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community, (e.g., effect of aspirin oil heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent it? overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence., The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions.
   Short-term. exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence.
   Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal. and triggering all automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts. interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization).
   Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can. influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression,. but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children's media use). However, extant research oil moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence.
   Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore,, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and,violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful.
   Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth.

AB  - Objective: The authors systematically evaluated the published evidence to assess the effectiveness of disease management programs in depression.
   Method: English-language articles on depression were identified through a MEDLINE search for the period from January 1987 to June 2001. Two reviewers evaluated 16,952 published titles, identified 24 depression disease management programs that met explicit inclusion criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, interventions used, and outcome measures. Pooled effect sizes were calculated by using a random-effects model.
   Results: Pooled results for disease management program effects on symptoms of depression showed statistically significant improvements (effect size=0.33, N=24). Programs also had statistically significant effects on patients' satisfaction with treatment (effect size=0.51, N=6), patients' compliance with the recommended treatment regimen (effect size=0.36, N=7), and adequacy of prescribed treatment (effect size=0.44, N=11). One program with an explicit screening component showed significant improvement in the rate of detection of depression by primary care physicians (effect size=0.66); two other programs lacking a screening component showed small nonsignificant improvements in the detection rate (effect size=0.18). Disease management programs increased health care utilization (effect size=-0.10, N=8), treatment costs (effect size=-1.03, N=3), and hospitalization (effect size= 0.20, N=2).
   Conclusions: Disease management appears to improve the detection and care of patients with depression. Further research is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of disease management in depression, and consideration should be given to more widespread implementation of these programs.

AB  - Until about 10 years ago. knowledge of the functional organisation of the central pathways that subserve cardiovascular responses to homeostatic challenges and other stressors was based almost entirely on studies in anaesthetised animals. More recently, however, many studies have used the method of the expression of immediate early genes, particularly the c-fos gene, to identify populations of central neurons that are activated by such challenges in conscious animals. In this review we first consider the advantages and limitations of this method. Then, we discuss how the application of the method of immediate early gene expression, when used alone or in combination with other methods. has contributed to our understanding of the central mechanisms that regulate the autonomic and neuroendocrine response to various cardiovascular challenges (e.g., hypotension, hypoxia, hypovolemia, and other stressors) as they operate in the conscious state. In general, the results of studies of central cardiovascular pathways using immediate early gene expression are consistent with previous studies in anaesthetised animals, but in addition have revealed other previously unrecognised pathways that also contribute to cardiovascular regulation. Finally, we briefly consider recent evidence indicating that immediate early gene expression can modify the functional properties of central cardiovascular neurons, and the possible significance of this in producing long-term changes in the regulation of the cardiovascular system both in normal and pathological conditions.

AB  - Changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system are characteristic of depression, and in the majority of these patients these result in HPA axis hyperactivity. This is further supported by the reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), on the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, during the DEX suppression test and the DEX-corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) test. Because the effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by intracellular receptors including, most notably, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), several studies have examined the number and/or function of GRs in depressed patients. These studies have consistently demonstrated that GR function is impaired in major depression, resulting in reduced GR-mediated negative feedback on the HPA axis and increased production and secretion of CRH in various brain regions postulated to be involved in the causality of depression. This article summarizes the literature on GR in depression and on the impact of antidepressants on the GR in clinical and preclinical studies, and supports the concept that impaired GR signaling is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of depression, in the absence of clear evidence of decreased GR expression. The data also indicate that antidepressants have direct effects on the GR, leading to enhanced GR function and increased GR expression. Hypotheses regarding the mechanism of these receptor changes involve nonsteroid compounds that regulate GR function via second messenger pathways, such as cytokines and neurotransmitters. Moreover, we present recent evidence suggesting that membrane steroid transporters such as the multidrag resistance (MDR) p-glycoprotein, which regulate access of glucocorticoids to the brain, could be a fundamental target of antidepressant treatment. Research in this field Will lead to new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.

AB  - Memory-related areas, such as the hippocampus, should be able to sort out the more significant from the less relevant aspects of an experience in order to transform only the earlier into long-term memory. We have recently suggested the Emotional Tagging concept, according to which the activation of the amygdala in emotionally arousing events mark the experience as important and aids in enhancing synaptic plasticity in other brain regions.
   Here, we review evidence from both human and animal studies that lend support to the Emotional Tagging hypothesis and to the central role the amygdala may play in its formation. We further speculate on potential neural mechanisms that may underlie emotional tagging. Long-term memory formation is considered to involve lasting alterations in synaptic efficacy, known as synaptic plasticity. It has been suggested that two factors are crucial for obtaining a synapse-specific long-term plasticity: (a) the successful activation of a synapse-specific, protein synthesis-independent tag, and (b) the activation of synapse-non-specific protein synthesis. The activation of protein synthesis can then induce lasting plasticity only in those synapses marked by a tag. Interestingly and relevant to the Emotional Tagging hypothesis, it has been recently shown that the activation of the amygdala could transform transient into long-lasting plasticity.
   These recent findings seem to fit well with the Emotional Tagging hypothesis. It seems reasonable to assume that the activation of the amygdala triggers neuromodulatory systems, which in turn reduce the threshold for the activation of the synaptic tag, and by this facilitate the transformation of early- into late-phase memory.

AB  - Reeler (rl/rl) and reeler/wild-type (+/rl) mice synthesize Reln at subnormal rates, as do patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, thereby forming the basis for a Reln hypothesis for vulnerability to these psychopathologies and justifying attention to the behavioral phenotypes of Reln-deficient mice. Tests of gait, emotionality, social aggression, spatial working memory, novel-object detection, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor reflex modulation revealed the behavioral phenotype of rl/rl. but not +/rl, mice to be different from that of wild-type (+/+) mice. These results reveal no effect of Reln gene dosage and provide significant challenges to both the Reln and the neurodevelopmental hypotheses of the etiology of major psychopathologies.

AB  - Near-global fertility decline began in the 1960s, and from the 1980s an increasing number of European countries and some Asian ones achieved very low fertility (total fertility below 1.5) with little likelihood of completed cohort fertility reaching replacement level. Earlier theory aiming at explaining this phenomenon stressed the incompatibility between post-industrial society and behaviour necessary for population replacement. Recent theory has been more specific, often concentrating on the current Italian or Spanish situations or on the contrast between them and the situation in either Scandinavia or the English-speaking countries, or both. Such an approach ignores important evidence, especially that from German-speaking populations. The models available concentrate on welfare systems and family expenses, omitting circumstances that may be unique to individual countries or longer-term factors that may be common to all.

AB  - In the first part of this article, the authors argue that any conception of wellbeing is culturally embedded and depends on how the notions of "well" and "being" are defined and practiced in different cultural communities. To support this argument, they conduct a comprehensive review of the empirical literature, which shows that members of individualistic and collectivistic cultures differ in their emotional experience of wellbeing. This difference has been traced to the indigenous psychology of selfhood in those cultures. In the second part of the article, the authors debunk the myth of infinite cultural variability, while retaining the basic insight concerning the cultural constitution of well-being. They develop a theoretical model of well-being, in which agency and communion are universal dimensions of well-being, and people in different cultures require different combinations of agency and communion to experience well-being. Following this theoretical development, the authors examine cultural impediments to the good life in individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The mutual incompatibility of agency and communion is ruled out as a possible cause of why it is so difficult to live the good life. Instead, the authors propose a dialectical synthesis of agency and communion as a way of dealing with this challenge of living the good life.

AB  - Postnatal depression is a major source of morbidity among women who have recently delivered a child. Considering its high prevalence and serious negative consequences, prevention should be a high priority. A comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge of prevention strategies is important for clinical practice and future research. Searches of MEDLINE and PsychINFO were performed to identify English-language articles of randomized, controlled trials published from 1990 to 2003 focusing on primary prevention of postnatal depression in both the general and high-risk populations. Nineteen studies meeting these criteria were identified. The main findings and limitations of each study are documented. While the results are mixed, several of the studies provide support for the role of midwife intervention for pregnant and postnatal women, There are also some data that support the efficacy of brief psychotherapy in primary prevention. Unfortunately, many of the studies suffer from shortcomings that may limit their generalizability. Data is also lacking on biological interventions. Directions for future research are discussed, and general recommendations for prevention of postnatal depression in clinical practice are made. The findings of this review indicate that despite the relatively brief history of work in this area, progress is being made in identifying possible prevention interventions.

Two on-line methodologies, eye movements and event-related potentials, stand out in the search for the holy grail-an absolute time measure of when, how and why we recognize visual words while reading. Although each technique has its own experimental limitations, we suggest, by means of review and comparison, that these two methodologies can be used in complementary ways to produce a better picture of the mental action we call reading.

AB  - Caring for a family member with dementia is generally regarded as a chronically stressful process, with potentially negative physical health consequences. However, no quantitative analysis has been conducted on this literature. The authors combined the results of 23 studies to compare the physical health of caregivers with demographically similar noncaregivers. When examined across 11 health categories, caregivers exhibited a slightly greater risk for health problems than did noncaregivers. However, sex and the health category assessed moderated this relationship. Stronger relationships occurred with stress hormones, antibodies, and global reported health. The authors argue that a theoretical model is needed that relates caregiver stressors to illness and proffers moderating roles for vulnerabilities and resources and mediating roles for psychosocial distress and health behaviors.

AB  - Today we have the first therapeutic compounds for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) e.g. acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and in the near future we may expect new compounds such as gamma- and beta-secretase inhibitors. This has demanded increased accuracy in the diagnosis of AD and thus, among other possible approaches, diagnostic markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have become a rapidly growing research field. Especially early in the course or the disease, when correct diagnosis is most difficult, such biomarkers would be especially valuable as one might expect the compounds to have the greatest potential or being effective. Two of the defining lesions in AD brains are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins as the main components respectively. Abeta and tau proteins are secreted to body fluids including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this paper we review CSF markers for AD, with focus on their role in the clinical diagnosis. Reduced CSF levels of the 42 amino acid form of Abeta (Abeta42) and increased CSF levels of total tau (T-tau) in AD have been found in numerous studies, with high sensitivity figures. However, the specificity against other dementias is lower. The addition of phospho tau (beta-tau) seems to increase the specifiicity since normal levels are found in other dementias and in cerebrovascular disease. An increasing number of studies suggests that these CSF markers perform well enough to have a role in the clinical work-up of patients with dementia if used together. We stress that the CSF markers should be combined with the clinical information and brain-imaging techniques.

AB  - GeneChip(R) microarrays have recently been introduced to the field of neurobiology to identify and monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. This powerful technique is now used for studying the pathophysiology of CNS injuries including spinal cord lesions. Early stages after injury are characterized by the strong upregulation of genes involved in transcription and inflammation and a general downregulation of structural proteins and proteins involved in neurotransmission. Later, an increase in the expression of growth factors, axonal guidance factors, extracellular matrix molecules and angiogenic factors reflects the attempts for repair, while upregulation of stress genes and proteases and downregulation of cytoskeletal and synaptic mRNA reflect the struggle of the tissue to survive. DNA microarrays have the potential to aid discovery of new targets for neuroprotective or restorative therapeutic approaches.

   Method: Contemporary and older seminal literature was reviewed for psychodynamic, cognitive - behavioural, reminiscence and systemic family therapies treating older patients.
   Results: The main findings supported the experience of staff in old age psychiatry that if the reluctance of referrers and sometimes of older patients themselves can be overcome this type of work is valuable and effective.
   Conclusions: Each patient is unique. Generalizations are not always appropriate, however, with advancing years some common themes emerge in therapeutic work. It may be necessary to make modifications to the therapeutic technique to accommodate the difficulties experienced by people in later life but also to use their strengths. Staff working in this field need to have the capacity to be aware of and to understand their own feelings and prejudices about the second half of life. For patients not offered formal therapy a psychotherapeutic approach will nevertheless enhance their psychiatric care. Although the body of research is growing, more work needs to be done in evaluating all of the psychotherapies offered to older people.

AB  - Clinically, Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) is often overlooked as its occurrence in Western countries is rare. However, its neurological, cognitive and psychiatric sequelae constitute a major public health problem in the Far East where JBE is endemic. European and American subjects may however experience the JBE when returning from a Far East journey. In such cases, misdiagnosis is frequent because of the unawareness of psychiatrists and physicians. The present review, therefore, documents the behavioural and cognitive sequelae of JBE. This reactivates the debate concerning the vaccination against the virus all the more that the literature enlightens the importance of the vaccination for those who undertake frequent and extensive tourist excursions to the Orient but still discusses it for occasional travellers. Following is a case-report of a young western European post-graduate student who has contracted JBE by experiencing an acute febrile delirium during an unusual short stay in South East Asia. Pyramidal syndrome, Parkinsonism and amnesia were the prominent acute deficits. Whereas these faded in great part during convalescence, emotional and behavioural instability associated with affective involvement, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and cognitive impairments appeared. A partial recovery was however obtained with neuroleptics, lithium and following electroconvulsive therapy. Organic personality syndrome was persistent and thereafter constituted the main sequelae syndrome. Hypersomnia and several enuretic episodes persisted.

AB  - Neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are widely used to identify the cerebral correlates of cognitive tasks. The resting state presents the advantage to serve as a reference in all experiments but is also an ill-defined mental state because it may vary both from one subject to another and within the same subject. The most challenging question concerns the areas whose activity (revealed by PET or fMRI imaging) is greater in rest state than in an active condition. The present work reports the result of a meta-analysis including five previously published studies. The five different tasks involved are the following: attribution of intention, judgement of stimulus pleasantness, discrimination of spatial attributes, judgement of other peoples' belief and perception of gaze.
   For each study, the general linear model was used to assess statistical difference and a contrast resting state minus other conditions was calculated. The intersection of the five contrasts was used to search for the variation jointly observed across the different experiments. This lead to a reduced number of clusters: one cluster in the lower/anterior part of the cingulate gyrus and four clusters located in the medial/superior frontal gyrus, along the superior frontal sulcus.
   We discuss the location of these areas with respect to the location of activations induced by different tasks: externally focused attention, memory, general reasoning, theory of mind and self-referential tasks. We observed that medial prefrontal cortex exhibits a lower activity when the subject's attention is focused towards the external world than when the subject has to additionally refer to some internal states. By contrast, this activity is greater during resting state than during both externally directed and internally directed attention. Thus, we hypothesize that during rest, the subject is in a state where he refers only to his own self. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current PD medications treat symptoms; none halt or retard dopaminergic neuron degeneration. The main obstacle to developing neuroprotective therapies is a limited understanding of the key molecular events that provoke neurodegeneration. The discovery of PD genes has led to the hypothesis that misfolding of proteins and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are pivotal to PD pathogenesis. Previously implicated culprits in PD neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, may also act in part by causing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in addition to producing other deleterious events in dopaminergic neurons. Neurotoxin-based models (particularly MPTP) have been important in elucidating the molecular cascade of cell death in dopaminergic neurons. PD models based on the manipulation of PD genes should prove valuable in elucidating important aspects of the disease, such as selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to the degenerative process.

AB  - The integrity of the vasculature and the maintenance of the blood supply to the brain are crucial for the survival of higher vertebrates. However, peripheral mechanisms of sealing the vasculature that rely on the clotting of blood and platelet aggregation around the site of a 'leak' would lead to decreased cerebral perfusion and compromise the viability of terminally differentiated and irreplaceable neurons. Therefore, in higher organisms it is likely that a sealant/anti-coagulant system that maintains vascular supply has evolved as a necessity to life. We propose that one such system involves the amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) and its cleavage product Abeta since (1) both AbetaPP/Abeta are known to deposit in the media of the cerebrovasculature wall following localized injury, (2) Abeta is generated from AbetaPP, a known acute phase reactant, (3) Abeta's physiochemical properties allow it to span between the extracellular matrix and the (endothelial) cell membrane and under inflammatory conditions aggregate to form an intracranial 'scab', thereby maintaining structural integrity of the blood brain barrier, (4) AbetaPP/Abeta together act as an anti-coagulant, (5) Abeta promotes vascular/neuronal remodeling, and (6) Abeta deposits resolve after injury. These properties are consistent with the acute phase generation and rapid cortical deposition of AbetaPP/Abeta following injury (either sustained by trauma or stresses associated with aging) that would be an important compensatory response aimed at limiting the loss of terminally differentiated neurons. Such a system would allow the maintenance of blood supply to the brain by sealing vascular lesions, preventing hemorrhagic stroke while at the same time inhibiting the coagulation cascade from blocking capillaries. Obviously, strategies to remove Abeta would have serious consequences for the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, recent in vivo evidence demonstrates that the removal of deposited Abeta from the vasculature leads to increased cerebral microhemorrhage and strongly support the above mentioned functions of AbetaPP/Abeta. These insights also explain the root cause of the encephalitis and meningitis suffered by individuals in immunotherapy trials as being directly associated with the removal of Abeta from the vasculature, i.e. immunological responses to Abeta vaccination do not discriminate between physiologically purposive deposits of Abeta (vascular deposits) and pathological deposits of Abeta (senile plaques).

AB  - Background: The fundamental social disturbance of autism is characterized, in part, by problems in the acquisition of joint attention skills in the first years of life, followed by impairments in the development of social cognition, as assessed on theory of mind (ToM) measures. Recently, studies have indicated that a system involving the dorsal medial-frontal cortex (DMFC), and the anterior cingulate (AC), may contribute to the development of the tendency to initiate joint attention in infancy. Similarly, research has implicated the DMFC/AC system in ToM performance in typical and atypical individuals. These data suggest it may be useful to consider the functions associated with this system in the developmental psychopathology of autism. Method: A review of the studies of the connections between the DMFC/AC system, joint attention and ToM task performance. Results and conclusions: This review raises the hypothesis that the DMFC/AC may be involved in the basic disturbance in social orienting in autism. The DMFAC/AC may also play a role in the capacity to monitor proprioceptive information concerning self-action and integrate this self-related information with exteroceptive perceptual information about the behavior of other people. A disturbance in these functions of the DMFC/AC may contribute to the atypical development of intersubjectivity, joint attention and social cognition that may impair the lives of people with autism. Thus, impairment in the development of this system may constitute a neural substrate for socio-cognitive deficits in autism.

AB  - Objective: Major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms have been identified as independent risk factors for cardiac mobidity and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease. Increased susceptibility to platelet activation has been proposed as one of the mechanisms by which depression acts as a significant risk factor for thrombotic events. In this review, data on platelet activation and platelet aggregation measures in depressed patients with or without concomitant cardiovascular disease are given. Data on the influence of antidepressants on parameters of platelet activation are summarized. Methods: A literature search was done by checking MEDLINE Advanced and PsycInfo from 1990 to 2003 and through checking the bibliographies of these sources. The following key words were used for this search: platelet activation, platelet aggregation, depression, depressive disorder, ischemic heart disease, calcium, and serotonin. Results: There is an indication of enhanced platelet activation and aggregation in depressed patients. Next, patients with a depressive disorder show signs of a hyperactive platelet 5-HT2A receptor signal transduction system as measured by increased platelet calcium mobilization after stimulation of platelets with serotonin. Conclusions: Depression appears to be associated with an increased susceptibility for scrotonin-mediated platelet activation. Upregulation and/or increased sensitivity of 5-HT2A/1B receptors and downregulated 5-HT transporter receptors in the periphery may contribute to increased risk of thromboembolic events in patients with depression and cardiovascular disease. Increased platelet reactivity based on a hyperreactive 5-HT2A receptor signaling system might be influenced by antidepressive medication that antagonizes platelet 5-HT2A receptors.

AB  - Neocortex contains very few galanin neurons but receives a moderate galanin innervation from various subcortical loci. Recent data suggest that galanin helps regulate the tonic neuronal excitability of hippocampus and probably cerebral cortex but relatively little is known about the anatomy and functional regulation of cortical galanin systems. Therefore, we examined, in the rat, the effect of the intense but benign stimulus, cortical spreading depression (CSD), on the expression of galanin and galanin receptors (GaIR1 and GaIR2) in the neocortex and associated regions, revealing complex, multicellular responses. Thus, following acute, unilateral KCl-induced CSD, a delayed and transient induction (onset after 48 h, lasting similar to24 h) of galanin mRNA and peptide production occurred across the ipsilateral cerebral cortex in activated oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), identified by specific NG2 proteoglycan immunostaining. An increase in GaIR1 mRNA, immunoreactivity and receptor binding occurred in neurons within layers II and V of neocortex and in piriform cortex at 7-28 days after CSD, associated with a long-lasting depletion of galanin-positive nerve fibres in these regions. In contrast, GaIR2 mRNA expression was largely unaltered after CSD. Additional novel findings in normal, adult brain were the detection of galanin mRNA and immunoreactivity in OPCs within the medial corpus callosum and in immature progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream. GaIR1 and GaIR2 mRNA was also present in these latter regions. These findings and the complex modulation of galanin and galanin receptors in multiple cell types (neurons/OPCs) following acute cortical activation/depression further demonstrate the potential plasticity of neuronal and non-neuronal galanin systems under physiological and pathological conditions and strongly suggest additional functions for this pleiotropic peptide in mammalian brain.

AB  - This review for the first time systematizes the results of our investigations into the influence of magnetic effects on the mechanical properties and the real structure of nonmagnetic crystals. It is found that the preliminary magnetic treatment of alkali halide crystals leads to a decrease in their solubility and a change in the microhardness and yield stress. The magnetic field strongly affects the macroplasticity of LiF, NaCl, and PbS crystals under deformation in a magnetic field. This is accompanied by a change in the shape of stress-strain curves, a shortening of deformation stages, a change in the hardening coefficients, and a decrease in the yield stress. It is revealed that the magnetic effects exhibit threshold behavior. The yield stress is measured as a function of the magnetic induction and the strain rate. It is established that the magnetic and electric fields have a joint effect on the kinetics of plastic deformation. A kinematic model of the macroscopic magnetoplastic effect is proposed.

AB  - Objective: To analyze new and reviewed findings to evaluate relations between treatment response and latency from onset of bipolar disorder (BD) to the start of mood-stabilizer prophylaxis.
   Method: We analyzed our own new data and added findings from research reports identified by computerized searching.
   Results: We found 11 relevant studies, involving 1485 adult patients diagnosed primarily with BD. Reported latency to prophylaxis averaged 9.6 years (SD 1.3), and follow-up in treatment averaged 5.4 years (SD 3.1). Greater illness intensity and shorter treatment latency were closely associated, resulting in a greater apparent reduction in morbidity with earlier treatment. However, this finding was not sustained after correction for pretreatment morbidity, and treatment latency did not predict morbidity during treatment, Therefore, assessments based on improvement with treatment, or without correction for pretreatment morbidity, can be misleading.
   Conclusions: Available evidence does not support the proposal that delayed prophylaxis may limit response to prophylactic treatment in BD and related disorders. (Can J Psychiatry 2003:48:449-457)

AB  - Objective: This systematic review examines the evidence and discusses the clinical relevance of lithium augmentation as a treatment strategy for refractory major depressive episodes. It also examines hypotheses on the mode of action of lithium augmentation, with a focus on serotonin (5-HT) and neuroendocrine systems, and proposes recommendations for future research.
   Method: We searched the Medline computer database and the Cochrane Library for relevant original studies published in English from January 1966 to February 2003. The key words were as follows: lithium, augmentation strategies, lithium augmentation, major depression, refractory depression, treatment-resistant depression, neuroendocrinology, and serotonin.
   Results: Of 27 prospective clinical studies published since 1981, 10 were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 4 were randomized comparator trials, and 13 were open-label trials. Five of 9 acute-phase placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that lithium augmentation had substantial efficacy. In the acute-treatment trials, the average response rate in the lithium group was 45%, and in the placebo group, 18% (P < 0.001). One placebo-controlled trial showed the efficacy of lithium augmentation in the continuation-phase treatment. Summarizing the open and controlled data, approximately 50% of patients responded to lithium augmentation within 2 to 6 weeks. Animal studies offer robust evidence that lithium augmentation increases 5-HT neurotransmission, possibly by a synergistic action of lithium and the antidepressant on brain 5-HT pathways.
   Conclusions: Augmentation of antidepressants with lithium is the best-documented augmentation therapy in the treatment of refractory depression. Emerging data from animal studies suggest that the 5-HTergic system is involved in the augmentatory effect of lithium. (Can J Psychiatry 2003;48:440 146)

AB  - We investigated the frequency-dependent transition from homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) to long-term potentiation (LTP) at the lateral perforant pathway/dentate gyrus synapse in adult (90 days of age) and immature (15 days of age) awake, freely moving rats. Dentate-evoked field potentials were recorded and analyzed using the population spike amplitude and the field EPSP slope measures following sustained stimulation (900 pulses) of the lateral perforant pathway at various frequencies (1, 3, 7, 30, 50, or 200 Hz). Our results indicate that both the strength and the direction (LTP or LTD) of synaptic plasticity vary as a function of activation frequency: sustained low-frequency stimulation ranging from 1 to 7 Hz results in depression of activated synapses, whereas high-frequency stimulation (30-200 Hz) produces potentiation. In addition, a significant (P < 0.01) ontogenetic shift in the frequency of transition from LTD to LTP was observed; the transition frequency in immature animals was significantly lower than that obtained in adult animals. These observations agree strongly with the prediction of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro theory of synapse modification, indicating perhaps a neurophysiological basis for this theoretical model of learning in the dentate gyrus of awake behaving rats.

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric and neurological patients frequently try herbal medicines often under the assumption that they are safe. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a summary of recent data on severe psychiatric and neurological adverse effects of herbal remedies.
   Method: Computerized literature searches were carried out to identify all reports of psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with herbal medicines. These data were subsequently extracted, validated and summarized in narrative and tabular form.
   Results: Numerous case reports comprise a diverse array of adverse events including cerebral arteritis, cerebral oedema, delirium, coma, confusion, encephalopathy, hallucinations, intracerebral haemorrhage, and other types of cerebrovascular accidents, movement disorders, mood disturbances, muscle weakness, paresthesiae and seizures. Several fatalities are on record. They are caused by improper use, toxicity of herbal ingredients, contamination and adulteration of preparations and herb/drug interactions.
   Conclusion: Herbal medicines can cause serious psychiatric and neurological adverse effects.

Four diagnostic purposes have been identified: (i) classification according to a diagnostic system; (ii) screening for probable cases; (iii) dimensional measurement of syndrome severity; and (iv) assessment of associated clinical features. Existing instruments designed for each of these strategies are described, including specifications of their psychometric properties, particular features, advantages and disadvantages. A conclusion of this review is that the currently existing family of assessment instruments' in the field of somatoform, disorders should be used to improve the comparability of scientific findings in different cultures and settings.

AB  - Depressive syndromes are a group of heterogeneous disorders. Atypical depression (AD) with reversed vegetative signs, such as hyperphagia or hypersomnia, is traditionally neglected, demonstrated by the fact that in the most widely used depression scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), melancholic symptoms have a specific weight, while, by contrast. reversed vegetative signs are not included. However, epidemiologically and phenomenologically related disorders to AD do exist, such as somatoform disorders, neurasthenia (chronic fatigue syndrome) and fibromyalgia (FM). In this spectrum, here called the AD spectrum, instead a decrease in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity seems to exist. This has similarities to Cushing's disease, where a suppression of central HPA system activity is accompanied by features of AD and somatization in a considerable number of patients. Opposite vegetative features might therefore be related to the opposite dysregulation of the HPA system. The psychopharmacological intervention in the AD spectrum should therefore differ from that used in typical major depression. MAO inhibitors, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants and 5-HT3 antagonists demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, but the existing studies focused on different aspects. Hypericum extracts might be an alternative pharmacological intervention, which demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in the symptom range of the spectrum.

   Results: A paucity of evidence-based information currently exists. Even so, specific indications from the existing literature can be suggested for several classes of psychotropics, particularly in conduct disorder (CD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorders, and other conditions.
   Conclusions: Clinicians can use finings from reviewed controlled and, where necessary, uncontrolled studies to inform pharmacologic practice. This review offers suggestions for future research directions that will aid clinical practice.

AB  - The piezoelectricity observed in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers involves three components that are associated with the presence of at least two phases (crystalline and amorphous) in the polymer structure. The main contributions to the phenomenon observed are made by the size effect and electrostriction, which are related to each other. These contributions manifest themselves through the mechanism of strain-induced reversible transformations of a number of domains of the anisotropic amorphous phase into the crystalline state under the action of mechanical or electrical fields. With due regard for different packings of chains in the amorphous and crystalline phases, this mechanism accounts for the large Poisson ratios mu(31) obtained for textured films of flexible-chain crystallizing polymers. The dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient d(32) on the static stress in textured films is governed by the change in the fraction of the crystalline phase due to strong anisotropy of the elastic constants in the film plane. It is shown that the shear deformations of polymers are characterized by a strong piezoelectric response. The specific features revealed in the piezoelectric effect under bending deformations are described for films with an inhomogeneous distribution of polarization over the cross section. The general regularities of the electrostriction in the polymers and inorganic relaxor ferroelectrics studied are considered. (C) 2003 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica".

AB  - Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. Land area globally affected by erosion is 1094 million ha (Mha) by water erosion, of which 751 Mha is severely affected, and 549 Mha by wind erosion, of which 296 Mha is severely affected. Whereas the effects of erosion on productivity and non-point source pollution are widely recognized, those on the C dynamics and attendant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are not. Despite its global significance, erosion-induced carbon (C) emission into the atmosphere remains misunderstood and an unquantified component of the global carbon budget. Soil erosion is a four-stage process involving detachment, breakdown, transport/redistribution and deposition of sediments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is influenced during all four stages. Being a selective process, erosion preferentially removes the light organic fraction of a low density of < 1.8 Mg/m(3). A combination of mineralization and C export by erosion causes a severe depletion of the SOC pool on eroded compared with uneroded or slightly eroded soils. In addition, the SOC redistributed over the landscape or deposited in depressional sites may be prone to mineralization because of breakdown of aggregates leading to exposure of hitherto encapsulated C to microbial processes among other reasons. Depending on the delivery ratio or the fraction of the sediment delivered to the river system, gross erosion by water may be 75 billion Mg, of which 15-20 billion Mg are transported by the rivers into the aquatic ecosystems and eventually into the ocean. The amount of total C displaced by erosion on the earth, assuming a delivery ratio of 10% and SOC content of 2-3%, may be 4.0-6.0 Pg/year. With 20% emission due to mineralization of the displaced C, erosion-induced emission may be 0.8-1.2 Pg C/year on the earth. Thus, soil erosion has a strong impact on the global C cycle and this component must be considered while assessing the global C budget. Adoption of conservation-effective measures may reduce the risks of C emission and sequester C in soil and biota. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Single-session psychological interventions such as psychological debriefing have become widely used following traumatic events. The evidence for their effectiveness has been widely debated. This review aimed to consider the evidence for the effectiveness of one-off early interventions within 1 month of a traumatic event. Methods: A systematic review using the standard Cochrane Collaboration methodology. Literature searches of various databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials. The methodological quality of the studies identified was determined using standard measures, and the results were pooled to consider the overall evidence for effectiveness. Results: Eleven randomised controlled trials were found, all of individual or couple interventions. Three studies associated the intervention with a positive outcome, 6 demonstrated no difference in outcome between intervention and non-intervention groups and 2 showed some negative outcomes in the intervention group (these studies had the longest follow-up periods). The methodological quality of the studies varied widely, but was generally poor. This review suggests that early optimism for brief early psychological interventions including debriefing was misplaced and that it should not be advocated for routine use. There remains an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of group debriefing and other early interventions. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Startle and corrugator supercilii responses, and baseline orbicularis oculi and corrugator supercilii electromyographic (EMG) activity, were measured during each exercise condition while participants viewed pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures. The exercise conditions did not alter the magnitude of the startle or corrugator responses compared with the resting control condition. Baseline orbicularis EMG increased slightly and baseline corrugator EMG increased significantly, during the low intensity exercise condition. In conclusion, low intensity physical activity is not sufficient to after emotional responsiveness as assessed by the acoustic startle eyeblink response and corrugator supercilii EMG responses during the viewing of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Despite modestly increased baseline EMG levels, reliable startle and corrugator EMG responses can be obtained in healthy college females during picture viewing while performing low intensity cycling exercise.

AB  - Objective: To compare responses to long-term treatment of rapid-cycling (RC) vs. non-RC bipolar disorder patients and assess relative effectiveness of specific agents in RC patients.
   Method: Studies identified by literature searching were analyzed for effects of RC status and treatment-type on clinical outcome (recurrence or non-improvement per exposure-time), using random-effects methods to estimate pooled rates and their 95% CI for quantitative meta-analytic modeling.
   Results: Data were obtained from 16 reports with 25 trial-arms involving 1856 (905 RC and 951 non-RC) patients treated with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lithium, topiramate, or valproate, alone or with other agents over an average of 47.5 months (7347 total patient-years). Estimated RC prevalence was 15.4%. Crude rates (%/month) of recurrence (2.31/1.20) and clinical non-improvement (1.93/0.49) averaged 2.9-fold greater in RC vs. non-RC subjects. The pooled RC/non-RC risk ratio (RR) for inferior treatment-response (in 13 direct comparisons) was 1.40 (CI 1.26-1.56; P < 0.0001). Pooled crude recurrence and non-improvement rates suggested no clear advantage for any treatment, nor superiority for anticonvulsants over lithium. However, only lithium vs. carbamazepine could be directly compared (in four treatment-arms) meta-analytically in RC patients (RR = 0.93, CI 0.74-1.18, indicating no difference in effectiveness).
   Conclusion: As expected, RC was associated with lower effectiveness of all treatments evaluated. Direct comparisons of specific treatment alternatives for RC patients were rare, and provided no secure evidence of superiority of any treatment. Additional long-term studies comparing RC/non-RC patients randomized to specific treatments are required.

AB  - Major biases and stereotypes in group judgments are reviewed and modeled from a recurrent connectionist perspective. These biases are in areas of group impression formation (illusory correlation), in the group differentiation (accentuation), stereotype change (dispersed vs. concentrated distribution of inconsistent information), and group homogeneity. All these phenomena are illustrated with well-known experiments, and simulated with an autoassociative network architecture with linear activation update and delta learning algorithm for adjusting the connection weights. All the biases were successfully reproduced in the simulations. The discussion centers on how the particular simulation specifications compare with other models of group biases and how they may be used to develop novel hypotheses for testing the connectionist modeling approach and, more generally, for improving theorizing in the field of social biases and stereotype change.

AB  - A large number of physiological variables display 24-h or circadian rhythms. Genes dedicated to the generation and regulation of physiological circadian rhythms have now been identified in several species, including humans. These clock genes are involved in transcriptional regulatory feedback loops. The mutation of these genes in animals leads to abnormal rhythms or even to arrhythmicity in constant conditions. In this view, and given the similarities between the circadian system of humans and rodents, it is expected that mutations of clock genes in humans may give rise to health problems, in particular sleep and mood disorders. Here we first review the present knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythmicity, and we then revisit human circadian rhythm syndromes in light of the molecular data.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this study was to determine risk factors for depression among elderly community subjects.
   Method: MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for potentially relevant articles published from January 1966 to June 2001 and from January 1967 to June 2001, respectively. The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references. Twenty studies met the following six inclusion criteria: original research reported in an English or French publication, study group of community residents, age of subjects 50 years or more, prospective study design, examination of at least one risk factor, and use of an acceptable definition of depression. The validity of studies was assessed according to the four primary criteria for risk factor studies described by the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group. information about group size at baseline and follow-up, age, proportion of men, depression criteria, exclusion criteria at baseline, length of follow-up, number of incident cases of depression, and risk factors was abstracted from each report.
   Results: Follow-up of the inception cohort was incomplete in most studies. In the qualitative meta-analysis, risk factors identified by both univariate and multivariate techniques in at least two studies each were disability, new medical illness, poor health status, prior depression, poor self-perceived health, and bereavement. In the quantitative meta-analysis, bereavement, sleep disturbance, disability, prior depression, and female gender were significant risk factors.
   Conclusions: Despite the methodologic limitations of the studies and this meta-analysis, bereavement, sleep disturbance, disability, prior depression, and female gender appear to be important risk factors for depression among elderly community subjects.

AB  - Many similarities exist between cerebral ischemia and epilepsy regarding brain-damaging and auto-protective mechanisms that are activated following the injurious insult. Therefore, drugs that are effective in minimizing seizure-induced brain damage may also be useful in minimizing ischemic injury. Use of such drugs in stroke victims may have important clinical and financial advantages. Therefore, the authors conducted a Medline search of studies involving the use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as possible neuroprotectants and summarize the data. Most AEDs have been tested in animal models of focal or global ischemia and some were already tested in humans, for a possible neuroprotective effect. The existing data is rather scant and insufficient but it appears that only drugs that have multiple mechanisms of action seem to have some potential in conferring a degree of neuroprotection that could be clinically applicable to stroke patients. In conclusion, some of the newer AEDs show promise as possible neuroprotectants in the setup of acute ischemic stroke but more studies are needed before clinical trials in humans could be undertaken.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this review was to examine the literature assessing the relationship between prenatal exposure to nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and psychosocial stress during pregnancy to the risk of developing behavioral problems related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood.
   Method: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched systematically. Studies using DSM diagnostic criteria and other validated diagnostic or screening instruments for ADHD and those examining ADHD symptoms were included. A narrative approach was used because the studies differed too much in methods and data sources to permit a quantitative meta-analysis.
   Results: Twenty-four studies on nicotine (tobacco smoking), nine on alcohol, one on caffeine, and five on psychosocial stress were identified. All were published between 1973 and 2002. in spite of inconsistencies, the studies on nicotine indicated a greater risk of ADHD-related disorders among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Contradictory findings were reported in the alcohol studies, and no conclusion could be reached on the basis of the caffeine study. Results from studies on psychological stress during pregnancy were inconsistent but indicated a possible modest contribution to ADHD symptoms in the offspring. Many studies suffered from methodological shortcomings, such as recall bias, crude or inaccurate exposure assessments, low statistical power, and lack of or insufficient control of confounders. A general lack of information on familial psychopathology also limited the interpretations.
   Conclusions: Exposure to tobacco smoke in utero is suspected to be associated with ADHD and ADHD symptoms in children. other maternal lifestyle factors during pregnancy may also be associated with these disorders. Further studies are needed to reach conclusions.

AB  - Parkinsonism plus syndrome is a group of heterogeneous degenerative neurological disorders, which differ from the classical idiopathic Parkinson's disease in certain associated clinical features, poor response to levodopa, distinctive pathological characteristics and poor prognosis. Associated clinical features include symmetrical onset, infrequent 1 or atypical tremor, prominent rigidity in axial musculature, bradykinesia, early postural instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, early autonomic failure, pyramidal affection, cerebellar involvement, alien limb phenomenon, apraxia and significant early cognitive dysfunction in some cases. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB) are commoner disorders. Less frequent disorders are cortico-based ganglionic degeneration (CBGD), frontotemporal dementia with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) Pick's disease parkinsonian -dementia complex of Guam, Pallidonigral degeneration, Wilson's disease and a rigid variant of Huntington's disease. During the last 3 decades, major progress has been made in understanding PSP, CBGD and FTDP-17, which are tau disorders. MSA and DLB together with idiopathic Parkinson's disease are called a synucleinopathies. Recent studies show that the diagnosis of these Parkinsonism plus syndromes improves when strict diagnostic criteria are used. However, unusual presentations may pose a diagnostic challenge. The shortcomings of the current studies demand the need for further research to identify biologic markers that may allow earlier diagnosis, and understanding of the factors leading to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregation. Identification of therapeutic strategies that may prevent the aggregation of these proteins and rescue dysfunctional cells has been stressed. This review focuses on the advances in the clinical, neuroimaging, pathologic, genetic and management aspects of these disorders.

AB  - Objective: Restraint use is not monitored in the US, and only institutions that choose to do so collect statistics. In 1999, investigative journalists reported lethal consequences proximal to restraint use, making it a life-and-death matter that demands attention from professionals. This paper reviews the literature concerning actual and potential causes of deaths proximal to the use of physical restraint.
   Method: Searching the electronic databases Medline, Cinahl, and PsycINFO, we reviewed the areas of forensics and pathology, nursing, cardiology, immunology, psychology, neurosciences, psychiatry, emergency medicine, and sports medicine.
   Conclusions: Research is needed to provide clinicians with data on the risk factors and adverse effects associated with restraint use, as well as data on procedures that will lead to reduced use. Research is needed to determine what individual risk factors and combinations thereof contribute to injury and death.

AB  - Clinicians and investigators have sought better means of matching patients to treatments since the advent of modern psychopharmacology. Attempts to use clinical features to predict which patients will respond to specific medications have met with limited success (see article by Nierenberg in this issue). Researchers also have sought biological tests that might discriminate between likely treatment responders and nonresponders or identify those at greater risk for relapse. Investigating techniques have ranged from urine neurotransmitter metabolites to electroencephalogram (EEG). Most recently, the widespread availability of neuroimaging technology has led to new efforts to apply these techniques to predict treatment response in psychiatry.
   The search for response predictors is driven by two related goals. The first is identifying the underlying pathophysiology associated with a given disease. Just as the utility of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in major depression provided evidence for serotonergic dysregulation in some affective illnesses, the discovery that changes in the metabolism of certain brain regions predict treatment response would implicate those structures in the process of disease development or recovery. These findings could guide future drug development.
   A second goal is to allow more targeted and focused clinical interventions. For example, while first-line antidepressant treatments have response rates of 50% or more, many patients still fail to respond to multiple interventions [1,2]. As each new pharmacotherapy is tried, patients are exposed to additional cost, adverse effect burden, and the potential for loss of function and suicide.
   Importantly, these two goals imply different criteria for what makes a response predictor useful. From a research perspective, identifying any association would be valuable in guiding future studies. From a clinical perspective, however, the requirements are more stringent and rarely have been achieved. Such factors as positive and negative predictive value and cost and availability of technology become critical in determining the utility of a predictive test (see article by Nierenberg in this issue). Attempts to identify biological response predictors generally have met with limited success, particularly where the goal is to develop clinically useful indices. This article reviews the biological approaches to predicting treatment response, beginning with neuroendocrine studies and EEG analysis and concludes with structural and functional neuroimaging. Where relevant, the authors identify studies correlating change in a measure during treatment; though these studies identify correlates of response rather than true predictors, they also may point the way to useful predictive measures. The article describes the designs of typical studies to aid in interpreting their results and concludes by addressing some of the problems and limitations associated with these approaches and suggesting future directions for this research.
   Original reports or reviews included in this article were identified by conducting a MEDLINE search with the terms "response," "predictor," and "treatment," combined with "depression," "bipolar disorder," or "affective illness." References in the publications identified were reviewed manually to locate additional relevant publications. Of note, pharmacogenomics, which shows great promise for response prediction in psychiatry, is discussed elsewhere (see article by Pickar in this issue).

AB  - Pelagic rotifers were studied in lakes with contrasting acidification histories situated in an acid-stressed region of southern Norway. Life histories and spatial distribution varied considerably between the investigated species, and influenced the recovery processes. Most headwater lakes have experienced strongly acidified environments during the last five decades, whereas lakes close to the Skagerrak coast have been stable within the same period. Rotifer diversity and abundance were reduced in the most acidic sites and increased towards the coast. Most surveyed species are known to possess sediment egg-banks, and after chemical recovery most rotifers dispersed into the plankton from these egg-banks and produced viable populations. Some species of the genera Polyarthra and Collotheca, and the species Kellicotta longispina and Keratella serrulata showed a striking ability to tolerate acidification, and were the dominant taxa in the acidmost environments. K. serrulata characterised, but did not numerically dominate, acid rotifer communities especially in the most coloured sites, and decreased following liming. The predominantly bacteriophageous genus Conochilus exploded in numbers shortly after liming, most probably because bacteria increased strongly during this transition phase. Planktivorous fish influenced indirectly rotifer abundance by consuming invertebrate predators and important rotifer competitors such as filter feeding cladocerans. Invertebrate predators, such as larvae of Chaoborus spp. and Heterocope saliens probably influenced rotifer distributional patterns in a complex top- down manner, both during chronic acidification and liming in environments with low fish predation. Important rotifer predators such as pelagic cyclopoid copepods, Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindti, were absent from the most acidic fishless lakes. Considerable populations of large-sized Daphnia longispina probably suppressed several rotifer species in sites with low fish predation, as did large populations of Bosmina longispina and Ceriodaphina quadrangula in lakes with intense fish predation.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically examine ancient Roman and Greek texts to identify descriptions of schizophrenia and related disorders.
   Method: Material from Greek and Roman literature dating from the 5th Century BC to the beginning of the 2nd Century AD was systematically reviewed for symptoms of mental illness. DSM IV criteria were applied in order to identify material related to schizophrenia and related disorders.
   Results: The general public had an awareness of psychotic disorders, because the symptoms were described in works of fiction and in historical accounts of malingering. There were isolated instances of text related to psychotic symptoms in the residents of ancient Rome and Greece, but no written material describing a condition that would meet modern diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: In contrast to many other psychiatric disorders that are represented in ancient Greek and Roman literature, there were no descriptions of individuals with schizophrenia in the material assessed in this review.

AB  - Objectives: This study attempts to assess the evidence of the generally recommended three-step programme of skin protection in the prevention of occupational skin disease. Methods: The following clinical questions, representative of critical appraisal of this preventive measurement, were generated: (1) Can a skincare regimen effectively reduce or eliminate work-related poor skin conditions? (2) Do protective creams prevent harmful substances from penetrating and adhering to the skin? (3) Is the differentiation between pre-exposure and post-exposure products justified by reliable data? Answers were generated according to the method used in evidence-based medicine by searching the literature, critically appraising the results and applying the results to the clinical questions. For our search we decided to use PubMed as the most convenient access to Medline and because, in contrast to other databases, this access is available free of charge. Results: To investigate the efficacy of barrier creams as pre-exposure skin protectors various in vitro and in vivo test methods have been developed. Over the past years the test techniques have been improved in order to adopt a real workplace situation. Efforts for standardisation of evaluation criteria have been made, too. Nevertheless, there is a lack of placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials evaluating the benefit of these products in the prevention of occupational contact dermatitis under real workplace conditions. The literature data are conflicting; some publications report on the positive aspects of skin protection, whereas others stress the negative ones. Conclusion: Not enough data have been accumulated for one to prove the benefit of skin protection measures under real workplace condition. Up to now, it is almost unclear if the various in vitro and in vivo methods used are suitable to simulate real workplace conditions and if these test results can be related to real occupational exposure. For the evidence-based recommendation of skin protection, further studies, especially under daily working conditions evaluating the contribution of each single element of skincare programme (products, frequency of application and education programme) are needed.

AB  - Biological invasions in marine environment are the lesser known aspect of global change. However, recent events which occurred in the Mediterranean Sea demonstrate that they represent a serious ecological and economical menace leading to biodiversity loss, ecosystem unbalancing, fishery and tourism impairment. In this paper we review marine bioinvasions using examples taken from the Mediterranean/Black Sea region. Particular attention is given to the environmental status of the receiving area as a fundamental prerequisite for the colonisation success of alien species. The spread of the tropical algae belonging to the genus Caulerpa in the northwestern basin of the Mediterranean Sea has been facilitated by pre-existing conditions of instability of the Posidonia oceanica endemic ecosystem in relation to stress of both natural and anthropogenic origin. Human interventions caused long-term modification in the Black Sea environment, preparing a fertile ground for mass bloinvasion of aquatic nuisance species which, in some cases, altered the original equilibrium of the entire basin. Finally, the Venice lagoon is presented as the third example of an environment subjected to high propagule pressure and anthropogenic forcing and bearing the higher "diversity" of non-indigenous species compared to the other Mediterranean lagoons. Stressed environments are easily colonised by alien species; understanding the links between human and natural disturbance and massive development of non-indigenous species will help prevent marine bioinvasions, that are already favoured by global oceanic trade.

AB  - Objective: The study of social cognition in schizophrenia has received growing attention in recent years. At the same time, a large body of work has explored the neural basis of social cognition in both nonclinical and clinical groups, other than those with schizophrenia. The gap between these two literatures is considerable and may slow progress in creating a comprehensive social cognitive model of schizophrenia. This article attempts to bridge this gap by discussing how the neural basis of social cognition may inform future clinical research in schizophrenia.
   Method: PsycINFO and MEDLINE were systematically searched for articles pertaining to the neural basis of social cognition and social cognition in schizophrenia. Relevant studies were obtained and synthesized into a comprehensive review and integrative formulation.
   Results: Striking parallels between these two areas of research were found.
   Conclusions: These parallels might help to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms for social cognitive and social behavioral impairments in schizophrenia as well as provide potential targets for treatment and drug development.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder is particularly frequent among physically ill inpatients. Despite the considerable human burden and financial costs, Major Depressive Disorder remains under-detected and under-treated. To improve this situation, clinical practice guidelines for the management of Major Depressive Disorder were developed for patients in the general hospital. They were adapted from existing good quality guidelines. A literature search has been conducted to identify guidelines and systematic reviews about the management of Major Depressive Disorder. The quality of the existing guidelines was evaluated by means of the AGREE instrument (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation). Complementary literature searches were necessary to answer questions such as "depression and physical illness" or "antidepressants and somatic medication". The guidelines were discussed by a multidisciplinary internal panel. The final version was reviewed by an external panel. This paper presents the development process and a summary of these guidelines for the management of Major Depressive Disorder. The adaptation of good quality guidelines to local needs requires much time, effort and skills. Easier ways for the adaptation and use of high quality guidelines at the local level may result from better coordination, organization and updating of guidelines at a national or supranational level.

AB  - Remembering is the ability to bring back to mind episodes from one's past and is presumably accomplished by multiple, interdependent processes. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, neural correlates of three hypothesized components of remembering were explored, including those associated with control, perceived oldness, and retrieved content. Levels of each component were separately manipulated by varying study procedures and sorting trials by subject response. Results suggest that specific regions in the left prefrontal cortex, including anterior-ventral Brodmann's Area ( BA) 45/47 and more dorsal BA 44, increase activity when high levels of control are required but do not necessarily modulate on the basis of perceived oldness. Parietal and frontal regions, particularly the left parietal cortex near BA 40/39, associate with the perception that information is old and generalize across levels of control and retrieved content. Activity in the parietal cortex correlated with perceived oldness even when judgments were in error. The inferior temporal cortex near BA 19/37 associated differentially with retrieval of visual object content. Within the ventral visual processing stream, content-based modulation was specific to late object-responsive regions, suggesting an efficient retrieval process that spares areas that process more primitive retinotopically mapped visual features. Taken collectively, the results identify neural correlates of distinct components of remembering and provide evidence for a functional dissociation. Frontal regions may contribute to control processes that interact with different posterior regions that contribute a signal that information is old and support the contents of retrieval.

AB  - Objective: To review the efficacy of antenatal group interventions aimed at reducing postnatal depression (PND) in 'at risk' women.
   Method: Medline, Psyclit, HEALTHSTAR, EMBASE, Cochrane library, UK National Research Register and CINHAL searches were performed from 1960 to December 2001 focussing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
   Results: As statistical synthesis of the studies was not feasible, a qualitative review is provided. All five studies reviewed suffer from substantial limitations including small numbers; unrealistic effect sizes; large attrition rates; lack of a systematic approach in identifying those 'at risk' and thus clinically heterogenous samples. Three of the studies used unvalidated interventions that were educational or supportive in approach. While one such study reported a benefit of intervention, the largest study using a structured intervention, reported no effect. A very small study using interpersonal therapy, was promising but needs replication with an adequate sample size.
   Conclusion: There is currently little evidence from RCTs to support the implementation of antenatal group interventions to reduce PND in 'at risk' women. Further studies addressing the significant methodological limitations are recommended before concluding that antenatal targeted interventions have no place in maternity care.

AB  - The idea of 'disease entity' in psychiatry and the nosologic map of insanity with the distinction between dementia praecox (schizophrenia since Bleuler 1911) and manic depressive insanity, originally developed by Emil Kraepelin (1896), is an important landmark in the history of psychiatry (Jablensky 1995). This classification, however, has been vigorously debated throughout the years, and new evidence emerging from epidemiological, clinical, genetic and biological research demonstrates that the two nosological categories have distinct features as well as share many similarities in their risk factors, genetic predisposition, brain pathology, neurophysiology, clinical phenomenology and response to treatment, thus raising questions about the validity of the categorical classification of psychoses.
   In this paper we examine some of the similarities and differences between schizophrenia and bipolar illness emerging from recent biological and clinical research and attempt to clarify major inherent logical contradictions in the application of the 'disease' model of psychiatric diagnosis to the categorical classification of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. Then we examine how similar predicaments have been resolved in other natural classiflcation systems, namely the biological classiflcation of species and the periodic table of the elements. Finally we propose a hypothetical conceptual approach to the classiflcation of psychoses that has been greatly informed by the organizing principle underlying the periodic table of the elements, and is distinct from the 'disease' model of psychiatric classiflcation.

AB  - Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells.

AB  - Responses of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes to nutrients and trace elements were examined in a series of experimental estuarine food webs of increasing trophic complexity using twenty 1-m(3) mesocosms. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and trace elements (a mix of arsenic, copper, cadmium) were added alone and in combination during four experimental runs spanning from spring 1997 to spring 1998. Diel changes in dissolved oxygen were used to examine whole system gross primary production (WS-GPP), respiration (WS-RESP), and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM). Nutrient and trace element additions had the greatest effect on WS-GPP, WS-RESP, and NEM; trophic complexity did not significantly affect any of these parameters (p > 0.3). Effects of trophic complexity were detected in nutrient tanks where bivalves significantly (p = 0.03) reduced WS-GPP. Nutrient additions significantly enhanced WS-GPP and to a lesser extent WS-RESP during most mesocosm runs. The system shifted from net heterotrophy (-17.2 +/- 1.8 mmol C m(-3) d(-1)) in the controls to net autotrophy (29.1 +/- 7.6 mmol C m(-3) d(-1)) in the nutrient tanks. The addition of trace elements alone did not affect WS-GPP and WS-RESP to the same extent as nutrients, and their effects were more variable. Additions of trace elements alone consistently made the system more net heterotrophic (-24.9 +/- 1.4 mmol C m(-3) d(-1)) than the controls. When trace elements were added in combination with nutrients, the nutrient-enriched system became less autotrophic (1.6 +/- 3.1 mmol C m(-3) d(-1)). The effects of trace elements on NEM occurred primarily through reductions in WS-GPP rather than increases in WS-RESP. Our results suggest that autotrophic and heterotrophic processes respond differently to these stressors.

AB  - As the field of mental health increasingly turns its attention to spirituality, Christian counseling is busily investigating how spiritual formation relates to psychotherapy. At the heart of these concerns is the topic of the human soul. This article explores the meaning of "soul" in Scripture, in Greek philosophy, and in medieval spirituality as it impacts the present practice of psychotherapy, an enterprise that primarily deals with the self. Particular attention is given to the knowledge competencies regarding the soul that Christian counselors will need as they re-tool for adding spiritual formation to their counseling practices.

AB  - As an explicit organizing metaphor, memory aid, and conceptual framework, the prefrontal. cortex may be viewed as a five-member 'Executive Committee,' as the prefrontal-control extensions of five sub-and-posterior-cortical systems: (1) the 'Perceiver' (dominant-right-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex-VL/PERC-PFC) is the frontal extension of the ventral perceptual stream (the VL/PERC system) which represents the world and self in object coordinates; (2) the 'Verbalizer' (dominant-left-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex system-VL/VERB-PFC) is the frontal extension of the language stream (the VL/VERB system) which represents the world and self in language coordinates; (3) the 'Motivator' (ventral/medial-orbital pre-frontal cortex-VMO-PFC) is the frontal cortical extension of a subcortical extended-amygdala stream (the VMO system) which represents the world and self in motivational/emotional coordinates; (4) the 'Attender' (dorsal-medial/anterior cingulate-DM/AC-PFC) is the frontal cortical extension of a subcortical extended-hippocampal stream (the DM/AC system) which represents the world and self in spatiotemporal coordinates and directs attention to internal and external events; and (5) the 'Coordinator' (the dorsolateral. prefrontal cortex-DL-PFC) is the frontal extension of the dorsal perceptual stream (the DL system) which represents the world and self in body- and eye-coordinates and controls willed action and working memory. This tutorial review examines the interacting roles of these five systems in perception, working memory, attention, long-term memory, motor control, and thinking. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - Objectives: Treatment resistant depression (TRD), commonly encountered in clinical practice, leads to socioeconomic disability and therapeutic pessimism. This paper reviews evidence for pharmacological approaches used in TRD.
   Method: Electronic literature searches were performed using Medline and Psychlit using broad search terms relating to TRID.
   Results: Agents that potentiate both serotonin and noradrenaline may allow more patients to achieve full remission. Attention must be paid to dose titration and length of treatment courses in TRD. Augmentation with lithium and switching within antidepressant class or between classes can often improve symptoms but efficacy of other augmentation approaches remains uncertain. Antidepressant combinations and addition of atypical antipsychotics can be useful but combinations of predominantly serotonergic antidepressants should be avoided. Electroconvulsive therapy retains an important role in TRD but pharmacological treatments need to be continued concomitantly.
   Conclusions: Good improvement is seen in TRD after vigorous antidepressant treatment but most patients continue to have lower grade symptomatology.

AB  - Folate is a cofactor in one-carbon metabolism, during which it promotes the remethylation of homocysteine-a cytotoxic sulfur-containing amino acid that can induce DNA strand breakage, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Dietary folate is required for normal development of the nervous system, playing important roles regulating neurogenesis and programmed cell death. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies have linked folate deficiency and resultant increased homocysteine levels with several neurodegenerative conditions, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, genetic and clinical data suggest roles for folate and homocysteine in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the roles of folate and homocysteine in neuronal homeostasis throughout life is revealing novel approaches for preventing and treating neurological disorders.

AB  - Purpose of review Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects nearly 1% of the general population and has long been a challenge for both clinicians and researchers in terms of treatment and etiology. More recently, evidence has amassed that suggests that schizophrenia is a brain disorder, and that some aspects of this disorder appear to be genetic. It has only been in the past decade, however, that adequate neuroimaging tools have become available to study brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. These technologic advances have led to a much better understanding of both structural and functional brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, and allowed construction of comprehensive theories regarding the neural underpinnings of schizophrenia. The present review provides an account of research activities in the fields of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging during the past year, dating from August 2001 to August 2002.
   Recent findings In the review we discuss MRI findings in chronic schizophrenia and in first episode schizophrenia, and we include information on family studies. We note that the two major hypotheses regarding schizophrenia (neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative) provide a theoretical framework for most studies. For the functional MRI studies, we note that questions focus on identifying networks of brain regions that are abnormal and contribute to functional abnormalities.
   Summary Jointly, MRI, functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging research suggests that schizophrenia is a disorder that impacts on several brain regions, leading most notably to abnormalities in both frontal and temporal lobes, as well as to abnormal connections between those two major structures.

AB  - A high resolution PHAL analysis of axonal connections suggests the existence of a visceromotor pattern generator network in the periventricular region of the rat hypothalamus (HVPG), and a preliminary account of its structure is provided here. Six nodes identified thus far include the dorsomedial nucleus and five small nuclei in the preoptic region (anteroventral and anterodorsal preoptic, parastrial, median preoptic, and anteroventral periventricular). Aside from its location between the neuroendocrine motor zone and the medial hypothalamic nuclei (behavior control column), three other primary features characterize the HVPG network. First, each HVPG nucleus generates a pattern of terminal fields that differentially targets a unique set of hypothalamic neuroendocrine motoneuron pools, and of preautonomic parts of the paraventricular nucleus. Second, the six HVPG nuclei are massively interconnected themselves. And third, the majority of projections from the HVPG nuclei remain within the medial half of the hypothalamus; additional outputs reach the septum, other parts of the diencephalon, and the brainstern central gray. Possible control of activity in the HVPG by neural inputs from the cerebral hemispheres, sensory systems, behavioral state-related cell groups, and the hypothalamic behavior or motivation control column is discussed, along with certain key functional data related to HVPG nuclei. Finally, the HVPG is incorporated into a working model of hypothalamic organization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To describe what is known of quality of life for colorectal cancer patients, to review what has been done in the Australian setting and to identify emerging directions for future research to address current gaps in knowledge.
   Method: A literature search (using Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts) was conducted and 41 articles identified for review.
   Results: Three key areas relating to quality of life in colorectal cancer patients emerged from the literature review: the definition and measurement of quality of life; predictors of quality of life; and the relationship of quality of life to survival. Results of existing studies are inconsistent in relation to quality of life over time and its relationship to survival. Small sample sizes and methodological limitations make interpretation difficult.
   Conclusions: There is a need for large-scale, longitudinal, population-based studies describing the quality of life experienced by colorectal cancer patients and its determinants. Measurement and simultaneous adjustment for potential confounding factors would productively advance knowledge in this area, as would an analysis of the economic cost of morbidity to the community and an assessment of the cost effectiveness of proposed interventions. Implications: As the Australian population ages, the prevalence of colorectal cancer within the community will increase. This burden of disease presents as a priority area for public health research. An improved understanding of quality of life and its predictors will inform the development and design of supportive interventions for those affected by the disease.

TI  - Neuroethics: an agenda for neuroscience and society
AB  - The last decades of the twentieth century saw the rise of modern genetics. Now, many regard the initial decades of the twenty-first century as an era that promises explosive growth in our knowledge of the brain. Just as ethical issues have been a part of discourse in genetics from the outset, we are now paying attention to ethics in neuroscience. But whereas the ethics of genetics was in many ways a new conversation, the philosophical discussion of mental function and behaviour is an ancient tradition that both informs and complicates the emerging field of neuroethics.

AB  - Recent lattice calculations have demonstrated that the QCD static potential for sources in different representations of the gauge group is proportional to the eigenvalue of the corresponding quadratic Casimir operator with an accuracy of a few percent. We discuss the present theoretical status of this "Casimir scaling" phenomenon and stress its importance for the analysis of nonperturbative QCD vacuum models and other field theories. It is argued that Casimir scaling strongly advocates the property of Gaussian dominance of nonperturbative QCD vacuum. We also briefly discuss possible future tests to improve our understanding of the phenomenon.

AB  - The magnetic iron garnets possess two outstanding properties, an excellently narrow linewidth of the ferromagnetic resonance and a magneto-optical activity that is without competition when the iron garnet is substituted with bismuth. Here the growth of bismuth substituted iron garnet layers with a bismuth content of up to 1.8 formula units is reported. The influence of solution compositions and undercooling on the growth and bismuth incorporation is discussed. Morphological instabilities due to misfit stress are avoided by the use of lattice-matched substrates. Two applications of iron garnet layers, namely a electronically controllable magnetostatic delay line for the communication technology in the GHz range and magneto-optic garnet sensor layers for real-time visualisation of eddy currents with high spatial resolution for the non-destructive evaluation are presented. Furthermore the detection, measurement, and visualisation of magnetic fields by magneto-optic garnet layers are reviewed.

AB  - The mode of action of the antipsychotic drugs clozapine, haloperidol and iloperidone was investigated in layer V of prefrontal cortex slices using extracellular field potential, intracellular sharp-electrode as well as whole-cell voltage clamp recording techniques. Intracellular investigations on a broad range of concentrations I revealed that the typical neuroleptic haloperidol at higher concentrations significantly depressed the excitatory postsynaptic component induced by electrical stimulation of layer II. This was not seen with the atypical neuroleptics clozapine and iloperidone. None of the three compounds had any effect on the resting membrane potential, spike amplitude or input resistance at relevant concentrations. Synaptic plasticity was assessed by means of extracellular field potential recordings. Clozapine significantly facilitated the potentiation of synaptic transmission, whereas haloperidol and iloperidone showed no effects. In line with its facilitating effect on synaptic plasticity, it could be demonstrated by whole-cell voltage clamp recordings that clozapine increased N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in the majority of prefrontal cortical neurones. These investigations were made with neuroleptic drugs applied to the bath in the micromolar concentration range in order to approach clinical brain concentrations that are reached after administration of therapeutic doses. The drug concentrations reached in the slices after the experiments were assessed by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometric detection. Surprisingly, drug accumulation in the in vitro preparation was of similar degree as reported in vivo.
   In conclusion, the typical neuroleptic haloperidol significantly depressed excitatory synaptic transmission in layer V neurones of the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the two atypical neuroleptics, iloperidone and clozapine revealed no depressing effects. This feature of the atypical neuroleptics might be beneficial since a hypofunctionality of this brain area is thought to be linked with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Additionally, clozapine facilitated long-term potentiation, which might be linked with the clinically observed beneficial effects on certain cognitive parameters. The clozapine-induced increase of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor-mediated currents suggests that clozapine facilitates the, induction of long-term potentiation. Furthermore, the present study points to the importance of considering the significant accumulation of neuroleptic drugs in in vitro studies. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Their purpose is to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence pertaining to the treatment of acute mania. The data used for these guidelines have been extracted from a MEDLINE and EMBASE search, from recent proceedings of key conferences, and from various national and international treatment guidelines. Their scientific rigor was categorised into four levels of evidence (A-D). As these guidelines are intended for clinical use, the scientific evidence was finally not only graded, but has also been commented by the experts of the task force to ensure practicability.

AB  - Behavioral studies on gene-manipulated mice have started to elucidate the neurobiological functions of the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor (AR) subtype. In this study, we applied quantitative receptor autoradiography to investigate the potential anatomical correlates of the observed functional effects of altered alpha(2C)-AR expression. Labeling of brain and spinal cord sections with the subtype non-selective alpha(2)-AR radioligand [H-3]RX821002 and the alpha(2C)-AR-preferring ligand [3 H]rauwolscine revealed distinct binding-site distribution patterns. In control mice, [H-3]rauwolscine binding was most abundant in the olfactory tubercle, accumbens and caudate putamen nuclei, and in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. A mouse strain with overexpression of alpha(2C)-AR regulated by a gene-specific promoter showed approximately two- to fourfold increased levels of [H-3]rauwolscine binding in these regions. In addition, dramatic increases in [3 H]rauwolscine binding were seen in the nerve layer of the olfactory bulb, the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and the ventricular system of of alpha(2C)-AR-overexpressing mice, representing "ectopic" a2C-AR expression. Competition-binding experiments with several alpha(2)-AR ligands confirmed the alpha(2C)-AR identity of these sites. Our results provide quantitative evidence of the predominance of the alpha(2A)-AR subtype in most regions of the mouse CNS, but also disclose the wide distribution of alpha(2C)-AR in the normal mouse brain, although at relatively low density, except in the ventral and dorsal striatum and the hippocampal CA1 area. alpha(2C)-AR are thus present in brain regions involved in the processing of sensory information and in the control of motor and emotion-related activities such as the accumbens and caudate putamen nuclei, the olfactory tubercle, the lateral septum, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the frontal and somatosensory cortices.
   The current results may help in specifying an anatomical framework for the functional roles of the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-AR subtypes in the mouse CNS. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Screening for vulnerability to psychological disorders in the military: an historical survey
KW  - BATTLE
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate attempts in the military to screen for vulnerability to psychological disorders from World War I to the present.
   Methods: An extensive literature review was conducted by hand-searching leading medical and psychological journals relating to World Wars I and II. Recent publications were surveyed electronically and UK archives investigated for British applications.
   Results: Despite the optimism shown in World War I and the concerted efforts of World War II, follow-up studies showed that screening programmes did not succeed in reducing the incidence of psychological casualties. Furthermore, they had a counter-productive effect on manpower, often rejecting men who would have made good soldiers. Continued experimentation with screening methods for psychiatric vulnerability failed to yield convincing results during the post-war period.
   Conclusions: Although well-measured variables, such as intelligence, have been shown to predict success in training and aptitude, no instrument has yet been identified which can accurately assess psychological vulnerability. Previous attempts have failed because of false-positives, false-negatives and reluctance in the target population because of stigma. Early findings suggest that psychological surveillance, surveillance, if not screening, may yield valuable results when applied to military populations exposed to stress.

AB  - The present paper reviews studies examining the effects of non-pharmacological stimulation, i.e. bright light, physical activity and tactile stimulation (touch), on cognition, affective behaviour, and the sleep-wake rhythm of impaired and demented elderly, both in a qualitative (narrative) and quantitative (meta-analytic) manner. An extensive search through eight bibliographic data bases (PubMed, Web of Science, ERIC, PsychINFO, Psyndex, Cinahl, Biological Abstracts and Rehabdata) was performed up to August 2002. The primary criterion for inclusion in this review was that studies provided sufficient data to calculate effect-sizes. In the qualitative analysis, all three types of stimulation appeared to improve cognitive functioning. Disturbances in behaviour react positively to bright light and tactile stimulation. Bright light was also beneficial to sleep. Tactile stimulation had, moreover, a beneficial influence on the patient-caretaker relationship. A comparison was made with several representative papers published since 1991 on the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition and behaviour with representative papers on non-pharmacological stimulation interventions. Data indicated that improvements in cognition and affective behaviour by non-pharmacological interventions (d' = 0.32) and by cholinesterase inhibitors (d' = 0.31) were of similar effect-size. Possible mechanisms underlying the non-pharmacological stimulation effects are discussed and suggestions offered for future research.

AB  - Aggregation of abnormal proteins, both inside and outside of cells, is a prominent feature of major neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, polyglutamine expansion, and prion diseases. Other articles in this special issue of NeuroMolecular Medicine describe the genetic and molecular factors that promote aberrant protein aggregation. In the present article, we consider how it is that pathogenic aggregation-prone proteins compromise signal transduction pathways that regulate neuronal plasticity and survival. In some cases the protein in question may have widespread and relatively nonspecific effects on signaling. For example, amyloid beta-peptide induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, which impairs the function of various receptors, ion channels and transporters, as well as downstream kinases and transcription factors. Other proteins, such as polyglutamine repeat proteins, may affect specific protein-protein interactions, including those involved in signaling pathways activated by neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and steroid hormones. Synapses are particularly sensitive to abnormal protein aggregation and impaired synaptic signaling may trigger apoptosis and related cell death cascades. Impairment of signal transduction in protein aggregation disorders may be amenable to therapy as demonstrated by a recent study showing that dietary restriction can preserve synaptic function and protect neurons in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Finally, emerging findings are revealing how activation of certain signaling pathways can suppress protein aggregation and/or the cytotoxicity resulting from the abnormal protein aggregation. A better understanding of how abnormal protein aggregation occurs and how it affects and is affected by specific signal transduction pathways, is leading to novel approaches for preventing and treating neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Activation of glutamate receptors can trigger the death of neurons and some types of glial cells, particularly when the cells are coincidentally subjected to adverse conditions such as reduced levels of oxygen or glucose, increased levels of oxidative stress, exposure to toxins or other pathogenic agents, or a disease-causing genetic mutation. Such excitotoxic cell death involves excessive calcium influx and release from internal organelles, oxyradical production, and engagement of programmed cell death (apoptosis) cascades. Apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bax, and Par-4 induce mitochondrial membrane permeability changes resulting in the release of cytochrome c and the activation of proteases, such as caspase-3. Events occurring at several subcellular sites, including the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and nucleus play important roles in excitotoxicity. Excitotoxic cascades are initiated in postsynaptic dendrites and may either cause local degeneration or plasticity of those synapses, or may propagate the signals to the cell body resulting in cell death. Cells possess an array of anti-excitotoxic mechanisms including neurotrophic signaling pathways, intrinsic stress-response pathways, and survival proteins such as protein chaperones, calcium-binding proteins, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Considerable evidence supports roles for excitotoxicity in acute disorders such as epileptic seizures, stroke and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, as well as in chronic age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A better understanding of the excitotoxic process is not only leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders, but also to unexpected insight into mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The investigation of spiritual/religious factors in health is clearly warranted and clinically relevant. This special section explores the persistent predictive relationship between religious variables and health, and its implications for future research and practice. The section reviews epidemiological evidence linking religiousness to morbidity and mortality, possible biological pathways linking spirituality/ religiousness to health, and advances in the assessment of spiritual/religious variables in research and practice. This introduction provides an overview of this field of research and addresses 3 related methodological issues: definitions of terms, approaches to statistical control, and criteria used to judge the level of supporting evidence for specific hypotheses. The study of spirituality and health is a true frontier for psychology and one with high public interest.

AB  - Because the processing capacity of the visual system is limited, selective attention to one part of the visual field comes at the cost of neglecting other parts. In this paper, we review evidence from single-cell studies in monkeys and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans for neural competition and how competition is biased by, attention. We Suggest that, at the neural level, an important consequence of attention is to enhance the influence of behaviorally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant ones, providing a mechanism for the filtering of distracting information in Cluttered visual scenes. Psychophysical evidence suggests that processing outside the focus of attention is attenuated and may be even eliminated under some conditions. A major exception to the critical role of attention may be in the neural processing of emotion-laden stimuli, which are reported to be processed automatically, namely. without attention. Contrary to this prevailing view, in a recent study we found that all brain regions responding differentially to faces with emotional content, including the amygdala, did so only when sufficient resources were available to process those faces. After reviewing our findings, we discuss their implications, in particular (1) how emotional stimuli can bias competition for processing resources; (2) the source of the biasing signal for emotional stimuli: (3) how Visual information reaches the amygdala; and finally (4) the relationship between attention and awareness.

AB  - Laboratory conditions in biobehavioral experiments are commonly assumed to be 'controlled', having little impact on the outcome. However, recent studies have illustrated that the laboratory environment has a robust effect on behavioral traits. Given that environmental factors can interact with trait-relevant genes, some have questioned the reliability and generalizability of behavior genetic research designed to identify those genes. This problem might be alleviated by the identification of the most relevant environmental factors, but the task is hindered by the large number of factors that typically vary between and within laboratories. We used a computational approach to retrospectively identify and rank sources of variability in nociceptive responses as they occurred in a typical research laboratory over several years. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to an archival data set of 8034 independent observations of baseline thermal nociceptive sensitivity. This analysis revealed that a factor even more important than mouse genotype was the experimenter performing the test, and that nociception can be affected by many additional laboratory factors including season/humidity, cage density, time of day, sex and within-cage order of testing. The results were confirmed by linear modeling in a subset of the data, and in confirmatory experiments, in which we were able to partition the variance of this complex trait among genetic (27%), environmental (42%) and genetic X environmental (18%) sources.

AB  - We compared the performance in a picture-name matching task of 10 patients suffering from left cerebral hemisphere (LH) damage and 10 from right hemisphere (RH) damage. The tasks showed detailed figures of nonrigid objects (animals) and rigid objects (artefacts), and each object was shown in two separate views: a noncanonical view (an unusual perspective for rigid objects or a contorted pose for the nonrigid ones) and a canonical view (a typical perspective and pose). Patients with LH damage were specifically impaired in identifying noncanonical (contorted) poses of nonrigid objects (animals). In a second picture-name matching experiment, using the divided visual field technique, normal subjects matched names to images of nonrigid shapes (animals) shown in canonical and noncanonical perspectives of noncontorted, typical poses of the animals. It was found that the normal subjects' RH identified these perspectives better than their LH. We conclude that computationally different problems are solved by different cerebral mechanisms when identifying flexible objects and when identifying rigid objects. We propose the idea that identifying flexible objects when their shapes contort relies on accessing stored descriptions of objects' parts and their "categorical" spatial relations and that both types of information are encoded better by the LH. In contrast, we propose that the RH is more adept at identifying different perspectives of rigid objects (and flexible objects when their shapes do not contort) because of this hemisphere's superiority in encoding specific global shapes and their views, and in coordinate spatial transformation.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a devastating neurological condition that affects at least four million people. A striking feature of this disorder is the preferential loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain. Several aetiological triggers have been linked to Parkinson's disease, including genetic mutations and environmental toxins, but the pathway that leads to cell death is unknown. Recent developments have shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the degeneration of these cells. We propose that defective sequestration of dopamine into vesicles, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species in the cytoplasm, is a key event in the demise of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, and might represent a common pathway that underlies both genetic and sporadic forms of the disorder.

AB  - Online response preparation was assessed in a visual search task using rapid serial visual presentation. In each trial, a series of letters was presented sequentially, and participants were instructed to make a target-present response if a prespecified target letter was presented or a target-absent response if it was not. Measurements of response preparation using both probe reaction time and the lateralized readiness potential indicated that preparation of the target-absent response increased near the end of the sequence. Most of the increase appeared to be due to direct priming of the target-absent response by nontarget letters, but part was due to the increased conditional probability of this response near the end of the sequence. These results extend previous studies of response preparation by showing online response preparation during a temporally extended reaction time task.

AB  - Psychological literature on trauma usually focuses on pathology that results from trauma and pays little attention to positive outcomes. This article presents a phenomenological inquiry into the experiences of a profoundly traumatized group of people-parents whose son or daughter has been murdered-to assess if they were able to experience a positive outcome resulting from their trauma and to identify associated processes and resources. Of 65 parents who volunteered, 16 were selected to complete a questionnaire and were given in-depth, semistructured. interviews-The interview data, analyzed qualitatively, affirm positive outcomes for these parents. Four processes-acceptance, finding meaning, personal decision making, and reaching out to others in compassion-and six resources-personal qualities, spirituality, continuing bond with the victim, social support, previous coping experience, and self-care-facilitate a positive outcome.

AB  - The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by mask stimuli that do not elicit responses if presented alone. This suppression is widely believed to be mediated by intracortical inhibition. As an alternative, we propose that it can be explained by thalamocortical synaptic depression. This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast. It explains why transient responses to flashed stimuli are nonlinear, whereas spatial summation is primarily linear. These results suggest that the very first synapses into the cortex, and not the cortical network, may account for important response properties of V1 neurons.

AB  - We perform a comprehensive study of the dominant two- and higher-loop contributions to the Tl-205, neutron and muon electric dipole moments induced by Higgs bosons, third-generation quarks and squarks, charginos and gluinos in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We find that strong correlations exist among the contributing CP-violating operators, for large stop, gluino and chargino phases, and for a wide range of values of tan beta and charged Higgs-boson masses, giving rise to large suppressions of the Tl-205 and neutron electric dipole moments below their present experimental limits. Based on this observation, we discuss the constraints that the non-observation of electric dipole moments imposes on the radiatively-generated CP-violating Higgs sector and on the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM. We improve previously suggested benchmark scenarios of maximal CP violation for analyzing direct searches of CP-violating MSSM Higgs bosons at high-energy colliders, and stress the important complementary role that a possible high-sensitivity measurement of the muon electric dipole moment to the level of 10(-24) e cm can play in such analyses.

AB  - Objective: To present the results of a systematic review of the literature published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2000, that reports findings on the prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders.
   Method: We conducted a literature search of schizophrenia-related epidemiological studies, using Medline and HealthSTAR databases and canvassing English-language publications. We used a set of predetermined inclusion-exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies. Eligible publications were restricted to age ranges of 18 years and over for prevalence studies and 15 years and over for incidence studies. Prevalence and incidence data were extracted and analyzed for heterogeneity.
   Results: A total of 18 prevalence and 8 incidence studies met eligibility criteria for the review. Heterogeneity analysis revealed significant differences across 1-year and lifetime prevalence and 1-year incidence of schizophrenia. The corresponding pooled rates were: 0.34 per 100, 0.55 per 100, and 11.1 per 100 000, respectively; the variation in rates between studies was generally between 2- and 51-fold.
   Conclusions: Although we restricted this review to studies using rigorous and relatively homogeneous methods, there remains significant heterogeneity of prevalence and incidence rates. This strengthens support for the hypothesis that there is real variation in the distribution of schizophrenia around the world. Health planners need to have local data on schizophrenia rates to improve the accuracy of their interventions, while clinicians and researchers need to continue to investigate the etiology of this variation.

AB  - The first choice group of psychotropic agents in schizophrenia is neuroleptics. However, this treatment is not effective in all patients and with every symptom. We summarize papers published on the role of antiepileptic drugs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We have searched the computer database system MEDLINE for relevant articles including reviews, reports of drug studies and case histories. Antiepileptic drugs can change symptoms of schizophrenia by their action on GABA-ergic neurotransmission or via anti-glutamatergic mechanisms. High doses of adjunctive benzodiazepines reduce positive symptoms, anxiety, and agitation. Carbamazepine is effective in affective symptoms of schizophrenia and influences violent behavior in psychotic patients. Its anti-kindling action may represent a promising treatment strategy for some patients with chronic course of schizophrenia. Valproate treatment leads to a decrease in positive symptoms as well as hostility. Lamotrigine is expected to influence the positive, negative, affective, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. New antiepileptics (e.g., gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, vigabatrin) present a promise as potential adjuncts to neuroleptic treatment in resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.

In this review, we summarize the recent research and discuss several unresolved scientific issues that must be addressed to make epidemiology more useful to policy-makers. We then discuss implications for policy-making to improve children's mental health outcomes. Overall, given the high prevalence rates, increasing clinical services alone will not suffice; rather, a multifaceted mix of strategies is required.

   Method: A Medline search was conducted for RCTs, using the following key words: Alzheimer's disease, dementia, therapy, cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Studies were critically appraised, followed by a review of published major. clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations for treatment were made based on best available evidence.
   Results: The pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease should include the meticulous management of vascular risk factors (for example, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, and stroke prophylaxis) and consideration for supplementation with folate, vitamin B complex, and vitamin E. Patients should be offered at least I trial of a cholinesterase inhibitor, with the possibility of another trial if the first is poorly tolerated or ineffective. Patients with vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies should also be offered treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. At this time, we lack sufficient data to recommend the use of hormone replacement or antiinflammatory therapy for treatment of dementia as the primary indication.
   Conclusion: Reasonable evidence exists to provide recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of dementia. Treatment will likely result in modest but important benefits to patients, caregivers, and society.

AB  - Differential diagnosis of motor symptoms, for example, akinesia, may be difficult in clinical neuropsychiatry. Symptoms may I be either of neurologic origin, for example, Parkinson's disease, or of psychiatric origin, for example, catatonia, leading to a so-called "conflict of paradigms." Despite their different origins, symptoms may appear more or less clinically similar. Possibility of dissociation between origin and clinical appearance may reflect functional brain organisation in general, and cortical-cortical/subcortical relations in particular. It is therefore hypothesized that similarities and differences between Parkinsons disease and catatonia may be accounted for by distinct kinds of modulation between cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical relations. Catatonia can be characterized by concurrent motor, emotional, and behavioural symptoms. The different symptoms may be accounted for by dysfunction in orbitofrontal-prefrontal/parietal cortical connectivity reflecting "horizontal modulation" of cortico-cortical relation. Furthermore, alteration in "top-down modulation" reflecting "vertical modulation" of caudate and other basal ganglia by GABA-ergic mediated orbitofrontal cortical deficits may account for motor symptoms in catatonia. Parkinson's disease, in contrast, can be characterized by predominant motor symptoms. Motor symptoms may be accounted for by altered "bottom-up modulation" between dopaminergic mediated deficits in striatum and pre-motor/motor cortex. Clinical similarities between Parkinson's disease and catatonia with respect to akinesia may be related with involvement of the basal ganglia in both disorders. Clinical differences with respect to emotional and behavioural symptoms may be related with involvement of different cortical areas, that is, orbitofrontal/parietal and premotor/motor cortex implying distinct kinds of modulation - "vertical" and "horizontal" modulation, respectively.

AB  - A review of the literature suggests that individual variability in sex-related traits may be influenced by variations in hormonal exposure during fetal development. In litter-bearing mammals, fetuses develop in utero and may be subjected to differing hormonal environments based upon the sex of neighboring fetuses. Female fetuses developing between two males tend to show masculinized anatomical, physiological and behavioral traits as adults. Female fetuses developing without adjacent males, on the other hand, tend to show more feminized traits as adults. These traits include permanently altered hormone levels, reproductive organs, aggressive behaviors, secondary sex ratios and susceptibility to endocrine disruption. This intrauterine effect is due to the transfer of testosterone from male fetuses to adjacent fetuses. while these effects have been most clearly demonstrated in mice, other rodents and swine also show intrauterine position (IUP) effects. Some of these effects are similar to the influence of prenatal stress on adult phenotypes. A few reports on human twins suggest that variability in some masculine and feminine traits may be due to intrauterine hormonal signals. IUP effects may impact a number of scientific fields of research such as endocrine disruption, toxicology, population biology, animal production and health. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Method We used a systematic search strategy to identify RCTs that included adults aged 18-75 years with a diagnosis of unipolar depression that had not responded to a 4-week course of a recommended dose of an antidepressant.
   Results We identified 16 RCTs. None of the included trials assessed the efficacy of psychotherapy All the trials were too small to detect an important clinical response. We found only two trials on lithium augmentation, which randomised 50 subjects in total.
   Conclusions There is little evidence to guide the management of depression that has not responded to a course of antidepressants. Treatment-refractory depression is an important public health problem and large pragmatic trials are needed to inform clinical practice.

AB  - Throughout the history of neuroscience, dendritic spines have been considered stable structures, but in recent years, imaging techniques have revealed that spines are constantly changing shape. Spine motility is difficult to categorize, has different forms, and possibly even represents multiple phenomena. It is influenced by synaptic transmission, intracellular calcium, and a multitude of ions and other molecules. An actin-based cascade mediates this phenomenon, and while the precise signaling pathways are still unclear, the Rho family of GTPases could well be a "common denominator" controlling spine morphology. One role of spine motility might be to enable a searching function during synaptogenesis, allowing for more efficacious neuronal connectivity in the neuronal thicket. This idea revisits concepts originally formulated by Cajal, who proposed over a hundred years ago that spines might help to increase and modify synaptic connections.

AB  - Widespread thermal anomalies in 1997-1998, due primarily to regional effects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and possibly augmented by global warming, caused severe coral bleaching worldwide. Corals in all habitats along the Belizean barrier reef bleached as a result of elevated sea temperatures in the summer and fall of 1998, and in fore-reef habitats of the outer barrier reef and offshore platforms they showed signs of recovery in 1999. In contrast, coral populations on reefs in the central shelf lagoon died off catastrophically. Based on an analysis of reef cores, this was the first bleaching-induced mass coral mortality in the central lagoon in at least the last 3,000 years. Satellite data for the Channel Cay reef complex, the most intensively studied of the lagoonal reefs, revealed a prolonged period of elevated sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the late summer and early fall of 1998. From 18 September to I October 1998, anomalies around this reef averaged +2.2degreesC, peaking at 4.0degreesC above the local HotSpot threshold. In situ temperature records from a nearby site corroborated the observation that the late summer and early fall of 1998 were extraordinarily warm compared to other years. The lettuce coral, Agaricia tenuifolia, which was the dominant occupant of space on reef slopes in the central lagoon, was nearly eradicated at Channel Cay between October 1998 and January 1999. Although the loss of Ag. tenuifolia opened extensive areas of carbonate substrate for colonization, coral cover remained extremely low and coral recruitment was depressed through March 2001. High densities of the sea urchin Echinometra viridis kept the cover of fleshy and filamentous macroalgae to low levels, but the cover of an encrusting sponge, Chondrilla cf. nucula, increased. Further increases in sponge cover will impede the recovery of Ag. tenuifolia and other coral species by decreasing the availability of substrate for recruitment and growth. If coral populations are depressed on a long-term basis, the vertical accretion of skeletal carbonates at Channel Cay will slow or cease over the coming decades, a time during which global-warming scenarios predict accelerated sea-level rise.

AB  - Scientific advances in the field of emotions suggest a framework for conceptualizing the emotion-related aspects of prevention programs that aim to enhance children's socioemotional competence and prevent the emergence of behavior problems and psychopathology. A conception of emotions as inherently adaptive and motivational and the related empirical evidence from several disciplines and specialities suggest 7 principles for developing preventive interventions: the utilization of positive and negative emotions, emotion modulation as a mediator of emotion utilization, emotion patterns in states and traits. different processes of emotion activation, emotion communication in early life. and the development of connections for the modular and relatively independent emotions and cognitive systems. Each principle's practical implications and application in current prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - Objective: The evolution of views regarding the impact of psychosocial factors on peptic ulcer was traced by examining all articles related to the upper gastrointestinal tract published in Psychosomatic Medicine since its inception. Methods: Titles were retrieved using MEDLINE and by manually searching tables of contents for the years 1939 through 2000. The articles were classified by type and reviewed for gastrointestinal topic, broad biopsychosocial themes, methodology, and hypotheses. Results: One hundred seven articles were found, peaking in the 1960s. Of these, 73.8% reported large-sample research, 10.3% were case reports or series (all before 1965), and 15.9% were review articles or commentaries (most frequent before 1950 and after 1990). The chief topic was peptic ulcer in 47.7%, ulcer related in 29.9%, nonulcer dyspepsia or motility in 15.0% (dominating research since 1990), and miscellaneous in 7.5%. Original investigations related to peptic ulcer dropped off steadily after 1970. Attention was consistently paid to interactions of psychological factors with gastric acid secretion but not with several other important ulcer risk factors: Helicobacter pylori, smoking, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Interest in personality, stress, and laboratory methodology remained steady over time, whereas psychoanalysis and the specificity hypothesis declined, and statistical comparisons and quantitative approaches to psychological assessment rose. Conclusions: Psychosomatic Medicine articles reflect the life history of the stress-acid theory of peptic ulcer: hypothesis generation through case studies; a boom of experimental research; and retrenchment into literature reviews with a falloff in original investigations when new views of etiology and effective medical therapies appeared.

AB  - Background: Chronic depressive disorders are common, accounting for approximately one-third of all cases of depression and posing a major public health problem. In the past, chronic depression has been thought to be treatment-resistant, and evidence suggests that it is currently underdiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and suboptimally treated.
   Objectives: To review the subtypes of chronic depression and the evidence-base concerning their optimal treatment and to discuss some key clinical issues and areas of future research.
   Methods: We identified key studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by systematically searching electronic databases and hand searching specialist journals and bibliographies.
   Results: Chronic depressive disorders respond well to standard pharmacologic interventions in the acute and maintenance phases of treatment. Standard psychotherapies alone may not be efficacious for chronic depression (especially dysthymia). Recent evidence suggests that treatment combining psychotherapy and medications may be superior to either treatment alone.
   Conclusions: Chronic depressive disorders are amenable to treatment, provided that intervention is both thorough and intensive. Although our knowledge about the optimal treatment of chronic depression has developed rapidly, changes in clinical practice have been slower to evolve. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions for chronic depression in more naturalistic settings.

   Aims To estimate rates of fatal and non-fatal repetition of self-harm.
   Method A systematic review of published follow-up data, from observational and experimental studies. Four electronic databases were searched and 90 studies met the inclusion criteria.
   Results Eighty per cent of studies found were undertaken in Europe, over one third in the UK. Median proportions for repetition 1 year later were: 16% non-fatal and 2% fatal; after more than 9 years, around 7% of patients had died by suicide. The UK studies found particularly low rates of subsequent suicide.
   Conclusions After 1 year, non-fatal repetition rates are around 15%. The strong connection between self-harm and later suicide lies somewhere between 0.5% and 2% after 1 year and above 5% after 9 years. Suicide risk among self-harm patients is hundreds of times higher than in the general population.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a mental disease that affects approximately 1% of the population with life-long devastating consequences. Based on evidence for a major contribution of genetic factors, a decade of extensive efforts has been dedicated to the search of DNA sequence variations that increase the risk to SCZ. Search for genes in rare multiplex SCZ families with a large number of affected individuals and quasi-Mendelian mode of inheritance using genetic linkage methodology has been one of the favorite strategies in psychiatric genetics. Although several genomic regions were suggested for linkage to SCZ, not a single gene causing or predisposing to SCZ has been identified thus far. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the genes of familial SCZ are also involved in sporadic cases that represent the overwhelming majority of SCZ patients. For sporadic cases, genetic association studies comparing the distribution of allelic frequencies of candidate genes in SCZ patients and controls have been performed but the outcome of such studies has also been quite modest. Several factors such as possible involvement of numerous interactive genes of minor effect, yet unknown environmental effects and diagnostic ambiguities of the disease have made genetic studies in SCZ quite unproductive. In terms of future studies, a genome-wide association search is a promising approach; however, this approach requires genotyping of thousands of genetic markers in large samples. In addition, a detailed analysis of the genes, expression of which changes under the influence of environmental factors, can indicate good candidates for genetic association studies. In this connection, investigations of the epigenetic regulation of genes and not only the DNA sequence variation, may be necessary for complete understanding of the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SCZ.

AB  - Cortical potentials were recorded from implanted electrodes during a difficult working memory task requiring rapid storage, modification and retrieval of multiple memoranda. Synchronous event-related potentials were generated in distributed occipital, parietal, Rolandic and prefrontal sites beginning similar to130 ms after stimulus onset and continuing for >500 ms. Coherent phase-locked, event-related oscillations supported interaction between these dorsal stream structures throughout the task period. The Rolandic structures generated early as well as sustained potentials to sensory stimuli in the absence of movement. Activation peaks and phase lags between synaptic populations suggested that perceptual processing occurred exclusively in the visual association cortex from similar to90 to 130 ms, with its results projected to fronto-parietal areas for interpretation from similar to130 to 280 ms. The direction of interaction then appeared to reverse from similar to300 to 400 ms, consistent with mental arithmetic being performed by fronto-parietal areas operating upon a visual scratch pad in the dorsolateral occipital cortex. A second reversal, from similar to420 to 600 ms, may have represented an updating of memoranda stored in fronto-parietal sites. Lateralized perisylvian oscillations suggested an articulatory loop. Anterior cingulate activity was evoked by feedback signals indicating errors. These results indicate how a fronto-centro-parietal 'central executive' might interact with an occipital visual scratch pad, perisylvian articulatory loop and limbic monitor to implement the sequential stages of a complex mental operation.

AB  - The biochemical bases of the placebo effect are still incompletely known. We show here that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is due, at least in part, to the release of dopamine In the striatum. We propose that the placebo effect might be related to reward mechanisms. The expectation of reward (i.e. clinical benefit) seems to be particularly relevant. According to this theory, brain dopamine release could be a common biochemical substrate for the placebo effect encountered in other medical conditions, such as pain and depression. Other neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, however, are also likely to be involved in mediating the placebo effect (e.g. opioids In pain disorders, serotonin in depression).

   Method: Medline and PsychInfo were searched using the key words: homeless person, mental illness, psychosis, and schizophrenia. The bibliographies of identified articles were also reviewed.
   Results: Study designs varied considerably. The rate of schizophrenia in homeless persons reported in the 33 published reports, representing eight different countries, ranged from 2 to 45%. In the 10 methodologically superior studies, the prevalence range was 4-16% and the weighted average prevalence was 11%. In addition, rates were higher in younger persons, women and the chronically homeless. Slightly less than half of the homeless persons with schizophrenia were not currently receiving treatment.
   Conclusion: Schizophrenia is much more prevalent among homeless persons than in the population at large. Future research should focus on better ways of meeting the mental health care needs of homeless people with schizophrenia.

AB  - The effect of seasons on suicides has been suggested repeatedly. In order to reveal a true seasonal pattern, an, appropriate statistical technique, which is sensitive to a specific type of cyclic variation in the data, must be chosen. This study is a review of the use of statistical techniques for seasonality and of some important characteristics of study samples that were evaluated from 46 original suicide seasonality articles published in major psychiatric journals. The results showed that statistical techniques were applied in a majority of articles, but they were commonly lacking regarding analyses, which compared seasonal patterns among subgroups of a population. In recent studies more sophisticated statistical techniques were utilized for seasonality, like spectral analyses, as compared with earlier studies, in which the emphasis was on chi-square tests. Lack of reporting essential features of the data, such as the sample size and monthly values of suicides, were frequent. The calendar effect was adjusted only in 11 studies. Some recommendations concerning the methodological and reporting issues are summarized for future articles on the seasonal affect on suicides.

AB  - A 'simulation' theory of cognitive function can be based on three assumptions about brain function. First, behaviour can be simulated by activating motor structures, as during an overt action but suppressing its execution. Second, perception can be simulated by internal activation of sensory cortex, as during normal perception of external stimuli. Third, both overt and covert actions can elicit perceptual simulation of their normal consequences. A large body of evidence supports these assumptions. It is argued that the simulation approach can explain the relations between motor, sensory and cognitive functions and the appearance of an inner world.

AB  - The pteridine tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor in the biosynthesis of dopamine, (nor)epinephrine, serotonin and nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore, BH4 has a direct influence on release mechanisms of these neurotransmitters and on serotonin receptor binding activity immunology. The synthesis of BH4 is stimulated by interferon-gamma and hence there is a close relationship with the immune system HPA-axis. In animal experiments it was also found that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis influences the pteridine metabolism. In clinical studies, so far, no evidence has been found for this relationship diseases. A congenital biopterin deficiency results in atypical phenylketonuria with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. In several neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, decreased levels of BH4 are found depression. Since 1984 there have been reports on decreased biopterin and increased neopterin levels in urine and plasma of depressed patients. Conflicting results have also been found, however, due probably to methodological problems therapy. Until now, oral administration of BH4 to depressed patients has been performed by two investigators, which resulted in mainly temporal clinical improvement discussion. Understanding of biochemical mechanisms in which pteridines are involved may contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders. This paper aims to provide an overview of the relevant literature and warrant for further research on this intriguing compound.

AB  - Background: The debate over whether clinical psychologists should be granted the right to prescribe psychoactive medication has received considerable attention over the last 2 decades in the US, but there has been relatively little discussion of this controversial topic among Canadian mental health professionals, namely psychologists and psychiatrists. Proponents of prescription privileges (PPs), including the American Psychological Association (APA), argue that psychologists do not and cannot function as independent professionals because the medical profession places many restrictions on their practice. It is believed that PPs would help circumvent professional psychology's impending marginalization by increasing psychology's scope of practice. Proponents also argue that PPs would enhance mental health services by increasing public access to professionals who can prescribe.
   Objective: The purpose of this article is to inform psychiatrists about the major arguments presented for and against PPs for psychologists and to discuss the major implications of PPs for both professional psychology and psychiatry.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search of relevant articles published from 1980 to the present appearing on Psychlit and Medline databases, using "prescription privileges" and "psychologists" as search titles.
   Conclusion: Although proponents present several compelling arguments in favour of PPs for psychologists, pilot projects relating to feasibility and efficacy are either sparse or incomplete, Thus, it is too soon to tell whether PPs could or should be pursued. Clearly, more research is needed before we conclude that PPs for psychologists are a safe and necessary solution to psychology's alleged impending marginalization.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia leads to brain damage caused by pathogenetic mechanisms that are also activated by neurotrauma. These mechanisms include among others excitotoxicity, over production of free radicals, inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, cerebral ischemia and trauma both trigger similar auto-protective mechanisms including the production of heat shock proteins, anti-inflammatory cytokines and endogenous antioxidants. Neuroprotective therapy aims at minimizing the activation of toxic pathways and at enhancing the activity of endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. The similarities in the damage-producing and endogenous auto-protective mechanisms may imply that neuroprotective compounds found to be active against one of these conditions may indeed be also protective in the other. This review summarizes the pathogenetic events of ischemic and traumatic brain injury and reviews the neuroprotective strategies employed thus far in each of these conditions with a special emphasize on their clinical relevance and on future directions in the field of neuronal protection.

AB  - A series of studies have reported that a high carbohydrate meal, or diets high in carbohydrate, were associated with feeling less energetic. However, after a drink containing pure sugar most studies report no effect. Meals almost exclusively carbohydrate increase the availability of tryptophan and hence serotonin synthesis in the brain, however, a small amount of protein blocks this mechanism making it an uncommon response. In many individuals, poor mood stimulates the eating of palatable high carbohydrate/high fat foods that stimulate the release of endorphins. There is a tendency for those with lower blood glucose, when performing cognitively demanding tasks, to report poorer mood. In a range of situations an association between a tendency for blood glucose levels to fall rapidly, and irritability, has been found. Differences in the ability to control blood glucose levels influence the association between carbohydrate intake and mood. There is a need in future research to contrast the impact of carbohydrate on mood in those distinguished because of their pre-existing psychological and physiological functioning.

AB  - During the past two decades many research teams have worked on the enhancement of the explanation capabilities of knowledge-based systems and decision support systems. During the same period, other researchers have worked on the development of argumentative techniques for software systems. We think that it would be interesting for the researchers belonging to these different communities to share their experiences and to develop systems that take advantage of the advances gained in each domain.
   We start by reviewing the evolution of explanation systems from the simple reasoning traces associated with early expert systems to recent research on interactive and collaborative explanations. We then discuss the characteristics of critiquing systems that test the credibility of the user's solution. The rest of the paper deals with the different application domains that use argumentative techniques. First, we discuss how argumentative reasoning can be captured by a general structure in which a given claim or conclusion is inferred from a set of data and how this argument structure relates to pragmatic knowledge, explanation production and practical reasoning. We discuss the role of argument in defeasible reasoning and present some works in the new field of computer-mediated defeasible argumentation. We review different application domains such as computer-mediated communication, design rationale, crisis management and knowledge management, in which argumentation support tools are used. We describe models in which arguments are associated to mental attitudes such as goals, plans and beliefs. We present recent advances in the application of argumentative techniques to multi-agent systems. Finally, we propose research perspectives for the integration of explanation and argumentation capabilities in knowledge-based systems and make suggestions for enhancing the argumentation and persuasion capabilities of software agents.

AB  - Nutrient over-enrichment in many areas around the world is having pervasive ecological effects on coastal ecosystems. These effects include reduced dissolved oxygen in aquatic systems and subsequent impacts on living resources. The largest zone of oxygen-depleted coastal waters in the United States, and the entire western Atlantic Ocean, is found in the northern Gulf of Mexico on the Louisiana/Texas continental shelf influenced by the freshwater discharge and nutrient load of the Mississippi River system. The mid-summer bottom areal extent of hypoxic waters (<2 mgl(-1) O-2) in 1985-1992 averaged 8000 to 9000 km(2) but increased to up to 16 000 to 20 700 km(2) in 1993-2001. The Mississippi River system is the dominant source of fresh water and nutrients to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi River nutrient concentrations and loading to the adjacent continental shelf have changed in the last half of the 20th century. The average annual nitrate concentration doubled, and the mean silicate concentration was reduced by 50%. There is no doubt that the average concentration and flux of nitrogen (per unit volume discharge) increased from the 1950s to 1980s, especially in the spring. There is considerable evidence that nutrient-enhanced primary production in the northern Gulf of Mexico is causally related to the oxygen depletion in the lower water column. Evidence from long-term data sets and the sedimentary record demonstrate that historic increases in riverine dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and loads over the last 50 years are highly correlated with indicators of increased productivity in the overlying water column, i.e. eutrophication of the continental shelf waters, and subsequent worsening of oxygen stress in the bottom waters. Evidence associates increased coastal ocean productivity and worsening oxygen depletion with changes in landscape use and nutrient management that resulted in nutrient enrichment of receiving waters. A steady-state model, calibrated to different observed summer conditions, was used to assess the response of the system to reductions in nutrient inputs. A reduction in surface layer chlorophyll and an increase in lower layer dissolved oxygen resulted from a reduction of either nitrogen or phosphorus loading, with the response being greater for nitrogen reductions.

AB  - The limited capacity of neural processing restricts the number of objects and locations that can be attended to. Selected events are readily enhanced: the bright side of attention. However, such focal processing comes at a cost, namely, functional blindness for unattended events: the dark side of visual attention. Recent work has advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms that facilitate visual processing, as well as the neural correlates of unattended, unconscious visual events. Also, new results have revealed how attentional deployment is optimized by non-visual factors such as behavioral set, past experience, and emotional salience.

AB  - This paper systematically reviews the literature on the effectiveness of physical activity programs at worksites with respect to work-related outcomes. A computerized literature search, a reference search, and a manual search of personal databases were performed using the following inclusion criteria: randomized controlled or controlled trial, working population, worksite intervention program to promote physical activity or physical fitness, and work-related outcomes. The study quality was evaluated using nine methodological criteria. Conclusions were based on a 5-level rating system of evidence. Eight studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 4 controlled trials) were identified, but their methodological quality was generally poor. The outcomes were absenteeism, job satisfaction, job stress, productivity, and employee turnover. The evidence of an effect was limited for absenteeism, inconclusive for job satisfaction, job stress and employee turnover, and nil for productivity. The scientific evidence on the effectiveness of physical activity programs at worksites is still limited. Because of the few high-quality randomized controlled trials, it is strongly suggested that this type of Study be carried Out. Future randomized controlled trials should pay special attention to the description of randomization, inclusion criteria, compliance, and analyses according to intention to treat.

AB  - Increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases projected for the 21st century are expected to lead to increased mean global air and ocean temperatures. The National Assessment of PotentiaI Consequences of Climate Variability and Change (NAST 2001) was based on a series of regional and sector assessments. This paper is a summary of the coastal and marine resources sector review of potential impacts on shorelines, estuaries, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and ocean margin ecosystems. The assessment considered the impacts of several key drivers of climate change: sea level change; alterations in precipitation patterns and subsequent delivery of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment; increased ocean temperature; alterations in circulation patterns; changes in frequency and intensity of coastal storms; and increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Increasing rates of sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of coastal storms and hurricanes over the next decades will increase threats to shorelines, wetlands, and coastal development. Estuarine productivity will change in response to alteration in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment delivery. Higher water temperatures and changes in freshwater delivery will alter estuarine stratification, residence time, and eutrophication. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to increase coral bleaching and higher CO2 levels may reduce coral calcification, making it more difficult for corals to recover from other disturbances, and inhibiting poleward shifts. Ocean warming is expected to cause poleward shifts in the ranges of many other organisms, including commercial species, and these shifts may have secondary effects on their predators and prey. Although these potential impacts of climate change and variability will vary from system to system, it is important to recognize that they will be superimposed upon, and in many cases intensify, other ecosystem stresses (pollution, harvesting, habitat destruction, invasive species, land and resource use, extreme natural events), which may lead to more significant consequences.

AB  - Although the toxic effects of acrylamide on the peripheral nervous system have been well established, less attention has been paid to its effects on the brain. Nevertheless, (1) ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlarged cerebral ventricles and cisterns in rats treated with acrylamide 50 mg/kg/d for 8 cl, (2) creatine kinase (CK) activities were suppressed in the brain from such rats and mice, (3) CK activities in the brains of mice intoxicated with acrylamide changed in parallel with neurological dysfunction, (4) in human cases of acrylamide intoxication due to occupational exposure, symptoms suggesting brain involvement were seen in a few, and (5) cases of acrylamide intoxication due to contaminated well water showed unquestionable signs of brain dysfunction including mental confusion with hallucinations. These indicate that acrylamide can cause encephalopathy in animals as well as in humans, and that the spectrum of impairment of the nervous system can vary greatly depending on the mode of exposure.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper is to review the prevalence, predictors and methods for improving medication adherence in unipolar and bipolar affective disorders.
   Method: Studies were identified through Medline and PsycLit searches of English language publications between 1976 and 2001. This was supplemented by a hand search and the inclusion of selected descriptive articles on good clinical practice.
   Results: Estimates of medication non-adherence for unipolar and bipolar disorders range from 10 to 60% (median 40%). This prevalence has not changed significantly with the introduction of new medications. There is evidence that attitudes and beliefs are at least as important as side-effects in predicting adherence. The limited number of empirical studies of how to reduce non-adherence offer encouraging evidence that, if recognized, the problem can be overcome.
   Conclusion: Only 1-2% of all publications on the treatment of affective disorders explore factors associated with medication non-adherence. This is disappointing as research and clinical data highlight the importance of extended courses of medication in improving the long-term prognosis of affective disorders.

AB  - Understanding toxicant effects at higher levels of biological organization continues to be a challenge in ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment. This is due in part to a tradition in ecotoxicology of considering the direct effects of toxicants on a limited number of model test species. However, the indirect effects of toxicity may be a significant factor influencing the manner in which ecosystem structure and function respond to anthropogenic stressors. Subsequently, failure to incorporate indirect effects into risk assessment paradigms may be a significant source of uncertainty in risk estimates. The current paper addresses the importance of indirect effects in an ecotoxicological context. Laboratory, mesocosm, and whole ecosystem research into indirect effects is reviewed. The implications of indirect effects for ecological risk assessment and potential areas of profitable future research are also discussed.

AB  - An approach to the description of subdynamics inside the nonrelativistic quantum field theory is presented, in which the notions of relevant observable, time scale and complete positivity of the time evolution are stressed. A scattering theory derivation of the subdynamics of a microsystern interacting through collisions with a macrosystem is given, leading to a master equation expressed in terms of the operator-valued structure factor, a two-point correlation function which compactly takes the statistical mechanics properties of the macrosystem into account. For the case of a free quantum gas the dynamic structure factor can be exactly calculated and in the long wave-length limit a Fokker-Planck equation for the description of quantum dissipation and in particular quantum Brownian motion is obtained, where peculiar corrections due to quantum statistics can be put into evidence.

AB  - Method: We performed a literature search using Medline and Psycinfo databases and Google Internet search engine.
   Results: We identified 6 clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). All stress the need for antipsychotic therapy and psychosocial interventions. Differences lie in types of antipsychotics recommended, duration of antipsychotic trial, management of extrapyramidal symptoms, and types of psychosocial interventions. Areas poorly addressed by all guidelines include definition of the stable phase of schizophrenia, management of adverse effects with atypical agents, management of clozapine nonresponders, and management of personality issues.
   Conclusion: Published CPGs are helpful in the management of the stable phase of schizophrenia, although no single CPG series appears to address all treatment needs faced by practising clinicians.

AB  - Selegiline, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), was one of the first adjunct therapies in clinical neurology. A retrospective analysis of data from patients with Parkinson's disease found a significant increase in survival in those treated with selegiline plus L-dopa compared with L-dopa alone. The mechanism of action of selegiline is complex and cannot be explained solely by its MAO-B inhibitory action. Pretreatment with selegiline can protect neurons against a variety of neurotoxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 6-hydroxydopamine, N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), methyl-beta-acetoxyethyl-2-chloroethylamine (AF64A), and 5,6-dihydroxyserotonin, which damage dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, and sertoninergic neurons, respectively. Selegiline produces an amphetamine-like effect, enhances the release of dopamine, and blocks the reuptake of dopamine. It stimulates gene expression of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, increases striatal phenylethylamine levels, and activates dopamine receptors. Selegiline reduces the production of oxidative radicals, up-regulates superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppresses nonenzymatic and iron-catalyzed autooxidation of dopamine. Selegiline compensates for loss of target-derived trophic support, delays apoptosis in serum-deprived cells, and blocks apoptosis-related fall in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Most of the aforementioned properties occur independently of selegiline's efficacy to inhibit MAO-B. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a useful method for studying a number of psychotropic medications and metabolites in human brain in vivo. New insights regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of psychotropic medications in the target organ (i.e., brain) have been obtained using lithium-7 MRS and fluorine-19 MRS. Both proton and phosphorus-31 MRS have significantly enhanced our knowledge of the pathophysiology of a number of psychiatric disorders by providing estimates of brain concentrations of several important cerebral metabolites. Efforts are also being made to link MRS measures of cerebral metabolism with neurophysiologic and neurocognitive processes. Ongoing improvement and refinement in MRS techniques, including the installation of scanners with increased magnetic field strength and better methods of data processing, will improve both spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, efforts to develop multisite research studies may result in greater standardization of MRS procedures and methods for interpretation of results. In this review, the current status of MRS applications in psychiatric research is reviewed, and new frontiers and possible future developments are discussed.

AB  - Seasonal asymmetry in yearly suicide occurrence is a long-observed phenomenon in psychiatric, suicidological and sociological research, and the effects of seasonal factors on suicidal behaviour have been the focus of a number of earlier studies. Taking into account limitations of data and methods, these studies have in general favoured interpretations based on psychosocial factors. Recent studies have challenged the widely held notion that seasonal effects on suicide are not influenced by age, gender or the circumstances of the act. The suicides committed with violent methods have been shown to follow clearer seasonal patterns than suicides by less violent methods, and differences have been found between male and female cycles of occurrence. The seasonal occurrence of suicides has also been found to differ significantly between the young and the elderly. The use of inappropriate statistics or age- and gender-biased samples may have hidden a seasonal component in some previous studies on attempted suicide. The absence of seasonality in earlier studies on attempted suicide was interpreted as depending upon the minor relevance of psychiatric and biological factors in non-fatal self-harm. However, recent studies have reported clear seasonality in attempted suicide samples, with older people showing greater seasonal effect. Recent literature after 1985 on seasonal variation and weather or climate influence in attempted and completed suicide is reviewed. Suggestions for research and the development of more effective preventative strategies are offered.

AB  - Autistic disorder is a behavioural syndrome beginning before the age of 3 years and lasting over the whole lifetime. It is characterised by impaired communication, impaired social interactions, and repetitive interests and behaviour. The prevalence is about 7/10,000 taking a restrictive definition and more than 1/500 with a broader definition, including all the pervasive developmental disorders. The importance of genetic factors has been highlighted by epidemiological studies showing that autistic disorder is one of the most genetic neuropsychiatric diseases. The relative risk of first relatives is about 100-fold higher than the risk in the normal population and the concordance in monozygotic twin is about 60%. Different strategies have been applied on the track of susceptibility genes. The systematic search of linked loci led to contradictory results, in part due to the heterogeneity of the clinical definitions, to the differences in the DNA markers, and to the different methods of analysis used. An oversimplification of the inferred model is probably also cause of our disappointment. More work is necessary to give a clearer picture. One region emerges more frequently: the long arm of chromosome 7. Several candidate genes have been studied and some gave indications of association: the Reelin gene and the Wnt2 gene. Cytogenetical abnormalities are frequent at 15q11-13, the region of the Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome. Imprinting plays an important role in this region, no candidate gene has been identified in autism. Biochemical abnormalities have been found in the serotonin system. Association and linkage studies gave no consistent results with some serotonin receptors and in the transporter, although it seems interesting to go further in the biochemical characterisation of the serotonin transporter activity, particularly in platelets, easily accessible. Two monogenic diseases have been associated with autistic disorder: tuberous sclerosis and fragile X. A better knowledge of the pathophysiology of these disorders can help to understand autism. Different other candidate genes have been tested, positive results await replications in other samples. Animal models have been developed, generally by knocking out the different candidate genes. Behaviour studies have mainly focused on anxiety and learning paradigms. Another group of models results from surgical or toxic lesions of candidate regions in the brain, in general during development. The tools to analyse these animals are not yet standardised, and an important effort needs to be undertaken. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The way genetic and/or environmental factors influence psychiatric disorders is an enduring question in the field of human psychiatric diseases. Anxiety-related disorders provide a relevant example of how such an interaction is involved in the aetiology of a psychiatric disease. In this paper we review the literature on that subject, reporting data derived from human and rodent studies. We present in a critical way the animal models used in the studies aimed at investigating the genetic basis of anxiety, including inbred mice, selected lines, multiple marker strains, or knockout mice and review data reporting environmental components influencing anxiety-related behaviours. We conclude that anxiety is a complex behaviour, underlined not only by genetic or environmental factors but also by multiple interactions between these two factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Evidence suggests the estrogens may play a role in various mental and neurodegenerative diseases. We review the evidence implicating estradiol in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Epidermiologic and clinical studies on the effects of estrogens in schizophrenia are surveyed, and animal studies and in vitro models of the modulatory effects of estrogens on neurotransmitters associated with schizophrenia (i.e., dopamine, serotonin, glutamate) are reviewed. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggesting a role for estrogens in Parkinson's disease and in vivo and in vitro models demonstrating neuroprotective effects of estrogens are then examined. Despite the numerous animal studies on the effects of estrogens in the brain, clinical data are sparse and often contradictory. Compounds with more specific and potent estrogenic activity in the brain are required to further research efforts in this area. Possible candidates are the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), whose agonist or antagonist properties depend on the target tissue. The effects of various SERMs in the brain are reviewed, and our novel findings on the effects of SERMs on 5-HT2A receptors in the rat cortex and nucleus accumbens are presented. We suggest that drugs with estrogenic activity in the brain may have therapeutic potential, either by modulating brain neurotransmission or through neuroprotective activity.

AB  - Phytoremediation technologies based on the combined action of plants and the microbial communities that they support within the rhizosphere hold promise in the remediation of land and waterways contaminated with hydrocarbons but they have not yet been adopted in large-scale remediation strategies. In this review plant and microbial degradative capacities, viewed as a continuum, have been dissected in order to identify where bottlenecks and limitations exist. Phenols, anilines and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were selected as the target classes of molecule for consideration, in part because of their common patterns of distribution, but also because of the urgent need to develop techniques to overcome their toxicity to human health.
   Depending on the chemical and physical properties of the pollutant, the emerging picture suggests that plants will draw pollutants including PAHs into the plant rhizosphere to varying extents via the transpiration stream. Mycorrhizosphere-bacteria and -fungi may play a crucial role in establishing plants in degraded ecosystems. Within the rhizosphere, microbial degradative activities prevail in order to extract energy and carbon skeletons from the pollutants for microbial cell growth. There has been little systematic analysis of the changing dynamics of pollutant degradation within the rhizosphere; however, the importance of plants in supplying oxygen and nutrients to the rhizosphere via fine roots, and of the beneficial effect of microorganisms on plant root growth is stressed. In addition to their role in supporting rhizospheric degradative activities, plants may possess a limited capacity to transport some of the more mobile pollutants into roots and shoots via fine roots. In those situations where uptake does occur (i.e. only limited microbial activity in the rhizosphere) there is good evidence that the pollutant may be metabolised. However, plant uptake is frequently associated with the inhibition of plant growth and an increasing tendency to oxidant stress. Pollutant tolerance seems to correlate with the ability to deposit large quantities of pollutant metabolites in the 'bound' residue fraction of plant cell walls compared to the vacuole. In this regard, particular attention is paid to the activities of peroxidases, laccases, cytochromes P450, glucosyltransferases and ABC transporters. However, despite the seemingly large diversity of these proteins, direct proof of their participation in the metabolism of industrial aromatic pollutants is surprisingly scarce and little is known about their control in the overall metabolic scheme. Little is known about the bioavailability of bound metabolites; however, there may be a need to prevent their movement into wildlife food chains. In this regard, the application to harvested plants of composting techniques based on the degradative capacity of white-rot fungi merits attention.

AB  - This meta-analysis investigated the possibility that gender differences in aggression, and the variability in these differences, are a function of gender differences in the regulation of arousal generated in emotionally evocative contexts. The sample of studies for this analysis was based on an exhaustive search of the relevant research reports from 1965-1999. Studies were excluded from the sample if they were case studies; investigated spousal/familial or societal violence, war, suicide, or political violence; involved clinical or deviant participants; included fewer than 10 participants; included all male, all female, all non-Caucasian, or non-US/non-Canadian participants. Based on previous evidence that males may be more easily aroused by aggressive-relevant emotional stimuli than females, and that males may have more difficulty regulating emotionally arousing states than females, we hypothesized that the magnitude of the gender differences in aggression would covary, in a nonlinear manner, with the emotional evocativeness of the study context. Consistent with our hypothesis, the magnitude of gender differences in aggression was relatively small in research contexts that appeared to produce no or large increments in emotional arousal and larger (favoring males) in contexts that appeared to produce small or medium increments in emotional arousal.

AB  - As in other cells, neurons use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source to drive biochemical processes involved in various cell functions, and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as "by products" of oxidative phosphorylation. However, the electrical excitability and structural and synaptic complexity of neurons present unusual demands upon cellular systems that produce or respond to ATP and ROS. Mitochondria in axons and presynaptic terminals provide sources of ATP to drive the ion pumps that are concentrated in these structures to rapidly restore ion gradients following depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Mitochondria may also play important roles in the regulation of synaptic function because of their ability to regulate calcium levels and ROS production. ROS generated in response to synaptic activity are now known to contribute to the regulation of long-term structural and functional changes in neurons, and the best-known example is the nitric oxide radical. The high-energy demands of synapses, together with their high levels of ROS production, place them at risk during conditions of increased stress, which occur in aging, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and after acute traumatic and ischemic insults. Energy depletion and/or increased oxidative damage to various synaptic proteins can result in a local dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and synaptic degeneration. Accordingly, recent studies have shown that dietary and pharmacological manipulations that improve energy efficiency and reduce oxyradical production can prevent synaptic degeneration and neuronal death in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders. A better understanding of the molecular control of subcellular energy production and utilization, and of the functional relationships between energy metabolism, ion homeostasis, and cytoskeletal and vesicular dynamics, will provide novel insight into mechanisms of neuronal plasticity and disease.

The broader term is used here simply in the interest of attracting the widest general readership of investigators interested in basal ganglia function.

AB  - The relations between behavior, olfactory input (monitored by recording the activity of the olfactory mucosa), and the spontaneous field potentials of the dentate gyrus were studied in freely moving rats. Bursts of 30-80 Hz gamma) waves were elicited in the dentate gyrus when a rat sniffed at a variety of objects but were not elicited by auditory, somesthetic, or visual inputs and were not related to the occurrence of locomotion. The presence of gamma wave activity was associated with an enhancement of the population spike elicited in the dentate gyrus by stimulation of the perforant path. Odorized air blown into a nostril via a cannula, inserted under light urethane anesthesia, elicited a gamma wave response bilaterally in the dentate gyrus. These and other data were reviewed to support the general hypothesis that the hippocampus is primarily an olfacto-motor mechanism and does not play any unique role in learning and memory, cognitive mapping, or emotion. The role of the hippocampus in the control of some forms of motor activity is supported by numerous anatomical and electrophysiological studies, studies of the effect of hippocampal lesions on behavior, and studies of the effects of electrical or chemical stimulation of the hippocampus on behavior.

Finally, we examine the relationship between dissociation and children's resistance to misinformation, provide a critical review of the strengths and limitations of the extant literature, and suggest directions for future research and theoretical developments in the field.

   Method: Relevant studies were identified by literature searches (Pubmed, web of science) and through reference lists. The search was ended by May 2001.
   Results: There is evidence of involvement of opioid, glutamatergic, GABAergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic and neuroendocrine pathways in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Medications shown to be effective in double-blind placebo-controlled trials includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reversible and irreversible MAO-inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine. Still more agents appear promising in open-label trials.
   Conclusion: The complexity of the psychobiology is reflected by the difficulties in treating the disorder. According to the present knowledge, suggestions for drug treatment of PTSD are made.

AB  - Background: Mental health care is delivered through a relationship between a clinician and a patient. Although this therapeutic relationship is of central importance for mental health care, it appears to be relatively neglected in psychiatric research. Empirical research has for the most part adopted concepts and methods developed in psychotherapy and general medical practice. Hence, unpacking the presuppositions that have informed research on the therapeutic relationship to date maybe a useful first step in developing this field. Method. A review of the literature was carried out. Results: Six central theories are identified as framing the definitions and methods on this topic: role theory, psychoanalysis, social constructionism, systems theory, social psychology and cognitive behaviourism. To date, role theory, psychoanalysis and systems theory appear to be the frameworks most often applied in research in this field. Each perspective offers a unique emphasis in the analysis of the therapeutic relationship, which is reflected in the empirical work from each perspective discussed herein. Conclusions: None of the theories identified have been fully specified and comprehensively investigated in psychiatric settings. However, more than one approach may be used for thinking about relationships, depending on the treatment situation. Further specification and testing of the theories in psychiatric practice - taking account of the specific context - is warranted to underpin more pragmatic research. A stronger link between fundamental psychological and sociological research and applied health care research would advance our understanding of which elements of positive therapeutic relationships are instrumental in improving patient outcome and ultimately contribute to improving mental health care.

   Method. A computerized search of medical databases (for example, Medline and Embase), a manual searching of articles and textbooks, and the use of vignettes to highlight treatment issues.
   Results: There are limited data about the effectiveness and safety of psychotropic agents for youths with psychosis and scarce in.. formation about the drug treatment of the prodromal stage of early psychosis in all age groups. The available data are encouraging, although the newer agents are not without safety concerns.
   Conclusions. Despite the paucity of studies, there is a range of psychotropics that may be used in the early stages of psychotic illness in youths. Drug choice is influenced by several factors, including the clinical picture, side effect profile, and patient preference. In certain situations, the decision may be not to use medication.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a preferential loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the etiology of PD is unknown, major biochemical processes such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial inhibition are largely described. However, despite these findings, the actual therapeutics are essentially symptomatical and are not able to block the degenerative process. Recent histological studies performed on brains from PD patients suggest that nigral cell death could be apoptotic. However. since post-mortem studies do not allow precise determination of the sequence of events leading to this apoptotic cell death, the molecular pathways involved in this process have been essentially studied on experimental models reproducing the human disease. These latter are created by using neurotoxic compounds such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-1-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or dopamine (DA). Extensive study of these models have shown that they mimick, in vitro and in vivo, the histological and or the biochemical characteristics of PD and thus help to define important cellular actors of cell death presumably critical for the nigral degeneration. This review reports recent data concerning the biochemical and molecular apoptotic mechanisms underlying the experimental models of PD and correlates them to the phenomena occurring in human disease.

   Method: A systematic search was performed in Medline and the Science Citation Index Expanded (ISI) from the period 1987-2000. For sensitivity and specificity of the EPDS presented in each study, 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Positive and negative predictive values were estimated assuming prevalences of postpartum depression ranging from 5% to 20%.
   Results: Eighteen validation studies were identified. The study design varied between studies. The sensitivity and specificity estimates also varied: 65-100% and 49-100%, respectively. The confidence intervals were estimated to be wide. Our estimates suggest a lower positive predictive value in a normal population than in the validation study samples.
   Conclusion: Most studies show a high sensitivity of the EPDS. Because of the differences in study design and large confidence intervals, uncertainty remains regarding the comparability between the sensitivity and specificity estimates of the different EPDS versions.

AB  - Functional brain Imaging in humans has revealed task-specific increases in brain activity that are associated with various mental activities. In the same studies, mysterious, task-Independent decreases have also frequently been encountered, especially when the tasks of interest have been compared with a passive state, such as simple fixation or eyes closed. These decreases have raised the possibility that there might be a baseline or resting state of brain function involving a specific set of mental operations. We explore this possibility, including the manner in which we might define a baseline and the implications of such a baseline for our understanding of brain function.

AB  - Temperature-induced bleaching in symbiotic cnidarians is a result of the detachment and loss of host cells containing symbiotic algae. We tested the hypothesis that host cell detachment is evoked through a membrane thermotropic event causing an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+](i), which could then cause collapse of the cytoskeleton and perturb cell adhesion. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of plasma membranes from the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora damicornis labeled with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) revealed no membrane thermotropic event. In addition, intracellular imaging using Fura-2AM as well as labeling anemones with Ca-45 revealed no significant change in [Ca2+](i). However, bleaching could be evoked at ambient temperature with 25 mmoll(-1) caffeine without affecting [Ca2+](i). [Ca2+](i) could be altered with ionomycin in isolated host cells, but ionomycin could not induce bleaching in A. pulchella. As caffeine can affect levels of intracellular protein phosphorylation, the ability of other agents that alter intracellular levels of protein phosphorylation to evoke bleaching was investigated. The protein phosphatase inhibitor vanadate could induce bleaching in A. pulchella. Two-dimensional gels of P-32-labeled proteins from cold-shocked, caffeine-treated and control anemones show that both temperature shock and caffeine alter the array of phosphorylated host soluble proteins. We conclude that enidarian bleaching is linked to a temperature-induced alteration in protein phosphorylation.

AB  - What are the psychological, computational and neural underpinnings of language? Are these neurocognitive correlates dedicated to language? Do different parts of language depend on distinct neuracognitive systems? Here I address these and other issues that are crucial for our understanding of two fundamental language capacities: the memorization of words in the mental lexicon, and the rule-governed combination of words by the mental grammar. According to the declarative/procedural model, the mental lexicon depends on declarative memory and is rooted in the temporal lobe, whereas the mental grammar involves procedural memory and is rooted in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. I argue that the declarative/procedural model provides a new framework for the study of lexicon and grammar.

   Aims To review the literature on patient and nurse satisfaction with, and attitudes towards, depots.
   Method Asystematic search of Medline, Embase,PsycINFO,CINAHL and The Cochrane Library was undertaken, along with citation searches. Studies were selected if satisfaction/attitude data were described in the title or abstract and original data were included. Study quality was rated.
   Results The search produced 1374 articles; 22 articles met the inclusion criteria, 18 of which were cross-sectional surveys. Of the 12 studies with relevant data, 10 conveyed a positive opinion of depot medication. Five out of six studies comparing depot with oral medication showed patient preference for depot.
   Conclusions High-quality data examining patient and nurse attitudes regarding depot antipsychotics are sparse. What data there are show a positive attitude to depots from patients. Future randomised controlled trials should include satisfaction as an outcome.

AB  - Numerous diseases in benthic marine organisms have been recognized over the last decade. Here, a new disease (pathogen unknown) is described and quantified in space and time for Palythoa caribaeorum (Cnidaria, Zoanthidea) populations on the Sao Paulo coast, Brazil (23degrees S). The degree of environmental stress (moderate vs. high), depth and temporal variation (seasons, years) on the frequency of the disease was assessed by monitoring plots at two sites: Ponta Recife (continent) and Praia Portinho (Sao Sebastiao island), and at two depths per site (0.5-1.5 m and 2.5-4 m). The disease spread outward from within the colony in a circular pattern. A transverse section extending from normal to diseased tissue showed a progression from normal polyps to pale, swollen polyps, followed by remnant spicule-like structures, and finally fine black matter and bare substratum in the middle of the lesion. The disease occurred in one or more portions of the colony simultaneously. Disease frequency and total area infected increased significantly with colony size. Generally, the disease affected less than or equal to 5% of the total colony area, and occurred when gonad development was maximal. Therefore, 20.5% (n = 306), and 14.6% (n = 578) of the population was infected in two consecutive years, respectively. Disease exhibited higher rates during summer (tourist season) and fall, and decreased significantly in the winter with the presence of cool water. Factors associated with the increased instance of disease during the summer were higher temperatures, precipitation and sewage; the opposite was noted in the winter. Disease frequency varied significantly between years, seasons, sites and depths. Colonies exhibited higher disease frequency in Ponta Recife characterized by high levels of sedimentation, increased turbidity and low levels of incident light with respect to Praia Portinho. Colonies in shallow water exhibited greater frequency of disease compared to those in deeper water. Physiological stress, low energy input, energy expenditure and energy re-allocation may increase the susceptibility of P. caribaeorum colonies to disease. It is suggested that this disease may play an important role in the life history of P. caribaeorum because of its influence on partial mortality, colony area, population size structure, reproduction and ultimately fitness. This represents the first report of disease-related mortality in reef zoanthids of the Southwestern Atlantic.

   Method. Findings from refereed journal articles and current texts in the field are briefly summarized.
   Results: CD is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Factors strongly predictive of future delinquency include past offenses, antisocial peers, impoverished social ties, early substance use, male sex, and antisocial parents. Factors that moderately predict recidivism include early aggression, low socioeconomic status (SES), psychological variables such as risk taking and impulsivity, poor parent-child relationships, poor academic performance, early medical insult, and neuropsychological variables such as poor verbal IQ. Mildly predictive variables include other family characteristics such as large family size, family stress, discord, broken home, and abusive parenting, particularly neglect. Protective factors include individual factors such as skill competence (in social and other arenas), adult relationships, prosocial and proeducational values, and strong social programs and supports.
   Conclusions: We know a great deal about psychosocial risk factors for CD. Some research into protective factors and genetic contributions exists but is in its early stages. Future work will increase our knowledge about subtypes, developmental pathways, and CD treatment.

AB  - In the late 1970s, Premack and Woodruff asked whether chimpanzees had a theory of mind. The answer to this question has remained elusive. Whereas some authors argue that chimpanzees are capable of mental state attribution, others maintain that they simply learn certain cues in ertain situations. Recent studies challenge both views. On the one hand, chimpanzees know much more about seeing than cue-based explanations suggest; on the other hand, this knowledge does not necessarily entail understanding of the mental states of others. The hypothesis I put forward here is that chimpanzees learn cues in social situations but that they are also capable of knowledge abstraction to solve novel problems.

AB  - Background: Case management in its various forms represents a major innovation in mental health care. Its efficacy remains controversial.
   Aims: To update after a decade a previous review article (Holloway, 1991).
   Methods: Descriptive literature and controlled trials of case management and its derivative Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) was accessed through four comprehensive and systematic reviews of the literature, repeated Medline and Embase searches and personal contacts.
   Results and Conclusions: The concept of case management has continued to evolve over the past decade. No controlled trial has been published exploring the model of the case manager as a service broker without responsibility for the provision of care. Basic case management principles have frequently been incorporated within routine clinical practice. Published controlled trials of ACT, which were almost exclusively carried out in North America, have shown markedly positive results. However caution is required in extrapolating these findings to routine clinical practice within different systems of health and social care. Case management is not in itself an effective treatment for severe mental illness.

AB  - Traditionally, scientists and clinicians have explored peripheral physiological responses to acute hypoxia to explain the pathophysiological processes that lead to acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). After more than 100 years of investigation, little is yet known about the fundamental causes of the headache and nausea that are the main symptoms of AMS. Thus, we review the evidence supporting a change in focus to the role of the central nervous system in AMS. Our justification is (i) that the symptoms of AMS and HACE are largely neurological, (ii) that HACE is considered to be the end-stage of severe AMS and was recently identified as a vasogenic edema, opening the door for a role for blood-brain barrier permeability in AMS, (iii) that new, non-invasive techniques make measurement of brain water levels and cerebral blood volume possible and (iv) that the available experimental evidence and theoretical arguments support a significant role for brain swelling in the pathophysiology of AMS. We believe that an examination of the responses of the central nervous system to acute hypoxia will reveal important new pathophysiological processes that may help explain AMS and HACE.

AB  - Predominantly non-etiological conceptions have dominated the field of mental retardation (MR) since the discovery of the genetic etiology of Down syndrome (DS) in the sixties. However, contemporary approaches are becoming more etiologically oriented. Important differences across MR syndromes of genetic origin are being documented, particularly in the cognition and language domains, differences not explicable in terms of psychometric level. motivation, or other dimensions. This paper highlights the major difficulties observed in the oral language development of individuals with genetic syndromes of mental retardation. The extent of inter- and with-in-syndrome variability are evaluated. Possible brain underpinnings of the behavioural differences are envisaged. Cases-of atypically favourable language development in MR individuals are also summarized and explanatory variables discussed. It is suggested that differences in brain architectures, originating in neurological development. and having genetic origins, may largely explain the syndromic as well as the individual within-syndrome variability documented. Lastly, the major implications of the above points for current debates about modularity and developmental connectionism are spelt out.

AB  - Recent interest in the development and evolution of theory of mind has provided a wealth of information about representational skills in both children and animals, According to J, Perrier (1991), children begin to entertain secondary representations in the 2nd year of life. This advance manifests in their passing hidden displacement tasks, engaging in pretense and means-ends reasoning, interpreting external representations, displaying mirror self-recognition and empathic behavior, and showing an early understanding of "mind" and imitation. New data show a cluster of mental accomplishments in great apes that is very similar to that observed in 2-year-old humans. It is suggested that it is most parsimonious to assume that this cognitive profile is of homologous origin and that great apes possess secondary representational capacity. Evidence from animals other than apes is scant. This analysis leads to a number of predictions for future research.

AB  - Objective: To compare suicide rates with vs. without long-term lithium treatment in major affective disorders.
   Method: Broad searching yielded 22 studies providing suicide rates during lithium maintenance, 13 also provide rates without such treatment. Study quality was scored, between-study variance tested, and suicide rates on vs. off lithium examined by meta-analyses using random-effects regression methods to model risk ratios.
   Results: Among 5647 patients (33 473 patient-years of risk) in 22 studies, suicide was 82% less frequent during lithium-treatment (0.159 vs. 0.875 deaths/100 patient-years). The computed risk-ratio in studies with rates on/off lithium was 8.85 (95% CI, 4.12-19.1; P < 0.0001). Higher rates off-lithium were not accounted for by treatment-discontinuation.
   Conclusion: Suicide risk was consistently lower during long-term treatment of major affective illnesses with lithium in all studies in the meta-analysis, including the few involving treatment-randomization.

AB  - Research into methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity has experienced a resurgence in recent years. This is due to (1) greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying methamphetamine neurotoxicity, (2) its usefulness as a model for Parkinson's disease and (3) an increased abuse of the substance, especially in the American Mid-West and Japan. It is suggested that the commonly used experimental one-day methamphetamine dosing regimen better models the acute overdose pathologies seen in humans, whereas chronic models are needed to accurately model human long-term abuse. Further, we suggest that these two dosing regimens will result in quite different neurochemical, neuropathological and behavioral outcomes. The relative importance of the dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter knockout is discussed and insights into oxidative mechanisms are described from observations of nNOS knockout and SOD overexpression. This review not only describes the neuropathologies associated with methamphetamine in rodents, non-human primates and human abusers, but also focuses on the more recent literature associated with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and their contribution to neuronal death via necrosis and/or apoptosis. The effect of methamphetamine on the mitochondrial membrane potential and electron transport chain and subsequent apoptotic cascades are also emphasized. Finally, we describe potential treatments for methamphetamine abusers with reference to the time after withdrawal. We suggest that potential treatments cart be divided into three categories; (1) the prevention of neurotoxicity if recidivism occurs, (2) amelioration of apoptotic cascades that may occur even in the withdrawal period and (3) treatment of the atypical depression associated with withdrawal.

AB  - 'It should be clear that the upper temperature limit for life cannot be accurately defined' (Schmidt-Nielsen 1996). The thermal physiology of zooxanthellate reef corals is reviewed in this paper in the context of organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching, with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and algal symbiont stress. Coral bleaching, as presently defined in the literature, is a highly subjective term used to describe a variety of conditions pertaining to low symbiont densities in the coral-algal complex, including response to thermal stress. Three general types of high-temperature bleaching are defined: physiological bleaching, which may or may not include higher-than-normal temperature responses; algal-stress bleaching, involving dysfunction of symbiotic algae at high light and/or high temperatures; and animal-stress bleaching, where coral cells containing symbiotic algae are shed from the gastrodermal layer of cells. Since none of these methods of bleaching is mutually exclusive, a combination of intrusive and nonintrusive techniques is necessary to determine which mechanisms of symbiont loss are occurring. While quantification of symbiont densities, algal pigments, and coral tissue biomass provide unambiguous evidence of bleaching severity, measurements of physiological and biochemical degradation offer additional correlative evidence of temperature stress. Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry has emerged as an easy and relatively inexpensive non-invasive technique for monitoring symbiotic algal function both in situ and in the laboratory, when proper assumptions and interpretations are made. The roles of global warming, water quality, acclimation/adaptation processes, and relation to coral disease and reef heterogeneity are also discussed. A thorough understanding of the organismal responses occurring during bleaching will help explain changes in coral populations and in the coral reef community, and perhaps assist in predicting the future of reef corals and coral reefs during the next century of global climate change.

AB  - Objective: Alcohol use disorders and other substance use disorders are extremely common among patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article reviews studies pertaining to the epidemiology, clinical phenomenology, and pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders.
   Method: Studies were identified by means of computerized and manual searches. The review of research on the pathophysiology of PTSD and substance use disorders was focused on studies of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the noradrenergic system.
   Results: High rates of comorbidity suggest that PTSD and substance use disorders are functionally related to one another. Most published data support a pathway whereby PTSD precedes substance abuse or dependence. Substances are initially used to modify PTSD symptoms. With the development of dependence, physiologic arousal resulting from substance withdrawal may exacerbate PTSD symptoms, thereby contributing to a relapse of substance use. Preclinical work has led to the proposal that in PTSD, corticotropin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic systems may interact such that the stress response is progressively augmented. Patients may use sedatives, hypnotics, or alcohol in an effort to interrupt this progressive augmentation.
   Conclusions: Vigorous control of withdrawal and PTSD-related arousal symptoms should be sought during detoxification of patients with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders. Inclusion of patients with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders in neurobiologic research and in clinical trials will be critical for development of effective treatments for this severely symptomatic patient population.

AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed the risks and benefits regarding the use of psychiatric medications during breast-feeding as they relate to the health and well-being of mothers and their infants. Strategies are discussed to limit infant exposure to a medication while effectively treating the nursing mother.
   Method: A MEDLINE search of the literature since 1955 was conducted to determine the use of psychotropic medications in breast-feeding women. Search items included each of the categories of psychopharmacologic agents as well as each of the agents in association with nursing, breast-feeding, postpartum, lactation, and breast milk.
   Results: No controlled studies on the safety of psychotropic medications in nursing mothers were found. Case reports and small case series for each of the different psychotropic medications serve as the basis for suggested treatment guidelines for the management of psychiatric illnesses in breast-feeding women. Thus, each case needs to be considered on an individual basis, with a thoughtful analysis of the risks and benefits of nursing and exposure of the infant to medication. The baseline clinical status of the infant should also be reviewed.
   Conclusions: Women are vulnerable postpartum to psychiatric disorders and frequently face the need to decide whether to take psychotropic medications while breast-feeding. Should psychiatric medication be indicated, the parents should be provided with the available information regarding the effects of these medications on the neonate. In this way, an informed decision can be made. When psychotropic medication is used during breast-feeding, it is strongly recommended that the infant's pediatrician be involved in monitoring the infant.

AB  - Disturbances of sleep are typical for most depressed patients and belong to the core symptoms of the disorder. Polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity, in depression sleep is characterized by a reduction of slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep, with a shortening of REM latency, a prolongation of the first REM period and increased REM density. These findings have stimulated many sleep studies in depressive patients and patients with other psychiatric disorders. In the meantime, several theoretical models, originating from basic research, have been developed to explain sleep abnormalities of depression, like the two-process-model of sleep and sleep regulation, the GRF/CRF imbalance model and the reciprocal interaction model of non-REM and REM sleep regulation. Interestingly, most of the effective antidepressant agents suppress REM sleep. Furthermore, manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle, like sleep deprivation or a phase advance of the sleep period, alleviate depressive symptoms. These data indicate a strong bi-directional relationship between sleep, sleep alterations and depression. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

This paper explores why patients may respond to crowding with violence. Method: We carried out a literature review on Medline, using the key words "violence" and "crowding." We conducted an additional hand search of the references collected from the reviewed papers. Results: Factors specific to the relation between crowding on acute-care impatient psychiatric wards and violence can be divided under the following headings: 1)patient density, privacy, and control; 2) ward architecture; 3) the social organization of psychiatric wards; 4) interpersonal space; 5) phylogenic theories; and 6) anthropological theories of human behaviour. Conclusions: We offer explanatory models for this relation and suggest strategies to counter the effects of crowding. Recommendations are made for future studies.

AB  - What makes it worthwhile to invest effort into a clinical problem? The problem must be common, demanding, or severe. The eating disorders live up to these specifications. Maybe eating disorders are not so common, but changes in attitudes toward care and the severity of these disorders present a severe burden for health care delivery Systems(46,) (54,) (71,) (90) and managed care.(68) These disorders are severe in many ways, carrying a considerable risk for emotional, psychosocial and sexual "stunting,"(68) and significant risks for morbidity(9,) (98,) (99) and mortality.(70) The fact that it is possible to die from starvation ought not to present any intellectual problems for people with a memory going some 50 years back or with an interest in newer history. This fact was the subject of a presentation by Eitinger(13) at the 1965 symposium in Gottingen, Germany.
   This article presents a transatlantic view of the epidemiology and mortality in the eating disorders to expand the field of vision a little beyond the DSM-IV2 and managed care.(19, 46, 106)

AB  - Objectives This study attempts to estimate the proportion of annual deaths related to occupational factors in Finland and considers related methodological issues and associated uncertainties.
   Methods statistics on causes of death, numbers of subjects exposed, and risk ratios obtained from the epidemiologic literature were used to estimate the population attributable fraction and disease burden for causes of death from work-related diseases. Gender-, age- and disease-specific numbers of deaths were provided by Statistics Finland for 1996. Information on the size of the population, broken down by gender, age, occupation, and industry, was acquired from population censuses. A Finnish job-exposure matrix supplied data on the prevalence of exposure for specific agents and the level of exposure among exposed workers.
   Results The attributable fraction of work-related mortality in the relevant disease and age categories was estimated to be 7% (10% for men and 2% for women), and far all diseases and ages the fraction was 4%. For the main cause-of-death categories, the attributable fraction became 12% for circulatory system diseases, 8% for malignant neoplasms, 4% for respiratory system diseases, 4% for mental disorders, 3% for nervous system diseases, and 3% for accidents and violence. The following estimates were obtained for specific important diseases: 24% for lung cancer, 17% for ischemic heart disease, 12% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 11% for stroke. Based on these fractions, the total number of work-related deaths that occurred in Finland in 1996 was calculated to be on the order of 1800 (employed work force of 2.1 million); 86% involved men.
   Conclusions High-quality epidemiologic studies and national survey data are essential for obtaining reliable estimates of the proportion of deaths attributable to occupational factors. The magnitude of work-related mortality is an insufficiently recognized contributor to total mortality in Finland, especially from circulatory diseases and other diseases caused by exposure to agents other than asbestos.

Initial models were developed by using toxins that specifically targeted dopamine neurons, the most successful of which used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a toxin that causes parkinsonism in man. More recently, the identification of alpha -synuclein mutations as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease has led to the development of alpha -synuclein transgenic mice and Drosophila. Here, I discuss the merits and limitations of these different animal models in our attempts to understand the physiology of Parkinson's disease and to develop new therapies.

TI  - Soul space: the pastoral care of people with major mental health problems
AB  - This paper builds upon the long and complex history of pastoral care and its roots in religious and theological theory and practice. Then it traces the influence of the human sciences and especially psychology and psychotherapy, which have had a major impact on practice in the mental health field in the last 50 years. The modern pastoral care movement has embraced the theories a hermeneutics and the central part of the paper applies one of these theories to the pastoral care of people with severe mental health problems. It recognizes the major contribution that users and survivors of mental health services have to make to their own soul care and the ambivalence to this which they encounter from society and religious and psychiatric professions. The paper concludes with some examples of good practice which recognize and use the different perspectives of users, mental health and religious professionals. These offer the best way forward for effective pastoral care for those who are served by and those who work in mental health services.

AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed published research that compared partial and full hospitalization as alternative programs for the care of mentally ill adults, with the goal of both systematizing the knowledge base and providing directions for future research.
   Method: Studies published since 1950 were obtained through manual and electronic searches. Results were stratified by outcome domain, type of measure used to report between-group differences (global, partial, or rate-based), and time of assessment. Effect sizes were computed and combined within a random-effects framework.
   Results: Eighteen investigations published between 1957 and 1997 were systematically reviewed. Over half of eligible patients were excluded a priori; diagnostic severity of enrollees varied widely. On measures of psychopathology, social functioning, family burden, and service utilization, the authors found no evidence of differential outcome in the selected patient population admitted to the studies reviewed. Rates of satisfaction with services suggested an advantage for partial hospitalization within 1 year of discharge, with the gap being largest at 7-12 months.
   Conclusions: Although partial hospitalization is not an option for all patients requiring intensive services, outcomes of partial hospitalization patients in these studies were no different from those of inpatients. Further, patients and families were more satisfied with partial hospitalization in the short term. Weaknesses of the studies limited the scope of our inquiry and the generalizability of findings. Positive findings require replication under the present circumstances of mental health care, and more research is needed to identify predictors of differential outcome and successful partial hospitalization. A clearer definition of partial hospitalization will help consolidate its role in the continuum of mental health services.

Research its hindered by the difficulties of modelling a disorder of higher cognitive functions in animals. Depression can be understood as the interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors; however, current classifications are purely descriptive. The complexity of this field is best approached by rigorous explorations of known candidate systems in conjunction with the use of genomic: tools to discover new targets for antidepressants and to predict therapeutic outcomes.

   Methods: In addition to manual searches, Medline, Current Contents and Psych Info databases were searched for relevant publications.
   Results: On the evidence of an extensive body of research, so far biological correlates of social phobia remain elusive. Furthermore, the majority of studies reveal by default that the neurobiological functioning of social phobics is very much like that of normal control subjects.
   Conclusion: The conceptual and methodological foundations underpinning the current research programme are discussed critically. Its main weaknesses were found to be: lack of theory to guide research and aid the interpretation of results, static comparisons between subject groups and analysis oblivious to great individual variations. Possibilities of alternative approaches to study the neurobiology of social phobia are raised. Among others, continuous and situation-specific measurement, subjects used as their own controls and neurobiological correlates of clinical improvement following psychotherapy are considered.

AB  - In the wake of the recent announcements that the human genome has been mapped, efforts to identify the genetic loci underlying personality function will grow and intensify. Much research has already been done in this area, but it has for the most part been limited to classical biometrical approaches designed to determine if personality has a heritable basis. These so-called "heritability" studies estimate how much of the individual differences in personality are attributable to genetic differences among people. Molecular-genetic approaches, on the other hand, are designed to identify specific putative loci, but have yielded mixed results. The inconsistency in research findings can be attributed in part to the lack of sufficient numbers of genetic markers in the chromosomal regions of interest-a problem that the creation of a map of the human genome will help to rectify,. This map and its inevitable refinements, however can only advance the search for the genes for personality to a limited degree. Serious unresolved problems in the conceptualization and definition of personality and its dysfunction remain, which will hamper the search for personality genes.

AB  - Little is known about the underlying dimensions of impaired recognition of emotional prosody that is frequently observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Because patients with PD also suffer from working memory deficits and impaired time perception. the present study examined the contribution of (a) working memory (frontal executive functioning) and (b) processing of the accustic parameter speech rate to the perception of emotional prosody in PD. Two acoustic parameters known to be important for emotional classifications (speech duration and pitch variability) were systematically varied in prosodic utterances. Twenty pa with PD and 16 healthy controls (matched for age, sex, and IQ) participated in the study. The findings imply that (1) working memory dysfunctions and perception of emotional prosody are not independent in PD. (2) PD and healthy control subjects perceived vocal emotions categorically along two acoustic manipulation continua, and(3) patients with PD show impairments in processing of speech rats information.

AB  - Cortical glutamatergic and nigral dopaminergic afferents impinge on projection spiny neurons of the striatum, providing the most significant inputs to this structure. Isolated activation of glutamate or dopamine (DA) receptors produces short-term effects on striatal neurons, whereas the combined stimulation of both glutamate and DA receptors is able to induce long-lasting modifications of synaptic excitability. Repetitive stimulation of corticostriatal fibres causes a massive release of both glutamate and DA in the striatum and, depending on the glutamate receptor subtype preferentially activated, produces either long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission. D1-like and D2-like DA receptors interact synergistically to allow LTD formation, while they operate in opposition during the induction phase of LTP. Corticostriatal synaptic plasticity is severely impaired after chronic DA denervation and requires the stimulation of DARPP-32, a small protein expressed in dopaminoceptive spiny neurons which acts as a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. In addition, the formation of LTD and LTP requires the activation of PKG and PKA, respectively, in striatal projection neurons. These kinases appear to be stimulated by the activation of D1-like receptors in distinct neuronal populations.

AB  - Over the last few Sears, spinal injuries have been classified depending upon their causative mechanism and on the basis of three column concept of the structure of vertebral column. The concept of primary and secondary injury has laid more stress on prevention and treatment of secondary injury Methyl prednisolone still remains the drug of choice for prevention of secondary injury. Spinal injury involves all organ systems of the body depending on the level of lesion. Immobilisation of injured spine and maintenance of adequate airway after spinal injury need immediate attention. Orotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia, with manual in-line traction, is still considered the best method. Hypotension, hypertension and hyperglycaemia should be avoided during anaesthesia. Care should be taken to avoid effects of autonomic hyper reflexia. Spinal cord functions should be monitored and, if required, induced hypotension can be used with adequate monitoring.

AB  - The ability of metal chelating agents to prevent neuronal death caused by intra-hippocampal injections of cupric sulphate, ferric citrate and zinc chloride was investigated. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate was itself toxic after injection into the hippocampus, but this toxicity was reduced by formation of a metal ion/tetrathiomolybdate complex with Cu2+. Disodium bathocuproine disulphonate (BCDS) prevented neuronal death caused by Cu+2, but not that induced by Fe+3 or Zn+2. Desferrioxamine prevented death caused by Fe+3, had no significant effect of the toxicity of Zn+2 and increased that caused by Cu+2. Even though N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) has a higher affinity for Cu+2 than for Zn+2, TPEN had no effect on the toxicity of Cu+2 while totally preventing damage caused by Fe+3 or Zn+2. Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) prevented the toxicity of all three metal ions. Motor seizure activity occurred in most rats after injections of Fe+3; or combinations of Cu+2 plus TPEN, or 4 nmol Fe+3 plus 0.1 nmol desferrioxamine. However, apart from the low dose desferrioxamine/Fe+3 combination, only the occasional brain contained seizure-induced neuronal loss in limbic regions outside the injected hippocampus, and these brains were not used for analysis. Seizure activity was found even with very low levels of Cu+2 with a fixed amount of TPEN (a ratio of Cu+2/TPEN of 1:100), but the extent of hippocampal damage in these brains was not significantly different to that caused by injections of saline. These studies demonstrate that idiosyncratic interactions can occur between metal ions and chelating agents. Thus further investigations are needed before chelating agents can be examined for their protective properties in various neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Psycholinguistics is the empirical and theoretical study of the mental faculty that underpins our consummate linguistic agility. This review takes a broad look ar how the field has developed, from the turn of the 20th century through to the turn of the 21st. Since the linguistic revolution of the mid-1960s, the field has broadened ro encompass a wide range of copies and disciplines. A selection of these is reviewed here, starting with a brief overview of the origins of psycholinguistics. More detailed sections describe the language abilities of newborn infants; infants' lat er abilities as they acquire their first words and develop their first grammatical skills; the representation and access of words (both spoken and written) in the mental lexicon; the representations and processes implicated in sentence processing and discourse comprehension; and finally, the manner in which, as we speak, we produce words and sentences. Psycholinguistics is as much about the study of the human mind itself as it is about the study of that mind's ability to communicate and comprehend.

AB  - Objective: The authors sought to update the randomized controlled trial literature of psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia.
   Method: Computerized literature searches were conducted to identify randomized controlled trials of Various psychosocial interventions, with emphasis on studies published since a previous review of psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia in 1996.
   Results: Family therapy and assertive community treatment have clear effects on the prevention of psychotic relapse and rehospitalization. However, these treatments have no consistent effects on other outcome measures (e.g., pervasive positive and negative symptoms, overall social functioning, and ability to obtain competitive employment). Social skills training improves social skills but has no clear effects on relapse prevention, psychopathology, or employment status. Supportive employment programs that use the place-and-train vocational model have important effects on obtaining competitive employment. Some studies have shown improvements in delusions and hallucinations following cognitive behavior therapy. Preliminary research indicates that personal therapy may improve social functioning.
   Conclusions: Relatively simple, long-term psychoeducational family therapy should be available to the majority of persons suffering from schizophrenia. Assertive community training programs ought to be offered to patients with frequent relapses and hospitalizations, especially if they have limited family support. Patients with schizophrenia can clearly improve their social competence with social skills training, which may translate into a more adaptive functioning in the community. For patients interested in working, rapid placement with ongoing support offers the best opportunity for maintaining a regular job in the community. Cognitive behavior therapy may benefit the large number of patients who continue to experience disabling psychotic symptoms despite optimal pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Research on individual differences in mental abilities is discussed from three viewpoints: the psychometric structure of ability differences, the predictive validity of mental test scores, and some putative causes of psychometric intelligence differences in terms of psychometric and cognitive components and biological indices. A hierarchical descriptive structure for mental ability differences, as it emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, prominently displays British discoveries and suggestions, especially those of Spearman, Burt and P. E. Vernon from the first half of the 20th century. Galton and Spearman's largely unproductive search for the origins of ability differences has seen new activity since the 1970s, and there are several replicable associations that are yet to be explained. Over the 20th century the emphasis has been on measuring mental ability differences; at its beginning there was an emphasis (largely British) on understanding psychometric intelligence. The new century is likely to see a continuation of this re-emphasis on explaining human ability differences.

AB  - Objective: Australia's National Mental Health Strategy aims to achieve improved consumer outcomes. The development and refinement of consumer outcome measures is targeted within the Second National Mental Health Plan. The National Standards for Mental Health Services identify measures of functioning, quality of life and satisfaction with services as relevant to assessing and monitoring consumer outcome. Consumers have described gauging their own recovery through the achievement of functional goals in everyday life. This paper reviews how functioning is viewed within the mental health field, and implications for developing better functional outcome measures.
   Method: Literature describing the development of measures of functioning, principles of outcome measurement, and functional outcomes for people with severe mental illness was identified, using PsycLIT. A review yielded themes reflecting a number of assumptions about the concept of functioning.
   Results: Functioning is inadequately defined, raising issues about what is focused on, and from whose viewpoint, each of which has implications for using measures of functioning to monitor consumer outcome. Conflation of dissimilar functional domains, and flawed assumptions about the importance of symptomatology in influencing functional outcome limit the sensitivity to meaningful change of functional measures. Consumer perspectives are relatively neglected in functional tool development.
   Conclusions: A conceptual framework that recognizes lived experience and the interaction between persons and their environment is much needed to guide the development of functional outcome measures. Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies should be used to advance understanding of functioning and to address limitations of current approaches to functional outcome measurement.

AB  - Coral reef degradation resulting from nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is of increasing global concern. Although effects of nutrients on coral reef organisms have been demonstrated in the laboratory, there is little direct evidence of nutrient effects on coral reef biota in situ. The ENCORE experiment investigated responses of coral reef organisms and processes to controlled additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) on an offshore reef(One Tree Island) at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A multi-disciplinary team assessed a variety of factors focusing on nutrient dynamics and biotic responses. A controlled and replicated experiment was conducted over two years using twelve small patch reefs ponded at low tide by a coral rim. Treatments included three control reefs (no nutrient addition) and three + N reefs (NH4Cl added), three + P reefs (KH2PO4 added), and three + N + P reefs. Nutrients were added as pulses at each low tide (ca twice per day) by remotely operated units. There were two phases of nutrient additions. During the initial, low-loading phase of the experiment nutrient pulses (mean dose = 11.5 muM NH4+; 2.3 muM PO4-3) rapidly declined, reaching near-background levels (mean = 0.9 muM NH4+; 0.5 muM PO4-3) within 2-3 h. A variety of biotic processes, assessed over a year during this initial nutrient loading phase, were not significantly affected, with the exception of coral reproduction, which was affected in all nutrient treatments. In Acropora longicyathus and A. aspera, fewer successfully developed embryos were formed, and in A. longicyathus fertilization rates and lipid levels decreased. In the second, high-loading, phase of ENCORE an increased nutrient dosage (mean dose = 36.2 muM NH4+; 5.1 muM PO4-3 declining to means of 11.3 muM NH4+ and 2.4 muM PO4-3 at the end of low tide) was used for a further year, and a variety of significant biotic responses occurred. Encrusting algae incorporated virtually none of the added nutrients. Organisms containing endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (corals and giant clams) assimilated dissolved nutrients rapidly and were responsive to added nutrients. Coral mortality, not detected during the initial low-loading phase, became evident with increased nutrient dosage, particularly in Pocillopora damicornis. Nitrogen additions stunted coral growth, and phosphorus additions had a variable effect. Coral calcification rate and linear extension increased in the presence of added phosphorus but skeletal density was reduced, making corals more susceptible to breakage. Settlement of all coral larvae was reduced in nitrogen treatments, yet settlement of larvae from brooded species was enhanced in phosphorus treatments. Recruitment of stomatopods, benthic crustaceans living in coral rubble, was reduced in nitrogen and nitrogen plus phosphorus treatments. Grazing rates and reproductive effort of various fish species were not affected by the nutrient treatments. Microbial nitrogen transformations in sediments,were responsive to nutrient loading with nitrogen fixation significantly increased in phosphorus treatments and denitrification increased in all treatments to which nitrogen had been added. Rates of bioerosion and grazing showed no significant effects of added nutrients,
   ENCORE has shown that reef organisms and processes investigated ill situ were impacted by elevated nutrients. Impacts mere dependent on dose level, whether nitrogen and/or phosphorus mere elevated and were often species-specific. The impacts were generally sub-lethal and subtle and the treated reefs at the end of the experiment mere visually similar to control reefs. Rapid nutrient uptake indicates that nutrient concentrations alone are not adequate to assess nutrient condition of reefs. Sensitive and quantifiable biological indicators need to be developed for coral reef ecosystems. The potential bioindicators identified in ENCORE should be tested in future research on coral reef/nutrient interactions. Synergistic and cumulative effects of elevated nutrients and other environmental parameters, comparative studies of intact vs. disturbed reefs, offshore vs, inshore reefs, or the ability of a nutrient-stressed reef to respond to natural disturbances require elucidation. An expanded understanding of coral reef responses to anthropogenic impacts is necessary, particularly regarding the subtle, sub-lethal effects detected in the ENCORE studies.

AB  - The overall goal of this target article is to demonstrate a mechanism for an embodied cognition. The particular vehicle is a much-studied, but still widely debated phenomenon seen in 7-12 month-old-infants. In Piaget's classic "A-not-B error," infants who have successfully uncovered a toy at location "A" continue to reach to that location even after they watch the toy hidden in a nearby location "B." Here, we question the traditional explanations of the error as an indicator of infants' concepts of objects or other static mental structures. Instead, we demonstrate that the A-not-B error and its previously puzzling contextual variations can be understood by the coupled dynamics of the ordinary processes of goal-directed actions: looking, planning, reaching, and remembering. We offer a formal dynamic theory and model based on cognitive embodiment that both simulates the known A-not-B effects and offers novel predictions that match new experimental results. The demonstration supports an embodied view by casting the mental events involved in perception, planning, deciding, and remembering in the same analogic dynamic language as that used to describe bodily movement, so that they may be continuously meshed. We maintain that this mesh is a pre-eminently cognitive act of "knowing" not only in infancy but also in everyday activities throughout the life span.

AB  - Over the past two decades, mental retardation research converges on three general themes: co-occurring mental retardation and psychopathology; families of offspring with mental retardation; and the developmental approach regarding behavioral sequences and profiles. Intertwined with each theme is a mounting body of research on genetic mental retardation syndromes. We first review recent progress in each of the three domains-psychopathology, families, and development-based on studies of groups with heterogenous or nonspecific mental retardation. We then show how new findings from specific generic syndromes take this knowledge even further, as well as aid in the search for genetic, physiological, and environmental mechanisms associated with certain behaviors. We end the review by briefly summarizing our reasons for promoting an etiological approach to future mental retardation research, as well as by discussing methodological and other challenges.

AB  - The aims of this systematic literature review are to describe the pattern of attributions made for the causes of heart disease, and to determine how this pattern varies with the method by which attributions are elicited, and the respondent group.
   A search yielded 47 papers and reports, containing 54 datasets. Lifestyle factors and chronic stress were the most common causes cited across all datasets. Attributions to stressors and fate or luck were more likely to be reported in studies that used interval raring scales than in studies that used dichotomous ratings. Cardiac patients were more likely to mention stressors and fate or luck as causes of heart disease; non-patients rated being overweight and hypertensive as more important.
   The differences observed between the responses of patients and non-patients may be due to actor - observer differences, or to a methodological difference: patients are often asked to report their own experiences whereas non-patients are asked about the general case.

AB  - The science of reading and developmental dyslexia has experienced spectacular advances during the last few years. Five aspects of this research are discussed in the article. (1) The holistic phenomenon of reading is complex. Many lower-level psychological processes (e.g., phonemic awareness, phonological decoding, ability to process stimuli rapidly and automatize this process, memory, ability to recognize words) contribute to a single act of reading. Conceptualizing the complex process of reading through its partly overlapping but partly independent components-which contribute to, but do not fully explain, the holistic process of reading-provides an excellent model for understanding complex hierarchies of higher mental functions. Those who master reading skills successfully and those who have difficulties doing so differ in a wide range of reading-related processes. The central deficit experienced by poor readers appears to be related to phonological processing (a complex hierarchy of functions related to processing phonemes), whereas characteristics of automatization processes seem to moderate the reading outcome for people whose phonological skills are weak. (2) There are new data addressing models of dyslexia in languages other than English. The most fascinating finding is that the model implicating phonological deficit as central to dyslexia, and the lack of ability to automatize as leading to troubled reading, appears to be universal, regardless of the specific language. However, there is an interaction effect between the characteristics of a particular language and the developmental model of dyslexia. In phonologically more difficult languages (e.g., English): the most pronounced weakness appears to occur in phonological processing, whereas in phonologically easier languages (e.g., German), the crucial role in the manifestation of dyslexia is played by the lack of the skills needed to achieve automatization. (3) There is abundant evidence that reading (i.e., any single act of reading as well as reading as a holistic process) is "cooked" by the brain. Although no unified brain map of reading has been developed, some specific areas of the brain have been implicated in different reading-related cognitive processes by different laboratories and on different samples. (4) Indisputable evidence has been accumulated suggesting the involvement of the genome in developmental dyslexia. As of now, specific regions of the genome have been identified as being intimately involved with a number of different reading-related processes. Today the field of developmental dyslexia is the only area of genetic studies of human abilities and disabilities in which linkages to the genome have been robustly replicated in independent laboratories. (5) Finally, evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia might be only one of the manifestations of a deep, underlying, anatomical syndrome. The comorbidity of developmental dyslexia with both internalizing and externalizing behavioral disturbances, as well as with other learning disabilities, underscores the need for wide-ranging cognitive and behavioral approaches in the remediation programs offered to dyslexic children.

AB  - The effects of pesticides on zooplankton are reviewed and their ecological significance is discussed. Toxicity is shown to vary depending on animal species, genotype, life stage, and size at birth. Natural stresses such as food shortage, oxygen depletion and odors of potential predators call also affect toxicity. Populations in the growth phase are vulnerable to pesticides but have the potential to recover rapidly from the damage. Pesticides may affect the population dynamics by controlling individual survival and reproduction, and by altering the sex ratio. Furthermore, toxic chemicals may control predation risk by changing swimming behavior and body morphology, and this in turn influences the population dynamics. Many zooplankton display morphological and behavioral responses to predators when exposed to their odor-producing chemicals. However, pesticides induce a maladaptive response to predator odor, and this poses an ecological risk. The following patterns are recognized as effects of pesticides at the community and ecosystem levels: (1) induction of dominance by small species; (2) an increase of species richness and diversity; and (3) elongation of the food chain and reduction of energy transfer efficiency from primary producers to top predators.

AB  - This report was prepared by the Center for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the Institute for Health and Productivity Management as Dart of an effort to improve understanding of the connection between employee health and performance and to begin to identify new strategies through which treating health as an investment in human capital can lead to greater business success. Computer database searches of peer-reviewed literature published between 1993 and 1998 and manual reviews of 20 journals were used to identify research on the link between employee health and performance. Data was extracted to summarize the overall findings on the magnitude of health problems addressed by health promotion and disease prevention programs, and the impact of interventions on improving health risk, reducing medical care cost, and improving worker performance. From this summary major conclusions on early detection of disease, the impact of behavior change programs, and appropriate care-seeking were drawn. This systematic review is supplemented with summaries of 15 seminal articles and descriptions of five leading-practices programs. The influence of developments in work/family issues, complementary and alternative medicine, and quality of care and health outcomes research are briefly discussed. Finally, a conceptual framework for studying the impact of health and productivity is described.

AB  - Much of the functioning of the motor system occurs without awareness. Nevertheless, we are aware of some aspects of the current state of the system and we can prepare and make movements in the imagination. These mental representations of the actual and possible states of the system are based on two sources: sensory signals from skin and muscles, and the stream of motor commands that have been issued to the system. Damage to the neural substrates of the motor system can lead to abnormalities in the awareness of action as well as defects in the control of action. We provide a framework for understanding how these various abnormalities of awareness can arise. Patients with phantom limbs or with anosognosia experience the illusion that they can move their limbs. We suggest that these representations of movement are based on streams of motor commands rather than sensory signals. Patients with utilization behaviour or with delusions of control can no longer properly link their intentions to their actions. In these cases the impairment lies in the representation of intended movements. The location of the neural damage associated with these disorders suggests that representations of the current and predicted state of the motor system are in parietal cortex, while representations of intended actions are found in prefrontal and premotor cortex.

AB  - objective: In 1970, Guze acid Robins published a meta-analysis of suicide in patients with affective illness that inferred a lifetime risk of 15%. Since then, this figure has been generalized to all depressive disorders and cited uncritically in many papers and textbooks. The authors argue for an alternative estimate of suicide risk and question the generalizability of the Guze and Robins estimate.
   Method: The authors sorted studies obtained through a literature search that included data pertaining to suicide occurrence in affective illness into one of three groups: outpatients, inpatients, or suicidal inpatients. Suicide risks were calculated meta-analytically for these three groups, as well as for two previously published collections.
   Results: There was a hierarchy in suicide risk among patients with affective disorders. The estimate of the lifetime prevalence of suicide in those ever hospitalized for suicidality was 8.6%. For affective disorder patients hospitalized without specification of suicidality, the lifetime risk of suicide was 4.0%. The lifetime suicide prevalence for mixed inpatient/outpatient populations was 2.2%, and for the nonaffectively ill population, it was less than 0.5%.
   Conclusions: The percentage of subjects dead due to suicide (case fatality prevalence) is a more appropriate estimate of suicide risk than the percentage of the dead who died by suicide (proportionate mortality prevalence). More important, it is well established that patients with affective disorders suffer a higher risk of suicide relative to the general population. However, no risk factor, including classification of diagnostic subtype, has been reliably shown to predict suicide. This article demonstrates a hierarchy of risk based on the intensity of the treatment setting. Given that patients with a hospitalization history, particularly when suicidal, have a much elevated suicide prevalence over both psychiatric outpatients and nonpatients, the clinical decision to hospitalize in and of itself appears to be a useful indicator of increased suicide risk.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are a frequent complication of depressive disorders and their treatment. Familiarity with the interaction among sleep, depression, and antidepressant medications may assist the clinician in selecting agents to suit the needs of individual patients. The authors review the current knowledge of changes in sleep architecture associated with particular antidepressant agents and with depressive illness, as well as the theoretical relevance of such changes to the antidepressant effect. Articles for review were found through a Medline search on the terms "polysomnography," "sleep," "antidepressants," and "insomnia" in English-language papers published from 1966 through March 2000. Additional articles were found in the reference lists of relevant papers.

AB  - Predicted changes in climate have raised concerns about potential impacts on terrestrial forest ecosystem productivity, biogeochemical cycling, and the availability of water resources. This review summarizes characteristics of drought typical to the major forest regions of the United States, future drought projections, and important features of plant and forest community response to drought. Research needs and strategies for coping with future drought are also discussed. Notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the magnitude and direction of future climate change, and the net impact on soil water availability to forests, a number of conclusions can be made regarding the sensitivity of forests to future drought. The primary response will be a reduction in net primary production and stand water use, which are driven by reductions in stomatal conductance. Mortality of small stature plants (i.e. seedlings and saplings) is a likely consequence of severe drought. In comparison, deep rooting and substantial reserves of carbohydrates and nutrients make mature trees less susceptible to water limitations caused by severe or prolonged drought. However, severe or prolonged drought may render even mature trees more susceptible to insects or disease. Drought-induced reductions in decomposition rates may cause a buildup of organic material on the forest floor, with ramifications for fire regimes and nutrient cycling. Although early model predictions of climate change impacts suggested extensive forest dieback and species migration, more recent analyses suggest that catastrophic dieback will be a local phenomenon, and changes in forest composition will be a relatively gradual process. Better climate predictions at regional scales, with a higher temporal resolution (months to days), coupled with carefully designed, field-based experiments that incorporate multiple driving variables (e.g. temperature and CO2), will advance our ability to predict the response of different forest regions to climate change.

AB  - Currently, personality theory and clinical psychology have a fairly substantial tradition of promoting a strongly scientific basis for clinical work and theorizing. However, an appropriate foundation model has been difficult to identify and establish. A theory of human operations, here proposed, may provide such an elementary model. The theory is rooted in the organizational and industrial field known as operations, which is a highly systematic, precise, flexible, scientific approach to the understanding and management of human goal-seeking action in the broadest sense. The proposed model includes the classical humanistic, clinical, and decision theoretic notions of values, cognition, emotions, ego, behavior, objectives, outcomes, feedback, and defenses. These notions are placed within an overall operations frame of reference and developed in such a manner that they can be used to assess human clinical problems and to design therapeutic interventions. The strengths and limitations of the model are discussed.

This article provides a context for furthering preventative efforts within counseling psychology specifically aimed at ending and/or mitigating the effects of male violence against women. A brief discussion of social and cultural considerations in prevention is presented. Suggestions for involvement at five levels of prevention (stopping male violence from ever occurring; delaying the onset of abusive behavior reducing the impact of men's violence; strengthening knowledge, attitudes and behavior promoting healthy relationships; and supporting institutional policies that promote healthy relationships) are provided. Future directions in training, funding, research, and employment for the counseling field are suggested.

AB  - A number of taxonomically diverse species of araneoid spiders adorn their orb-webs with conspicuous silk structures, called decorations or stabilimenta. The function of these decorations remains controversial and several explanations have been suggested, These include: (1) stabilising and strengthening the web; (2) hiding and concealing the spider from predators; (3) preventing web damage by larger animals, such as birds; (4) increasing foraging success; or (5) providing a sunshield. Additionally, they may have no specific function and are a consequence of stress or silk regulation. This review evaluates the strength of these explanations based on the evidence. The foraging function has received most supporting evidence, derived from both correlative field studies and experimental manipulations. This contrasts with the evidence provided for other functional explanations, which have not yet been tested as extensively. A phylogenetic analysis of the difficult decoration patterns suggests that the different types of decorations are as evolutionary labile as the decorations themselves: the analysis shows little homology and numerous convergences and independent gains. Therefore, it is possible that different types of decorations have different functions: and this can only be resolved by improved species phylogenics, and a combination of experimental and ultimately comparative analyses.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) has classically been considered a disease of motor dysfunction, but it also includes psychiatric symptoms. To better understand the symptoms and signs that accompany PD, the interrelationships of deep brain structures and cortical areas involved with this neurodegenerative disease must be investigated. Current models of basal ganglia/cortical physiology attempt to integrate motor and nonmotor physiology and describe the pathophysiology attributable to PD. The cortical areas comprising basal ganglia/cortical loops include frontal structures involved in motor program as well as more prefrontal structures likely subserving non-motor functions such as cognition. The etiology of PD is not clear, but studies have implicated oxidative stress from exogenous stressors or endogenous neurotoxins. A large number of PD patients have been found to exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. Lewy bodies are seen within dopaminergic and other neuronal populations affected in PD, and they stain positive for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. The small percentage of familial PD has often been found to coincide with dominantly inherited mutations in the gene for alpha-synuclein, or with the recessive gene mutation for parkin, which is involved in the ubiquitination pathway. Selected neuronal populations are affected in PD, and the neurodegeneration may include dopaminergic neurons outside the substantia nigra pars compacta, as well and non-dopaminergic neurons. The loss of these neuronal populations within the basal ganglia-frontal circuits can have a profound effect upon the motor and neurobehavioral symptoms in PD. L-dopa remains the most effective pharmacologic therapy for PD, however as the disease progresses, the drug loses its efficacy and troublesome side-effects often occur. The renewal of surgical interventions for PD has increased the insight into the pathophysiology of PD, and surgical lesions have shown that motor and cognitive fronto-subcortical circuits are seemingly segregated in patients with PD. Investigation into these circuits helps provides models underlying motor and cognitive pathophysiology of PD.

   Results Systematic/structured risk assessment approaches may enhance the accuracy of clinical prediction of violent outcomes. Data on the predictive validity of available clinical risk assessment tools are based largely on American and North American studies and further validation is required in British samples. The Psychopathy Checklist appears to be a key predictor of violent recidivism in a variety of settings.
   Conclusions Violence risk prediction is an inexact science and as such will continue to provoke debate. Clinicians clearly need to be able to demonstrate the rationale behind their decisions on violence risk and much can be learned from recent developments in research on violence risk prediction.

AB  - The basal ganglia are thought to modulate the release or inhibition of movements by way of direct and indirect pathways that act as a push-pull system of cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Here we suggest a three-pathway model of the basal ganglia that takes into consideration the fundamental division of the striatum into striosomes and extrastriosomal matrix. We suggest that, in addition to the balance between direct and indirect pathways on which normal release of individual movements depends, the balance of activity between these matrix-based pathways and the striosomal pathway regulates the frequency of release of given behavioral sequences and, thus, modulates behavioral focus. Differential plasticity in these compartmentally organized circuits might contribute to the development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias under parkinsonian conditions and dopamine-receptor-agonist induced stereotypies under normal conditions.

AB  - This paper reviews over 100 publications of Charles N. ("Skip") Alexander. Skip theoretically showed that the four higher states of consciousness described by Maharishi's Vedic psychology logically extend the developmental sequence delineated by 20th century psychology. His empirical research found that the Transcendental Meditation(R) technique provides the direct experience of transcendental consciousness (the first higher state, which is the silent basis of the mind) and that this practice accelerates development in children, "unfreezes" development in prison inmates, advances ego development in adults, increases productivity in businesses, decreases blood pressure, increases longevity, effectively treats substance abuse, and reduces prison recidivism. Skip and colleagues were the first to discover the EEG signature of cosmic consciousness (the second higher state), and he showed that developmental advances in individuals impact the larger society via a common field of collective consciousness, including decreasing armed conflicts and improving the quality of life.

AB  - Objective: Improving knowledge about the cytochrome p450 system means that potential drug interactions can be predicted. Interactions involving warfarin may be thus avoidable. As many patients who have suffered from a stroke or other thromboembolic events may also develop psychiatric disorder, knowledge about possible interactions with psychotropics is essential for prescribers.
   Method: A Medline and hand search of published literature was complemented by contacting manufacturers.
   Results: The antidepressants citalopram, nefazodone and sertraline have relatively low interaction potential with warfarin; fluoxetine and fluvoxamine relatively high. Carbamazepine appears to reduce warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Other antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics have only a theoretical risk of interaction. Lithium, gabapentin, sulpiride and amisulpride are predominantly renally excreted and so are not likely to interact with warfarin.
   Conclusion: Many psychotropics are involved in predictable interactions with warfarin. Drugs with a known low interaction potential should be chosen instead of those known or predicted to interact.

AB  - Objective: The authors conducted a meta-analysis of relevant data from primary studies of the genetic epidemiology of major depression.
   Method: The authors searched MEDLINE and the reference lists of previous review articles to identify relevant primary studies. On the basis of a review of Family, adoption, and twin studies that met specific inclusion criteria, the authors derived quantitative summary statistics.
   Results: Five family studies met the inclusion criteria. The odds ratios for proband (subjects with major depression or comparison subjects) versus first-degree relative status (affected or unaffected with major depression) were homogeneous across the five studies (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio=2.84, 95% Cl=2.31-3.49). No adoption study met the inclusion criteria, but the results of two of the three reports were consistent with genetic influences on liability to major depression. Five twin studies met the inclusion criteria, and their statistical summation suggested that familial aggregation was due to additive genetic effects (point estimate of heritability of liability=37%, 95% Cl=31%-42%), with a minimal contribution of environmental effects common to siblings (point estimate=0%, 95% Cl=0%-5%), and substantial individual-specific environmental effects/measurement error (point estimate=63%, 95% Cl=58%-67%). The literature suggests that recurrence best predicts the familial aggregation of major depression.
   Conclusions: Major depression is a familial disorder, and its familiality mostly or entirely results from genetic influences. Environmental influences specific to an individual are also etiologically significant. Major depression is a complex disorder that does not result from either genetic or environmental influences alone but rather from both. These findings are notably consistent across samples and methods and are likely to be generally applicable.

AB  - Cost-effective psychotherapeutic interventions can enhance pharmacotherapy and improve outcomes in major depression and schizophrenia, but they are rarely studied in bipolar disorder, despite its often unsatisfactory response to medication alone. Following a literature search, we compiled and evaluated research reports on psychotherapeutic interventions in bipolar disorder patients. We found 32 peer-reviewed reports involving 1052 patients-14 studies on group therapy, 13 on couples or family therapy, and five on individual psychotherapy-all supplementing standard pharmacotherapy. Methodological limitations were common in these investigations. Nevertheless, important gains were often seen, as determined by objective measures of increased clinical stability and reduced rehospitalization, as well as other functional and psychosocial benefits. The results should further encourage rising international interest in testing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in these common, often severe and disabling disorders.

AB  - Mass spectrometry has been applied successfully to the study of non-enzymatic protein glycation, which is a topic of wide interest in the diabetes field Low- and high-resolution mass spectra, GC/MS, and collisional activation spectroscopy allow the structural identification and quantitative evaluation of advanced glycation end-products, which represent important molecules for monitoring diabetes. More recently available techniques, such as ESI and MALDI/MS, have had a significant impact on analytical problems in diabetes. In particular MALDI has been applied to the study of protein glycation in in vitro and in vivo conditions, because the number of glucose molecules that condense onto the protein can be easily determined by this approach. In the former case, glycation kinetics have been studied in various sugars and sugar concentrations, proteins, and buffer concentrations; in the latter comparisons of MALDI spectra of circulating proteins from healthy and diabetic subjects determine the exposure of patients to high glucose levels. The method has been applied to an evaluation of the glycation level of immunoglobulins, and indicates that glycation takes place preferentially on the Fab fragment of the protein, data are relevant in relating immunological impairment with glycation-induced changes in the functionality of immunoglobulins.

AB  - Tardive dyskinesia is a serious motor side effect of long-term treatment with neuroleptics, with an unknown pathophysiologic basis. Brain damage and aging are prominent risk-factors, and together with the persistent character of the disorder, it is likely that long-lasting neuronal changes are involved in the pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that striatal neurodegeneration caused by excitotoxic mechanisms and oxidative stress may play an important role in the development of the disorder, and the scope of the present work is to review the evidence supporting this hypothesis. The rat model of tardive dyskinesia has been used extensively in the field, and the usefulness of this model will be discussed. Neuroleptics are able to induce oxidative stress in vitro and increase striatal glutamatergic activity in rats, which may lead to toxic effects in the striatum. Drugs that block excitotoxicity inhibit the development of persistent oral dyskinesia in the rat model, and impaired energy metabolism leads to increased frequency of oral dyskinesia. There are also signs of altered striatal histology in rats with high frequency of oral dyskinesia. Furthermore, markers of increased oxidative stress and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with tardive dyskinesia, In conclusion, several lines of evidence implicate neurotoxic events in the development of neuroleptic induced tardive dyskinesia.

AB  - The choreutic conception of kinesthetic-motor space originally proposed by Rudolf Laban is given psychological validation through comparisons with similar conceptual models in spatial cognition and motor control research. Highly differentiated systems of reference are distinguished. Spatial paths are mentally represented as a series of locations linked into polygonal trajectories. Map-like images of the 'kinesphere' are structured with polyhedral networks. A fundamental practice consists of transforming spatial information with various operations (rotation, reflection, sizing, etc.). Loci are linked into spatial 'scales' which provide symmetrical solutions to geometric putties such as the traveling salesman problem and those devised by Hamilton (Icosian game) and filler (Koenigsberg bridge problem). In the body these are considered to be prototypes for spatial paths used during adjustments of dynamic equilibrium. The choreutic conception of polyhedral body space is especially similar to the trajectory formation model. The choreutic principal of topological forms deflecting across various kinespheric nets is analogous to N. Bernstein's description of the "net of the motor field . . . as oscillating like a cobweb in the wind." These commonalities indicate that further critical reviews of "choreutic laws" might be valuable in suggesting conceptual models and analytical tools for movement study in cognitive science.

AB  - In 1985, a WHO Working Group presented diagnostic criteria and a classification for solvent-induced chronic toxic encephalopathy (CTE). in the same year, the "Workshop on neurobehavioral effects of solvents" in Raleigh, N.C., USA introduced a somewhat different classification for CTE. The objective of this review is to study the diagnostic procedures that are used to establish the diagnosis of CTE, and the extent to which the diagnostic criteria and classification of the WHO, and the classification of the Raleigh Working Group, are applied. A systematic search of studies on CTE was performed, and the diagnostic criteria and use of the WHO and Raleigh classifications were listed. We retrieved 30 original articles published in English from 1985 to 1998, in which CTE was diagnosed. Only two articles did not report the duration of solvent exposure. The type of solvent(s) involved was described in detail in four articles, poorly in 17 articles, and not at all in nine articles. Tests of general intelligence were used in 19 articles, and tests of both attention and mental flexibility and of learning and memory were used in 18 articles. Exclusion, by interview, of potentially confounding conditions, such as somatic diseases with central nervous effects and psychiatric diseases, was reported in 21 and 16 articles, respectively. In only six of the articles were both the WHO diagnostic criteria and the WHO or Raleigh classifications used. In the future, parameters of exposure, psychological test results, and use of medication that possibly affects psychological test results should always be described. We list some advantages and disadvantages of the Raleigh and WHO classifications. To aid inter-study comparisons, the diagnosis of CTE should be categorized and reported according to an internationally accepted classification.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine neurons, leading to rigidity, slowness of movement, rest tremor, gait disturbances, and imbalance. Although there is effective symptomatic treatment for PD, there is no proven preventative or regenerative therapy. The etiology of this disorder remains unknown. Recent genetic studies have identified mutations in alpha-synuclein as a rare cause of autosomal dominant familial PD and mutations in parkin as a cause of autosomal recessive familial PD. The more common sporadic form of PD is thought to be due to oxidative stress and derangements in mitochondrial complex I activity. Understanding the mechanism by which familial linked mutations and oxidative stress cause PD has tremendous potential for unraveling the mechanisms of dopamine cell death in PD. In this article, we review recent advances in the understanding of the role of genetics and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of PD. (C) 2000 Academic Press

AB  - In this article, Professor Kennedy examines the tremendous increase in the severity of punishment in America in recent decades. He posits that criminal punishment has come to serve as a new civic religion of sorts for a society worried about its ability to cohere. The depth of our anxieties about our social solidarity, Kennedy argues, expresses itself in our monstrous conceptions of crime and in the corresponding severity of our punishment. His conclusion is that crime has come to serve as a rallying cry for a divided and insecure society, and that individuals and groups try to use punishment and the criminal justice system to send symbolic messages defining core values.

AB  - Since Darwin, the idea of psychological continuity between humans and other animals has dominated theory and research in investigating the minds of other species. Indeed, the field of comparative psychology was founded on two assumptions. First, it was assumed that introspection could provide humans with reliable knowledge about the causal connection between specific mental states and specific behaviors. Second, it was assumed that in those cases in which other species exhibited behaviors similar to our own, similar psychological causes were at work. In this paper. we show how this argument by analogy is flowed with respect to the case of second-order mental states. As a test case, we focus on the question of how other species conceive of visual attention, and in particular whether chimpanzees interpret seeing as a mentalistic event involving internal states of perception, attention, and belief. We conclude that chimpanzees do not reason about seeing in this manner, and indeed, there is considerable reason to suppose that they do not harbor representations of mental states in general. We propose a reinterpretation model in which the majority of the rich social behaviors that humans and other primates share in common emerged long before the human lineage evolved the psychological means of interpreting those behaviors in mentalistic terms. Although humans, chimpanzees, and most other species may be said to possess mental states, humans alone may have evolved a cognitive specialization for reasoning about such states.

AB  - Suicide is a major mental health problem in the United States and an issue that significantly impacts the mental health treatment community. Although the suicide rate remains relatively stable, the discipline of counseling psychology has broadened in scope and work settings have diversified. Thus, counseling psychology trainees are increasingly exposed to suicidal clients. Despite this reality research suggests that comprehensive, systematic training in suicidology in counseling psychology programs rarely occurs. One reason for this slate of affairs may be that the suicide literature is spread across a variety of disciplines, making it difficult for educators and practitioners to stay informed about the knowledge base in suicidology. The purpose of this contribution, therefore, is to provide counseling psychology educators and practitioners with an overview of the field of suicidology as it applies to the training and practice of counseling psychology.

AB  - Striatal neurones receive myriad of synaptic inputs originating from different sources. Massive afferents from all areas of the cortex and the thalamus represent the most important source of excitatory amino acids, whereas the nigrostriatal pathway and intrinsic circuits provide the striatum with dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, nitric oxide and adenosine. All these neurotransmitter systems interact each other and with voltage-dependent conductances to regulate the efficacy of the synaptic transmission within this nucleus. The integrative action exerted by striatal projection neurones on this converging information dictates the final output of the striatum to the other basal ganglia structures. Recent morphological, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological findings demonstrated that the striatum also contains different interneurones, whose role in physiological and pathological conditions represents an intriguing challenge in these years. The use of the in vitro brain slice preparation has allowed not only the detailed investigation of the direct pre- and postsynaptic electrophysiological actions of several neurotransmitters in striatal neurones, but also the understanding of their role in two different forms of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, long-term depression and long-term potentiation. These long-lasting changes in the efficacy of excitatory transmission have been proposed to represent the cellular basis of some fc,rms of motor learning and are altered in animal models of human basal ganglia disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The striatum also expresses high sensitivity to hypoxic-aglycemic insults. During these pathological conditions, striatal synaptic transmission is altered depending on presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release and opposite membrane potential changes occur in projection neurones and in cholinergic interneurones. These ionic mechanisms might partially explain the selective neuronal vulnerability observed in the striatum during global ischemia and Huntington's disease. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This paper summarises a report to the NHMRC the objectives of which were to review research into the epidemiology of youth suicide in Australia and identify gaps in research.
   Method: Literature searches were conducted. A limited amount of new data analysis was included to shed light on reliability issues of official Australian suicide data.
   Results: The review examined suicide data systems, including issues to do with coroners, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and alternative systems. The epidemiological areas reviewed included: all ages, youth, age and gender, geographical, socioeconomic, marital, indigenous, migrants, suicides in custody and gay and lesbian suicides.
   Conclusion: While much is known about the epidemiology of youth suicide, much remains to be clarified. Study of indigenous issues is perhaps the most neglected area; study of family issues may be potentially be the most productive.

AB  - Objective: Therapeutic strategies in depressed patients with no or partial response to adequate first-line antidepressant medication remain a matter of concern. This paper focuses on the strategy of dose increase.
   Method: This review was based on a systematic Medline search of papers dealing with antidepressant dose issues in major depression since the 1960s.
   Results: The strategy of dose increase is poorly studied in clinical trials.
   Conclusion: Until this strategy is better studied, caution is advised in its use. However, antidepressants for which this strategy seems tio be the most relevant are tricyclic drugs and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. These results are discussed both in terms of therapeutic strategies for the clinician and in terms of clinical research.

AB  - Cells throughout the rodent hippocampal system show place-specific patterns of firing called place fields, creating a coarse-coded representation of location. The dependencies of this place code-or cognitive map-on sensory cues have been investigated extensively, and several computational models have been developed to explain them. However, place representations also exhibit strong dependence on spatial and behavioral context, and identical sensory environments can produce very different place codes in different situations. Several recent studies have proposed models for the computational basis of this phenomenon, but it is still not completely understood. In this article, we present a very simple connectionist model for producing context-dependent place representations in the hippocampus. We propose that context dependence arises in the dentate gyrus-hilus (DGH) system, which functions as a dynamic selector, disposing a small group of granule and pyramidal cells to fire in response to afferent stimulus while depressing the rest. It is hypothesized that the DGH system dynamics has "latent attractors," which are unmasked by the afferent input and channel system activity into subpopulations of cells in the DG, CA3, and other hippocampal regions as observed experimentally. The proposed model shows that a minimally structured hippocampus-like system can robustly produce context-dependent place codes with realistic attributes.

AB  - Massive coral growth rates may be poor indicators of coral reef health where coral reefs are subject to combined eutrophication and sedimentation. Massive coral growth (vertical extension) rates on polluted reefs were not different from extension rates on unpolluted reefs, while live coral cover was low and bioerosion intensity high, leading to net reef erosion and death of the polluted reefs. These combined patterns of coral growth rates, coral cover and bioerosion were documented on reefs affected by land-based pollution in the Java Sea, South Sulawesi and Ambon, Indonesia. Acid-insoluble content in coral skeletons reflected land-based pollution stress on reefs more reliably than did coral extension rates. Coral skeletal density was lower on polluted Ja, a Sea reefs than on unpolluted reefs used as reference sites, but coral calcification rates,were not significantly different. The most eutrophied Java Sea reefs had net carbonate loss, indicating net reef erosion, while a fringing reef adjacent to mangroves and two unpolluted coral cays both had positive net carbonate production, Coral growth and reef growth were decoupled, in that coral growth rates did not reliably predict rates of reef accretion. The apparently paradoxical combination of normal to rapid coral growth and net reef erosion on polluted reefs illustrates the need for a whole-reef perspective on coral reef health.

AB  - We have previously shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is involved in spontaneous working memory and anxiety-related behaviour in CD-I mice, specifically, pretrial microinjection of the kappa, agonist, U-69,593, in the infralimbic (IL) area of the vmPFC produced a robust anxiolytic behavioural profile in the elevated plus-maze and enhanced spontaneous working memory in the Y-maze. In the present study we sought to determine whether these effects were specific to IL kappa receptors. We hypothesized that microinjection of the kappa antagonist, norBNI, in the IL cortex would influence anxiety and spontaneous memory in an opposite direction to the effects produced by the kappa(1) agonist. In week I, transfer-latency reference memory and anxiety were tested in the elevated plus-maze in two separate trials with an intertrial interval of 24 h. In week 2, spontaneous working memory was tested in the Y-maze followed immediately by defensive/withdrawal anxiety in the open field for one half of the animals in each group, and the other half was tested in reverse order. Pretreatment with one injection of vehicle, 1, 5 or 10 nmol/0.5 mu l norBNI in the IL cortex dose-dependently reduced transfer-latencies and produced an anxiogenic behavioural profile in the first elevated plus-maze trial. Following a 24 h delay, transfer-latency reference memory was not influenced, but a robust anxiogenic behavioural profile was observed in the second no-injection anxiety trial in the elevated plus-maze relative to control animals. In week 2, the same groups of mice were again pretreated with one injection of the same doses of norBNI in the IL cortex and tested in the open field and Y-maze. NorBNI pretreatment was anxiogenic in the defensive/withdrawal anxiety test and disrupted spontaneous working memory regardless of testing order. The present results show the influence of kappa receptor modulation on anxiety induction and spontaneous working memory. These results also support the hypothesis that immediate memory processing may modulate the induction of anxiety-related behaviours. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. AU rights reserved.

AB  - The functional neuroanatomy of speech perception has been difficult to characterize. Part of the difficulty, we suggest, stems from the fact that the neural systems supporting 'speech perception' vary as a function of the task. Specifically, the set of cognitive and neural systems involved in performing traditional laboratory speech perception tasks, such as syllable discrimination or identification, only partially overlap those involved in speech perception as it occurs during natural language comprehension. In this review, we argue that cortical fields in the posterior-superior temporal lobe, bilaterally, constitute the primary substrate for constructing sound-based representations of speech, and that these sound-based representations interface with different supramodal systems in a task-dependent manner. Tasks that require access to the mental lexicon (i.e. accessing meaning-based representations) rely on auditory-to-meaning interface systems in the cortex in the vicinity of the left temporal-parietal-occipital junction. Tasks that require explicit access to speech segments rely on auditory-motor interface systems in the left frontal and parietal lobes. this auditory-motor interface system also appears to be recruited in phonological working memory.

AB  - Despite a wide variety of emotions that can be subjectively experienced, the emotion space has consistently revealed a low dimensionality. The search for corresponding somato-visceral response patterns has been only moderately successful. The authors suggest a solution based on an assumed parallelism between emotion coding and color coding. According to the color detection model proposed by Sokolov and co-workers, neurons responsible for color detection are triggered by a combination of excitations in a limited number of input cells. Similarly, a limited number of input channels may feed complex emotion detectors being located on a hypersphere in a four-dimensional emotion space, the three angles of which correspond to emotional tone, intensity, and saturation, in parallel to hue, lightness, and saturation in color perception. The existence of such a four-dimensional emotion space in the subjective domain is shown by using schematic facial expressions as stimuli.
   A neurophysiological model is provided in which reticular, hypothalamic, and limbic structures constitute input channels of an emotion detecting system, thus acting as the first layer of emotion predetectors. Hypothalamic neurons with differential sensitivity for various transmitters may elicit a subsequent selective activation in a second layer of predetectors at the thalamic level. The latter are suggested to trigger emotion detectors located in cortical areas, the action of which should be revealed by measures of central nervous system activity. Preliminary results from evoked potential studies show that switching between schematic faces that express different emotions may be used as an objective measure for establishing a psychophysiological emotion space.

AB  - Relapse is a major characteristic of drug addiction, and remains the primary problem in treating drug abuse. Without an understanding of the factors that determine renewed drug-seeking, the urge to use drugs, and the persistent craving for them, it is unlikely that health care professionals can provide effective treatment, Using an animal model of relapse, the author and her team are studying factors that induce reinstatement of drug-taking behaviour after short and long periods of abstinence, and they are exploring the neurobiological basis of these effects. In their experiments, rats are trained to self-administer drugs intravenously by pressing 1 of 2 levers. During a subsequent period, the drug is no longer available, but the rats are free to try to obtain the drug (a period of "extinction training"). After extinction of responding, the investigators test for the ability of various events to reinitiate drug-seeking. On this background of renewed drug-seeking or relapse, the investigators search for pharmacological and neurochemical manipulations that might block or attenuate such behaviour. They have found that the 2 most effective events for reinstating responding after both short and long drug-free periods are re-exposure to the drug itself and exposure to a brief period of stress. The critical neurochemical pathways mediating drug-induced relapse are not identical to those mediating stress-induced relapse. Relapse induced by "priming" injections of heroin or cocaine involves activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways, whereas relapse induced by stress involves actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the brain, and of brain noradrenergic (NE) systems. In addition, evidence shows that CRF and NE may interact at the level of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in stress-induced relapse. By contrast, relapse induced by "priming" injections of drugs is relatively unaffected by manipulation of CRF and NE systems of the brain.

AB  - The present report investigated the contributions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the control of spontaneous alternation/working memory and anxiety-related behaviour. In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of microinjections of the selective kappa, receptor agonist, U-69,593, in the infralimbic cortex (IL) of CD-1 mice on several ethologically-derived anxiety indices in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and defensive/withdrawal (D/W) anxiety in the open field, as well as on memory in the EPM transfer-latency (T-L) test and implicit spontaneous alternation memory (SAP) in the Y-maze. In week 1, pretreatment with one injection of vehicle, 1, 10 or 25 nmol/1.0 mu l U-69,593 in the IL dose-dependently prolonged T-L and produced a dose-dependent anxiolytic behavioural profile in the first EPM trial. Following a 24-h delay, the same mice were given a drug-free second trial in the EPM tests of T-L memory and anxiety. Whereas T-L memory was not disturbed, small but detectable carry-over effects were observed in trial-2 EPM behaviour relative to vehicle-treated animals. In week 2, the same groups of mice were again pretreated with one injection of the same doses of U-69,593 in the IL and given a D/W test in an open field, followed immediately by an 8-min SAP trial in the Y-maze. The smallest U-69,593 dose was anxiolytic in the D/W test, and SAP/working memory was dose-dependently enhanced in the Y-maze. In Experiment 2, we evaluated whether 0.5 mu l volume microinjections would produce comparable behavioural and carry-over effects in the IL of three new groups of CD-1 mice, in the event that the 1.0 mu l volume injections used in Experiment 1 diffused beyond the IL and therefore may have confounded some effects. Experiment 2 procedures were carried out in the same manner as in Experiment 1, except the animals were tested in reverse order. Thus in week 1, SAP memory was tested in the Y-maze followed by D/W anxiety in the open field for half of the animals in each group, and the other half was tested in reverse order. In week 2, T/L memory and anxiety were tested in the EPM in 2 trials as described in Experiment I. Pretreatment with one injection of vehicle, 10 or 25 nmol/0.5 mu l U-69,593 in the IL reduced D/W anxiety and enhanced SAP memory regardless of testing order in week 1. In week 2, the same groups of mice were again pretreated with one injection of the same doses of U-69,593 in 0.5 mu l volumes in the IL and tested in the EPM. In a similar fashion to Experiment I, U-69,593 dose-dependently prolonged T/L and produced an anxiolytic behavioural profile in the first EPM trial. Following a 24-h delay, T/L recall memory was again not significantly influenced, but a robust anxiolytic behavioural profile was observed in the second drug-free anxiety vial in the EPM relative to vehicle-treated animals. Results are discussed relative to a) injection volumes and testing order, b) the possible influence kappa receptors may exert on neurochemical responsivity to anxiety-provoking environments in the IL area of the mPFC, c) the possibility that kappa-mediated anxiolysis from the IL in CD-1 mice results from interactions with neurochemical systems involved in the blunting of incoming anxiety-provoking information, d) evidence that SAP memory may be an implicit subtype of working memory, and e) the possibility that VL implicit working memory processes may modulate the induction and expression of anxiety-related behaviour.

Correlation analysis was used to examine associations between sites with poor benthic condition and measures of pollution exposure in the water column and sediment. Low dissolved oxygen events H-ere spatially extensive and strongly correlated with benthic community condition, explaining 42%; of the variation in the B-IBI. Sediment contamination was spatially Limited to a few specific locations including Baltimore Harbor and the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River and explained about 10% of the variation in the B-IBI. After removing the effects of low dissolved oxygen events, the residual variation in benthic community condition was weakly correlated with surrogates for eutrophication-water column concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. Associations between benthic condition and anthropogenic inputs and activities in the watershed were also studied by correlation analysis. Benthic condition was negatively correlated with measures of urbanization (i.e., population density, point source loadings, and total nitrogen loadings) and positively correlated with watershed forestation. Significant correlations were observed with population density and nitrogen loading below the fall Line, but not above it, suggesting that near-held activities have a greater effect on benthic condition than activities in the upper watershed. At the tributary level, the frequency of low dissolved oxygen events and levels of sediment contaminants were positively correlated with population density and percent of urban land use. Sediment contaminants were also positively correlated with point source nutrient Loadings. Water column total nitrogen concentrations were positively correlated dth nonpoint nutrient loadings and agricultural land use while total phosphorus concentrations were not correlated with land use or nutrient loading. Chlorophyll a concentrations were positively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the water column and with agricultural land use but were not correlated with nutrient loads.

AB  - The field of psychiatry is experiencing great excitement at this time, much as it was 100 years ago. Current excitement is rooted in the greatly strengthened therapeutics, new models for understanding, and an exponential increase in knowledge of brain function as well as in the opportunity to revise health care delivery. While public expectations of professionals have generally fallen, the role of the healer, which is at the heart of psychiatric practice, has remained high in public regard. Psychiatry has also had to develop new relationships with an active consumer movement. Consumers now appropriately expect be part of the planning, governance, and evaluation of care. Patients are questioning the research agenda and demand a role in determining the conduct of investigations. This active consumer movement is playing an important role in destigmatizing mental illnesses. Newer, nonmoralistic theories about mental illness and the profession's emphasis on the public trust have also played an important role. The increasing closeness of psychiatry to the rest of medicine has had a greatly beneficial impact, not only on stigma but also on diagnosis and treatment. Care must be taken, however, to see that diagnosis does not become a means to avoiding understanding of people. A welcome recent change has been the reunion between psychiatry and the addictions. This reunion has been facilitated by the development of multifactorial models of care in the mental health field and harm-reduction strategies in the addictions. This bodes well for more integrated treatment in the coming years. The strong psychiatric treatments that are now available and those on the horizon also auger well for an exciting period in our field. The excitement is enhanced by recognizing the multiple approaches to care that have been demonstrated to be effective and the need for great investment in research in this country and by developing new partnerships between the profession and public.

AB  - Some six or so physiological systems, essential to normal mammalian life, are involved in poisoning; an intoxication that causes severe injury to any one of them could be life threatening. Reversible chemical reactions showing Scatchard-type binding are exemplified by CO, CN- and cyclodiene neurotoxin insecticide intoxications, and by antigen-antibody complex: formation. Haemoglobin (Hb:) molecular biology accounts for the allosteric co-operativity and other characteristics of CO poisoning, CN- acts as a powerful cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, and antigen binding in a deep antibody cleft between two domains equipped with epitopes for antigen-binding groups explains hapten-specific immune reactions. Covalent chemical reactions with second-order (S(N)2) kinetics characterize Hg and Cd poisonings, the reactions of organophosphates and phosphonates with acetylcholinesterase and neurotoxic esterase and the reaction sequence whereby Paraquat accepts electrons and generates superoxide under aerobic conditions. Indirect carcinogens require cytochrome P450 activation to form DNA adducts in target-organ DNA and cause cancer, but a battery of detoxifying enzymes clustered with the P450 system must be overcome. Thus, S-metabolism competes ineffectively with target DNA for reactive vinyl chloride (VC) metabolites, epoxide hydrolase is important to the metabolism and carcinogenicity of aflatoxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo[a]pyrene, etc.), and the non-toxic 2-naphthylhydroxylamine N-glucuronide acts as a transport form in 2-naphthylamine bladder cancer. VC liver-cancer pathogenesis is explicable in terms of the presence of the glutathione S-transferase detoxifying system in hepatocytes and its absence from the fibroblastic elements, and of the VC concentrations reaching the liver by different administrative routes. In VC carcinogenicity, chemical reactions give imidazo-cyclization products with nucleoside residues of target DNA, and in benzene leukaemia, Z,Z-muconaldehyde forms cyclic products containing a pyrrole residue linked to purine. Increased HbCO concentrations reduce the O-2-carrying capacity of the blood, and the changed shape of the O-2-Hb dissociation curve parallels disturbance in O-2 unloading. CN- acts on electron transport and paralyses respiration. In telodrin poisoning, preconvulsive glutamine formation abstracts tricarboxylic acid intermediates incommensurately with normal cerebral respiration. Antigen-antibody complexing depletes the antibody titre, available against infection. At high doses of Cd, Cd-thionein filtered through the kidneys is reabsorbed and tubular lesions produced. Some organophosphate insecticides promote irreversible acetylcholinesterase phosphorylation and blockade nerve function, and others react with neurotoxic esterase to cause delayed neuropathy. The evidence far Paraquat pulmonary poisoning suggests a radical mechanism involving three interrelated cyclic reaction stages. The action of N- and O-6 (O substituent in 6-position of the purine) demethylases explains deletion mechanisms for DNA-alkyl adducts. DNA-directed synthesis in the presence of ultimate carcinogens provides for an estimation of misincorporations, which implicate the same transversions as those found by direct mutagenicity testing.
   Chemical carcinogens recognize tissue-sensitive cells and modify their heritable genetic complement. Oncoproteins encoded by activated oncogenes signal the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. The importance of the H-ras oncogene and p53 tumour-suppressor gene is stressed.
   Antidotal action is analysed; for example, parenteral glutamine administration to telodrin-intoxicated rats restores the depleted cerebral glutamate level and prevents seizures. Glutamate acts as anticonvulsant in petit mal epilepsy. In general, therefore, the reaction of the toxicant-related substance with the relevant target-tissue macromolecule accounts for the biochemical/biological events at a cellular level and also the symptoms in the living mammal. This mechanism is analogous to mechanisms for diseases such as arthritis and Parkinsonism.

AB  - Objective: Although schizophrenia is generally regarded as an illness with onset in late adolescence or early adult life, a sizeable minority of patients first become ill in middle or old age. Inconsistencies in diagnostic systems and nomenclature, coupled with a tendency among most schizophrenia researchers to ascribe late-onset psychoses to organic factors, have led to such cases occupying an ambiguous position in relation to schizophrenia. Through systematic review of the literature and publication of a consensus statement from an international group of experts in the field, this article aims to clarify the positions of late-onset schizophrenia and very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. Method: The authors conducted a MEDLINE literature review and developed a consensus statement summarizing the findings from 2 days of debate and discussion by members of the International Late-Onset Schizophrenia Group. Results: The group achieved consensus on diagnosis, nomenclature, treatment guidelines, and future research directions. Conclusions: In terms of epidemiology, symptom profile, and identified pathophysiologies, the diagnoses of late-onset schizophrenia (illness onset after 40 years of age) and very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (onset after 60 years) have face validity and clinical utility. General adoption of these categories will foster systematic investigation of such patients.

AB  - A review is presented of the investigations carried out concerning the adaptive behavior of persons with the dual disability of mental retardation and autism/PDD. A close correspondence is found between the results obtained by means of a Dutch set of scales, the SRZ, SGZ, and SMZ, and those obtained by means of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Compared with matched nonautistic persons, the performance of dually disabled persons is found to be particularly poor in the domain Social Skills/Socialization and somewhat less poor in the domain Communication. Performance of the two categories does not differ in the domains Self Help/Daily Living Skills and Gross Motor Skills/Motor Skills. As a net result, persons of the dually disabled category are found to obtain comparatively low total scores for social competency, the SRZ-Total/Adaptive Behavior Composite. In addition, autistic mentally retarded persons are found to display more maladaptive behavior. For comparative studies in the mental retardation field the use of level of Self Help/Daily Living Skills and, to a lesser extent, level of Gross Motor Skills/Motor Skills are recommended as suitable matching variables.

   Method. Mental health economic studies were ascertained through a systematic Medline search, chasing references at the end of papers acquired from the initial medline search and details of studies furnished by members of the WHO collaborating centre.
   Results: Only a small number of mental health economic studies from developing countries were identified. They were mainly cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness studies.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric disorders impose a significant burden in developing countries. It is not always possible to extrapolate findings from developed countries to developing countries. Potential avenues for future research and development are discussed.

AB  - A wide range of studies have been published over the past two decades that involve the intersection of sleep EEG, insomnia, psychiatric illness (especially depressive disorders) and psychopharmacology. Much of value has been discovered, but there have also been false starts and contradictory results. There is in fact strong evidence that insomnia is associated with medical and psychiatric illness and that the sleepiness associated with insomnia is the cause of many accidents. Thus, the direct (visits to doctors, cost of sleeping medication, complications from use of these medications) and indirect (accidents, quality of life) costs of insomnia are enormous and constitute a major public health problem in the industrialized countries. Believing that it is now timely to assess the state of this important research area, a consensus conference was convened on June 26-28, 1998, in Porto Cervo (Italy) to attempt to clarify the important issues and findings on the clinical effect of the different classes of antidepressant drugs on sleep quality in depression. The participants' consensus on some of the main topics is presented with the hope that this discussion and analysis will contribute to productive research in this important field.

AB  - Traditional effluent and ambient water column toxicity tests have been used widely for evaluating the contamination of stormwaters and sediments. These assays consist of a routine bioassay exposure design of 1 to 9 days using freshwater and marine/estuarine species known to be sensitive to a wide range of toxicants. While effluent toxicity may be indicative of sediment or stormwater toxicity in the receiving system, the exposure is different, and therefore toxicity cannot be readily predicted. Traditional, standardized, whole effluent toxicity (WET) test methods have been used effectively and also misused in evaluations of whole sediments, pore (interstitial) water, elutriates (extracts), and stormwaters. Results show these methods to be very sensitive to sediment and stormwater toxicity. These traditional toxicity tests are predictive of instream sediment or stormwater effects where significant contamination exists or where exposure concentrations are similar. Modifications of these standardized test methods to include sediments or pore waters have been shown to be as sensitive as short-term, whole sediment toxicity tests using benthic species. However, the added complexity of sediments and stormwaters (e.g., partitioning, high Kow compound bioavailability, suspended solids, sporadic exposures, multiple exposure pathways) dictates that traditional toxicity test applications be integrated into a more comprehensive assessment of ecologically significant stressors. The limitations of the WET testing approach and optimized sample collection and exposure alternatives are frequently ignored when implemented. Exposure to sporadic pulses of contaminants (such as in stormwaters) often produce greater toxicity than exposure to constant concentrations. Lethality from short-term pulse exposures may not occur for weeks after the high flow event due to uptake dynamics. Pore water and elutriate exposures remove sediment ingestion routes of exposure and alter natural sorption/desorption dynamics. Traditional toxicity tests may not produce reliable conclusions when used to detect the adverse effects of: fluctuating stressor exposures, nutrients, suspended solids, temperature, UV light, flow, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, endocrine disruption, or other important subcellular responses. This reality and the fact that ecologically significant levels of high K-ow compounds may not produce short-term responses in exposures dictates that additional and novel assessment tools be utilized in order to protect aquatic ecosystems. This inablilty to predict effects is largely a result of the complex biological response patterns that result from various combinations of stressor magnitudes, duration, and frequency between exposures and also the interactions of stressor mixtures, such as syngergistic effects of certain pesticides, metals, and temperature. In watersheds receiving multiple sources of stressors, accurate assessments should define spatial-temporal profiles of exposure and effects using a range of laboratory (such as WET tests) and novel in sine toxicity and bioaccumulation assays, with simultaneous characterizations of physicochemical conditions and indigenous communities.

AB  - Objective: This article reviews evidence indicating that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have psychotropic properties, Method: The author reviewed the English-language literature pertinent to the response of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions to cholinergic agents. Results: The cholinergic system originates in the basal forebrain and projects diffusely to the cerebral cortex; the limbic and paralimbic regions receive the most abundant cholinergic projections, The basal forebrain nuclei are positioned at the interface of the limbic system and cerebral cortex, where they play a role in mediating emotional responses. The basal forebrain nuclei are atrophic in Alzheimer's disease, leading to a widespread cholinergic deficit. The cholinergic disturbance may contribute to neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease. The treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors reduces neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly apathy and visual hallucinations. In some studies, a variety of other neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported to respond to treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Response profiles vary among acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Conclusions: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have psychotropic effects and may play an important role in controlling neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These agents also may contribute to the management of other disorders with cholinergic system abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptoms, The beneficial response is most likely mediated through limbic cholinergic structures.

AB  - Hypofunction of prefrontal cortical regions, such as dorsolateral and orbital regions, has been suggested to contribute to the symptomatology of schizophrenia. In the rat, the medial and the lateral prefrontal cortices are considered as homologs of the primate dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices, respectively. The present study investigated in rats the effects of lesions of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices on latent inhibition, prepulse inhibition and amphetamine-induced activity. These paradigms are known to be modulated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, a system that has been suggested to be involved in the symptomatology of schizophrenia. Latent inhibition and prepulse inhibition are disrupted in schizophrenic patients as well as in rats treated with amphetamine. Amphetamine-induced activity was tested under dim light (low stress) and bright light (high stress) because stressful situations selectively increase mesocortical dopamine activity. Lateral prefrontal cortex lesioned animals did not differ in their behavior from control animals in any of the paradigms used in this study. Medial prefrontal cortex lesions did not affect latent inhibition but increased prepulse inhibition. In the amphetamine-induced activity experiment, prior to drug administration, open field locomotion was reduced under bright illumination for all lesion groups. After amphetamine administration, medial prefrontal cortex lesions attenuated the hyperlocomotor effect of the drug under the dim light condition and potentiated it under the bright light condition. The results indicate that medial and lateral prefrontal cortex can be functionally differentiated by their involvement in the modulation of behavior requiring mesocorticolimbic dopamine activation.
   The results in amphetamine induced activity suggest that the behavioral outcomes associated with medial prefrontal cortex depend on the background (stress) against which the evaluation is made. The results also support the notion that prepulse inhibition may be a better model than latent inhibition of the symptoms of schizophrenia associated with dysfunctional prefrontal activity.

AB  - The field of neuroscience has, after a long period of looking the other way, again embraced emotion as an important research area. Much of the progress has come from studies of fear, and especially fear conditioning. This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as "affect," "hedonic tone," or "emotional feelings," and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this foundation into broader aspects of mind and behavior.

AB  - The expression of aggressiveness, which constitutes many facets of behavior, is influenced by a complex interaction of biologic, psychologic, and social variables. Even though individual differences in impulsivity and the behavioral consequences, such as aggression, addiction, and suicidality, are substantially heritable, they ultimately result from an interplay between genetic variations and environmental factors. While formation and integration of multiple neural networks is dependent on the actions of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (5HT), converging lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression influences complex traits including that of inappropriately aggressive behavior. This contribution reviews studies of major gene effects in inbred and knockout strains of mice with increased aggression-related behavior and discusses the relevance of several serotonergic gene variations in humans which include high aggressiveness as part of the phenotype. Although special emphasis is given to the molecular psychobiology of 5HT in aggression-related behavior in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, relevant conceptual and methodological issues in the search for candidate genes for impulsivity and aggressiveness and for the development of mouse models of aggressive and antisocial behavior in humans are also considered.

   Method: An initial search of MEDLINE abstracts (1966-1999) was conducted using the terms sex or gender and schizophrenia, followed by systematic search of all relevant articles.
   Results: Males have consistently an earlier onset, poorer premorbid functioning and different premorbid behavioral predictors. Males show more negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, with greater structural brain and neurophysiological abnormalities. Females display more affective symptoms, auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions with more rapid and greater responsivity to antipsychotics in the premenopausal period but increased side effects. Course of illness is more favorable in females in the short- and middle-term, with less smoking and substance abuse. Families of males are more critical, and expressed emotion has a greater negative impact on males. There are no clear sex differences in family history, obstetric complications, minor physical anomalies and neurological soft signs.
   Conclusion: This review supports the presence of significant differences between schizophrenic males and females arising from the interplay of sex hormones, neurodevelopmental and psychosocial sex differences.

AB  - This review proposes that implicit learning processes are the cognitive substrate of social intuition. This hypothesis is supported by (a) the conceptual correspondence between implicit learning and social intuition (nonverbal communication) and (b) a review of relevant neuropsychological (Huntington's and Parkinson's disease), neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical data. It is concluded that the caudate and putamen, in the basal ganglia, are central components of both intuition and implicit learning, supporting the proposed relationship. Parallel, but distinct, processes of judgment and action are demonstrated at each of the social, cognitive, and neural levels of analysis. Additionally, explicit attempts to learn a sequence can interfere with implicit leaming. The possible relevance of the computations of the basal ganglia to emotional appraisal, automatic evaluation, script processing, and decision making are discussed.

AB  - Experimental design is the method of choice for establishing whether social interventions have the intended effects on the populations they are presumed to benefit. Experience with field experiments, however, has revealed significant limitations relating chiefly to (a) practical problems implementing random assignment, (b) important uncontrolled sources of variability occuring after assignment, and (c) a low yield of information for explaining why certain effects were or were not found. In response, it is increasingly common for outcome evaluation to draw on some form of program theory and extend data collection to include descriptive information about program implementation, client characteristics, and patterns of change. These supplements often cannot be readily incorporated into standard experimental design, especially statistical analysis. An important advance in outcome evaluation is the recent development of statistical models that are able to represent individual-level change, correlates of change, and program effects in an integrated and informative manner.

AB  - In attempting to make sense of other people, perceivers regularly construct and use categorical representations to simplify and streamline the person perception process. Noting the importance of categorical thinking in everyday life, our emphasis in this chapter is on the cognitive dynamics of categorical social perception. In reviewing current research on this topic, three specific issues are addressed: (a) When are social categories activated by perceivers, (b) what are the typical consequences of category activation, and (c) can perceivers control the influence and expression of categorical thinking? Throughout the chapter, we consider how integrative models of cognitive functioning may inform our understanding of categorical social perception.

AB  - Many diseases are influenced by weather conditions or display strong seasonality, suggestive of a possible climatic contribution. Projections of future climate change have, therefore, compelled health scientists to re-examine weather/disease relationships There are three projected physical consequences of climate change: temperature rise, sea level rise, and extremes in the hydrologic cycle. This century, the Earth has warmed by about 0.5 degrees centigrade, and the mid-range estimates of future temperature change and sea level rise are 2.0 degrees centigrade and 49 centimeters, respectively, by the year 2100. Extreme weather variability associated with climate change may especially add an important new stress to developing nations that are already vulnerable as a result of environmental degradation, resource depletion, overpopulation, or location (e.g. low-lying coastal deltas). The regional impacts of climate change will vary widely depending on existing population vulnerability. Health outcomes of climate change can be grouped into those of: (a) direct physical consequences, e.g, heat mortality or drowning; (b) physical/chemical sequelae, e.g. atmospheric transport and formation of air pollutants; (c) physical/biological consequences, e.g. response of vector- and waterborne diseases, and food production; and (d) sociodemographic impacts, e.g. climate or environmentally induced migration or population dislocation. Better understanding of the linkages between climate variability as a determinant of disease will be important, among other key factors, in constructing predictive models to guide public health prevention.

AB  - Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are responsible for a substantial fraction of morbidity and mortality and are responsible for more years of life lost than most of human diseases. In this review, we have tried to delineate behavioral factors that collectively represent the principal cause of three out of five RTCs and contribute to the causation of most of the remaining. Although sharp distinctions are not always possible, a classification of behavioral factors is both necessary and feasible. Thus, behavioral factors can be distinguished as (i) those that reduce capability on a long-term basis (inexperience, aging, disease and disability, alcoholism, drug abuse), (ii) those that reduce capability on a short-term basis (drowsiness, fatigue, acute alcohol intoxication, short term drug effects, binge eating, acute psychological stress, temporary distraction), (iii) those that promote risk taking behavior with long-term impact (overestimation of capabilities, macho attitude, habitual speeding, habitual disregard of traffic regulations, indecent driving behavior, non-use of seat belt or helmet, inappropriate sitting while driving, accident proneness) and (iv) those that promote risk taking behavior with short-term impact (moderate ethanol intake, psychotropic drugs, motor vehicle crime, suicidal behavior, compulsive acts). The classification aims to assist in the conceptualization of the problem that may also contribute to behavior modification-based efforts.

AB  - The objective of this review was to synthesize existing information regarding the effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on marsh macrophytes in a manner that will help guide research and improve spill-response efficiency. Petroleum hydrocarbons affect plants chemically and physically. Although plants sometime survive fouling by producing new leaves, even relatively non-toxic oils can stress or kill plants if oil physically prevents plant gas-exchange. Plant sensitivity to fouling varies among species and among populations within a species, age of the plant, and season of spill. Physical disturbance and compaction of vegetation and soil associated with clean-up activities following an oil spill appear to have detrimental effects on the US Gulf coast marshes. Other techniques, including the use of chemicals such as cleaners or bioremediation, may be necessary to address the problem. Clean-up may also be beneficial when timely removal prevents oil from migrating to more sensitive habitats. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Until recently, most neuroscientists did not regard consciousness as a suitable topic for scientific investigation. This reluctance was based on certain philosophical mistakes, primarily the mistake of supposing that the subjectivity of consciousness made it beyond the reach of an objective science. Once we see that consciousness is a biological phenomenon like any other, then it can be investigated neurobiologically. Consciousness is entirely caused by neurobiological processes and is realized in brain structures. The essential trait of consciousness that we need to explain is unified qualitative subjectivity. Consciousness thus differs from other biological phenomena in that it has a subjective or first-person ontology, but this subjective ontology does not prevent us from having an epistemically objective science of consciousness. We need to overcome the philosophical tradition that treats the mental and the physical as two distinct metaphysical realms. Two common approaches to consciousness are those that adopt the building block model, according to which any conscious field is made of its various parts, and the unified field model, according to which we should try to explain the unified character of subjective states of consciousness. These two approaches are discussed and reasons are given for preferring the unified field theory to the building block model. Some relevant research on consciousness involves the subjects of blindsight, the split-brain experiments, binocular rivalry, and gestalt switching.

AB  - There has been an explosion of new information on the neurobiology of dendritic spines in synaptic signaling, integration, and plasticity. Novel imaging and analytical techniques have provided important new insights into dendritic spine structure and function. Results are accumulating across many disciplines, and a step toward consolidating some of this work has resulted in Dendritic Spines of the Hippocampus. Leaders in the field provide a discussion at the level of advanced undergraduates, with sufficient detail to be a contemporary resource for research scientists. Critical reviews are presented on topics ranging from spine structure, formation, and maintenance, to molecular composition, plasticity, and the role of spines in learning and memory. Dendritic Spines of the Hippocampus provides a timely discussion of our current understanding of form and function at these excitatory synapses. We asked authors to include areas of controversy in their papers so as to distinguish results that are generally agreed upon from those where multiple interpretations are possible. We thank the contributors for their insights and thoughtful discussions. In this paper we provide background on the structure, composition, function, development, plasticity, and pathology of hippocampal dendritic spines. In addition, we highlight where each of these subjects will be elaborated upon in subsequent papers of this special issue of Hippocampus. Hippocampus 2000;30:501-571. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To outline the limitations of traditional studies of outcome in schizophrenia and to review the findings arising from 'first episode' psychosis studies.
   Method: An extensive literature search was performed and relevant papers were examined and analysed.
   Results: Current knowledge regarding outcome predictors in schizophrenia has primarily been derived from a series of 'consecutive admission' and 'long-term follow-back' studies. However, methodological considerations may limit the generalisability of these studies' findings. The prospective evaluation of first episode cohorts has advanced our knowledge regarding the relative importance of premorbid and intercurrent factors in determining outcome in schizophrenia,
   Conclusions: To date, the 'first episode' strategy has highlighted some potentially clinically modifiable outcome predictors. These findings may open the way for targeted introduction of measures aimed at preventing poor outcomes in schizophrenia.

AB  - Pain is an important focus for consciousness research because it is an avenue for exploring somatic awareness, emotion, and the genesis of subjectivity. In principle, pain is awareness of tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain. The purpose of this paper is to help bridge pain research and consciousness studies. It reviews the basic sensory neurophysiology associated with tissue injury, including transduction, transmission, modulation, and central representation. In addition. it highlights the central mechanisms for the emotional aspects of pain, demonstrating the physiological link between tissue trauma and mechanisms of emotional arousal. Finally, we discuss several current issues in the field of pain research that bear on central issues in consciousness studies, such as sickness and sense of self. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - The aim of this review was to try to establish the current neurophysiological knowledge capable of explaining the differences of mental functioning during the different stages of sleep and waking. The analysis focused on the cortical state. Waking is characterized by electrophysiological activities (low voltage and gamma range EEG field patterns. unitary activities) and cerebral blood flow reflecting an activated state.
   On the contrary, neurochemical influences are marked by inhibitory afferent processes since dopamine. noradrenaline, serotonine and histamine tend, for the most part, to inhibit cortical neurons by diffuse release at the level of varicosities. During slow wave sleep, all these brain stem influences sustaining the cortical state decrease and transiently disappear just pi inr to onset of REM sleep.
   During REM sleep, pontine and mesopontine ascending activating influences invade the cortex in their turn while neurochemical inhibitory influences disappear with the exception of dopaminergic ones.
   We hypothesize that the activating influences acting on the cortex allow the latter to function, just as petrol makes an engine run, but that the diffuse inhibitory influences somehow regulate cortex functioning. Therefore, it is understandable that, during waking, mental activity is reflective and rational, and that psychological content is less intense during slow wave sleep.
   During REM sleep, the activated and mostly disinhibited state might induce the characteristic dream activity which appear to be rather ill-considered and illogical. Persistent dopaminergic input combined with the absence of noradrenergic input may induce psychological activities somewhat similar to those related to psychotic syndromes.
   Deactivation of part of the prefrontal cortex could contribute to this unusual mental activity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent advances in the field include the use of techniques for mapping brain activity and probing cortical excitability, as well as observation of brain lesioned patients during imaging tasks; these advances provide new insights into the covert aspects of motor activity.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper is to develop an aetiological model for borderline personality disorder.
   Method: The postulates of Hughlings Jackson are used to provide a preliminary explanatory framework for borderline phenomena. As a necessary background to this discussion, the findings concerning abuse in the early history of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other conditions, notably somatisation disorder and dissociative states, are briefly reviewed. Other data, including family studies, which might have significance in the aetiology of BPD are also reviewed.
   Results: The hypothesis is put forward that the symptoms of BPD are due to the failure of 'experience-dependent' maturation of a cascade of neural networks, with prefrontal connections, which become active relatively late in development and which coordinate disparate elements of central nervous system function. These networks subserve higher psychological functions, including attentional focus and affect regulation. They also underpin the reflective function necessary to the emergence of self as the stream of consciousness, which appears at about the age of 4 years.
   Conclusion: Adverse developmental circumstances may produce an interrelated set of symptom clusters, with associated neural network disturbances that are amenable to investigation with psychometric and brain imaging techniques. Since these disturbances are seen as 'experience-dependent', they are considered reversible, at least in part.

AB  - The unique biogeochemistry of wetlands either causes or influences many landscape functions that are valued by society. Because of their critical ecological role and the importance of wetlands to commodity and noncommodity values, we have reviewed the current state of knowledge regarding influences of silviculture on nutrient circulation, transformation, and retention in forested wetlands. Our approach was to contrast riverine and depressional systems. Globally, there are few generalizations that can be made regarding the effects of silvicultural disturbance. This conclusion is primarily a result of too few studies on the mechanisms and processes controlling ecosystem responses. Most work to date has focused solely on characterizing responses of state variables, and therefore a basis for integration is often lacking. While studies do show that water quality functions are not degraded as a result of harvesting, many other aspects of ecosystem functionality are not clarified. As examples, there are significant gaps in our understanding of biogeochemical controls on net primary productivity, organic matter turnover, and hydrologic interactions. Considerable research is warranted to provide information for effective resource management and conservation.

AB  - Recently, the study of sensory cortex has focused on the context-dependent evolution of receptive fields and cortical maps over millisecond to second timescales,This article reviews advances in our understanding of these processes in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI), Subthreshold input to individual rat SI neurons is extensive, spanning several vibrissae from the center of the receptive field, and arrives within 25 ms of vibrissa deflection, These large subthreshold receptive fields provide a broad substrate for rapid excitatory and inhibitory multi-vibrissa interactions,The 'whisking' behavior, an similar to 8 Hz ellipsoid movement of the vibrissae, introduces a context-dependent change in the pattern of vibrissa movement during tactile exploration. Stimulation of vibrissae over this frequency range modulates the pattern of activity in thalamic and cortical neurons, and, at the level of the cortical map, focuses the extent of the vibrissa representation relative to lower frequency stimulation (I Hz). These findings suggest that one function of whisking is to reset cortical organization to improve tactile discrimination. Recent discoveries in primary visual cortex (VI) demonstrate parallel non-linearities in center-surround interactions in rat SI and VI, and provide a model for the rapid integration of multi-vibrissa input,The studies discussed in this article suggest that, despite its original conception as a uniquely segregated cortex, rat SI has a wide array of dynamic interactions, and that the study of this region will provide insight into the general mechanisms of cortical dynamics engaged by sensory systems.

AB  - The field of psychiatry has an opportunity to construct a more refined, perhaps more enduring understanding of the ethical basis of mental illness research, The aim of this paper is to help advance this understanding by 1) tracing the evolution of the emerging ethic for biomedical experimentation, including recent recommendations of the President's National Bioethics Advisory Commission, and 2) reviewing data and concepts related to compelling ethical questions now faced in the study of mental disorders. Empirical findings on informed consent, the ethical safeguards of institutional review and surrogate decision making, and the relationship between scientific and ethical imperatives are outlined. Psychiatric researchers will increasingly be called ripen to justify their scientific approaches and to seek ways of safeguarding the wellbeing of people with mental illness who participate in experiments. Most importantly, psychiatric investigators will need to demonstrate their appreciation and respect for ethical dimensions of investigation with special populations. Further empirical study and greater sophistication with respect to the distinct ethical issues in psychiatric research are needed. Although such measures present many challenges, they should not interfere with progress in neuropsychiatric science so long as researchers in our field seek to guide the process of reflection and implementation.

AB  - Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals, (C) 1999 John Wiley Bt Sons, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To review the published literature of the past 15 years regarding use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in psychiatric practice. These drugs, especially verapamil, have been recommended as possible treatments for mania and other disorders.
   Methods: The Cumulative Medical Index and other databases were searched and back-tracked to locate relevant articles. Sixty-one such articles were uncovered 37 anecdotal reports, 7 partially controlled reports, and 17 controlled trials.
   Results: Most studies involved treatment of mania using verapamil. Although anecdotal reports were generally favourable, results from partially controlled reports or controlled clinical trials were mixed. Generally, verapamil was less effective than was lithium or placebo. Treatment of depression with CCBs was not very successful, regardless of the type of trial; the best trial was negative. The same was true for the treatment of schizophrenia, although the cases studied were extremely chronic and treatment-resistant Evidence for efficacy in other illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease or tardive dyskinesia was scanty but suggested that further trials might be in order.
   Conclusions: CCBs do not at present have an established place in psychiatric treatment. Nonetheless clinicians faced with a manic patient not responsive to other antimanic drugs, either alone or in combination, might consider adding verapamil as an adjunct. A study bearing on this specific issue is needed to determine whether or not such off-label use would really be justified.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on compliance in psychoses and to evaluate the significance of the different compliance components presented.
   Method: Different definitions of the term compliance were first gathered. A search covering the years 1974-1997 was conducted in Medline and PsycLit databases using the keywords 'schizophrenia' or 'psychosis' and 'compliance'. The studies that took compliance into account as a separate variable were collected for further analysis.
   Results: Unpleasant side-effects of medication, attitudes towards medication, delusional symptoms, substance abuse, insight, and supportive family environment were found to have the strongest correlation with compliance. The influence of cognitive impairment is not clearly proven. Integrated, cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducational treatment models include several methods to improve therapeutic alliance and compliance.
   Conclusion: As the majority of the studies have concentrated on neuroleptic treatment? the medication-related factors are best documented. In clinical practice, treatment compliance is based on patient-related, medication-related and interactional factors, such as treatment model and therapeutic alliance. Difficulties with insight and cognitive functioning are specific patient-related factors in the treatment of psychoses.

AB  - The efficacy of psychotropic drugs varies depending on the time of administration. This phenomenon is observed with antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and psychostimulants. The presence or absence of this phenomenon and the rhythm phase in the efficacy of each drug varies depending on the drug, dose, parameter measured, animal species, and strain. A recent study demonstrating circannual changes in the phases of circadian rhythm of drug efficacy suggests that discrepancies between studies may be considerably explained by the presence of a circannual rhythm. The rhythms in drug effects are suggested not to be due to rhythmic changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drugs but rather to an endogenous rhythm in drug susceptibility resulting from a circadian rhythm in the intracerebral neurotransmission system. The presence of this phenomenon and its law have been demonstrated to a considerable extent in animals, but corresponding clinical reports in humans remain insufficient despite its clinical importance. Further study in humans is certainly warranted.

The method used was a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (found by computer and hand searches) comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo or no treatment, in depressed adults with a specified,physical disorder. The main outcome measures are numbers of individuals who recover/improve at the end of the trial and, as a proxy for treatment acceptability, numbers who complete treatment. 18 studies were included, covering 838 pa patients with a range of physical diseases. 6 studies used SSRIs, 3 atypical antidepressants, and the remainder tricyclics. Patients treated with antidepressants were significantly more likely to improve than those given placebo: about 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4). Most antidepressants (tricyclics and SSRIs together, 15 trials) produced a small but significant increase in dropout (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.40. NNH 9.8, 95% CI 5.4-42.9). The "atypical" antidepressant mianserin produced significantly less dropout than placebo. Trends towards tricyclics being more effective than SSRIs, but also more likely to produce dropout were noted. The review provides evidence that antidepressants, significantly more frequently than either placebo or no treatment, cause improvement in depression in patients with a wide range of physical diseases.

TI  - Some notes on the 'heroic self' and the meaning and importance of its reparation for the creative process and the creative personality
AB  - The author discusses a few points in a long clinical history from which he has derived the notion of 'heroic self, describing how it manifested through 'heroic' projective and introjective identifications He also demonstrates the importance of repairing both the heroic self and the internal objects, and how essential it is for the analyst to differentiate between the heroic self and its megalomaniac psychopathic manifestations, and to recover the heroic self when it appears to be lost, as in the case of severe, quasi-melancholic, depression. By heroic self and heroic projective and introjective identifications, he means the creative person's specific need to associate himself with, to compete with and excel the heroes of his own cultural tradition. The creative person is able to no so via these projections and introjections, and the need is based on the creator's inner awareness of naturally possessing unusual, or even outstanding gifts, in other words, the creative person has an awareness of being, or of the possibility of becoming, a creative hero. Brief reference is made throughout to other clinical material, and in the final section further support is given to the author's views on the heroic self with short quotations and examples from non-psychoanalytic sources that provide further interesting evidence of the existence and functioning of the heroic self With particular reference to Segal's work in this field (1952, 1991), and her notion of 'meaningful form', the author tries to further develop its implications in the light of the heroic self and of the heroic projective and introjective identifications, as far as the creator and those who respond to and evaluate his or her work are concerned.

AB  - The syndrome of contralesional neglect reflects a lateralized disruption of spatial attention. In the human, the left hemisphere shifts attention predominantly in the contralateral hemispace and in a contraversive direction whereas the right hemisphere distributes attention more evenly, in both hemispaces and both directions. As a consequence of this asymmetry severe contralesional neglect occurs almost exclusively after right hemisphere lesions. Patients with left neglect experience a loss of salience in the mental representation and conscious perception of the left side and display a reluctance to direct orientating and exploratory behaviours to the left. Neglect is distributed according to egocentric, allocentric, world-centred, and object-centred frames of reference. Neglected events can continue to exert an implicit influence on behaviour, indicating that the attentional filtering occurs at the level of an internalized representation rather than at the level of peripheral sensory input. The unilateral neglect syndrome is caused by a dysfunction of a large-scale neurocognitive network, the cortical epicentres of which are located in posterior parietal cortex, the frontal eye fields, and the cingulate gyrus. This network coordinates all aspects of spatial attention, regardless of the modality of input or output. It helps to compile a mental representation of extrapersonal events in terms of their motivational salience, and to generate 'kinetic strategies' so that the attentional focus can shift from one target to another.

TI  - Reflections on the Shape of the River
KW  - ETHNICITY
AB  - The debate over race-conscious admissions to selective colleges and universities has taken a new turn. The emotionally fraught moral argument continues, but facts-long largely hidden from public view-are now in the mix.
   The much-celebrated work by William G. Bowen and Derek Bok, The Shape of the River, adds to our store of data and is thus a welcome addition to the literature. But in this Book Review, Stephan and: Abigail Thernstrom conclude that the evidence upon which this brief for racial preferences relies does not withstand close scrutiny.
   Bowen and Bok contend that the weight given to race in the admissions process at highly selective colleges and universities is slight, and that preferentially admitted students do well both in school and beyond. Their own numbers, however, paint quite a different picture, the Thernstroms find. Preferences are truly preferential, and black students admitted under racial double standards do not fare well academically. Other data on law and medical schools tell much the same story: Heavy racial preferences are coupled with high failure rates relative to those of whites and Asians.
   Race-conscious admissions to elite schools have, according to Bowen and Bok, created the backbone of the black and Hispanic middle class, but their book contains data on neither Hispanics nor Asians, a serious omission. More importantly, the Thernstroms argue that admissions officers at elite institutions do not in general determine the socioeconomic fabric of African-American life. Throughout, Bowen and Bok's argument is marred by ahistorical reasoning, lapses in logic, methodological flaws, missing information, and missed opportunities to gather or further interpret important data.
   Bowen and Bok are militant advocates of "diversity," and yet they provide no definition of the term and thus no standard against which diversity policies can be assessed. Moreover, they fail to engage the serious moral arguments of those who oppose all race-conscious Policies. The Thernstroms conclude that critics of preferential policies are right to believe that sorting Americans into arbitrary racial categories perpetuates terrible habits of mind deeply at odds with the nation's unrealized egalitarian dream.

AB  - Objective: The therapeutic effect of phototherapy for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been widely investigated. However, the antidepressant effect of various light intensities is inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship of phototherapy for SAD.
   Method: A meta-analytical methodology was applied to 39 studies of phototherapy for SAD. The studies collected were screened for study quality by a threats-to-validity method before inclusion. The fixed-effects-model analysis of variance procedures were used for data analysis.
   Results: The results indicated that different light intensities produced different effects in reducing the typical symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, of patients with SAD. However, no significant differences in these effects were revealed between strong, medium and dim light in reducing the atypical symptoms of patients.
   Conclusion: These findings showed that light intensity varied positively with the antidepressant effect for typical but not for atypical symptoms of SAD, suggesting that light intensity tended to have different therapeutic effects on the typical and atypical symptoms of SAD.

   Method: Schizophrenia is selected as an example from mental health and cardiovascular disease as an example from physical health. For each of these disorders, empirical findings on prenatal influences are reviewed, and the methods used to demonstrate them are critiqued.
   Results: Research on prenatal antecedents of these conditions has proceeded in parallel: intriguing findings have related fetal growth restriction or fetal insult to adult health; similar types of causal pathways have been proposed to explain the relationships; and research has been plagued by similar limitations, including lack of precise prenatal exposure data and difficulty of controlling confounding. The prevailing view of disease causation, which is not well-suited to investigation of prenatal antecedents, impedes research in both fields. Yet, there has been little interchange between researchers in the 2 fields,
   Conclusions: We propose a causal paradigm that could serve as a guide for future investigations on the prenatal antecedents of adult health and promote interchange between research on mental and physical health. The paradigm reflects current thinking in epidemiology by encompassing not only risk factors as traditionally conceived but also causal chains over time and causal influences at multiple levels of organization. Implications for the design of new research are illustrated with reference to an ongoing study.

AB  - In the treatment of psychiatric patients with complicating medical illness, clinicians may encounter patients who cannot take oral medications. The review will acquaint the practicing clinical psychiatrist with psychotropic medications available by nonenteral routes of administration. A computerized MEDLINE search was conducted of the literature 1981 to 1997 All articles citing nonenteral routes of psychotropic medication administration,were reviewed. The results are summarized according to drug class and specific routes of administration (intervenous, intramuscular, sublingual, rectal). Psychotropic medications now available comes from small case series or case reports. Intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration of psychotropics are the most common. In addition, certain psychotropics are available by less common routes, such as sublingual or rectal administration. Consideration of alterations in pharmacokinetics, including poorer absorption and slower metabolism, are discussed. Clinicians may need to consider these novel routes of medication administration when dealing with patients unable to take oral medications.

TI  - Enforcing fair labor standards in the modern American sweatshop: Rediscovering the statutory definition of employment
KW  - GARMENT INDUSTRY
KW  - WORKERS
AB  - Employers' treatment of workers as nonemployees to avoid compliance with mandatory labor standards has become a worldwide epidemic. In this Article, Bruce Goldstein, Marc Linder, Laurence Norton, II, and Catherine Ruckelshaus offer a statutory interpretation that would put an end to this sham under two important laws: the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA).
   This Article Proposes a reexamination of the approach to determining coverage when a company's contractor hires, supervises, and pays workers. Often larger companies use such contracting to lower their labor costs and to evade labor standards laws. In industries like agriculture and garment manufacturing, contractors frequently violate minimum-wage and overtime laws, but cannot be held accountable because they are undercapitalized and difficult to find.
   Courts deciding whether to hold larger companies liable under the FLSA and AWPA as "employers" of workers hired by their contractors almost invariably ignore the statutory definition of "employ. Instead, they have applied a test based on factors rooted in the common law's restrictive definition of employment. The authors argue that the judiciary's disregard of the words "employ includes to suffer or permit to work, has led to fifty years of inadequately reasoned decisions and inconsistent enforcement of basic labor standards. This Article examines and argues for a return to the statutory "employ" language.
   The Article reveals that the "suffer or permit to work" definition has a long and illuminating history. Initially wed to impose criminal liability for allowing third parties to engage in unlawful conduct like the illicit sale of liquor, by the 1880s it was used by workplace reformers to strengthen laws prohibiting child labor. When Congress included the phrase in the FLSA of 1938, the "suffer or permit to work" language was ubiquitous in child labor and other labor-protective laws and well developed in state case law.
   To employ at common law predominantly meant to engage to work when the engaging party had the right to control the manner in which the work was performed. To permit to work was broader. It did not require the affirmative act of engaging a person to work, but only a decision to allow the work to take place. The Article demonstrates chat to suffer to work was broader still. To suffer in this context meant to tolerate or to acquiesce in. It required only chat the business owner have the reasonable ability to know that the work was being performed and the power to prevent it. Thus, work performed as a necessary step in the production of a product was almost always suffered or permitted by the business owner.
   Reformers who promoted the "suffer or permit" standard sought to ameliorate abuses of the "sweating system. The "sweater" was the labor intermediary who "sweated" a profit out of his workers by depressing their wages as far as possible below che amount paid him by the manufacturer. Factory owners benefited and workers suffered from ruthless competition among these labor contractors, The reformers sought to impose responsibility on the parties with the economic power to improve working conditions, i.e., the manufacturers hiring contractors. One of the reformers' tools was the "suffer or permit" standard.
   But the FLSA's expansive definition of "employ" was not merely the culmination of reform efforts to improve working conditions. As the authors show, it was also an outgrowth of earlier New Deal regulation that depended on industry-wide coverage to protect law-abiding, fair-wage employers from the cutthroat competition of industry chiselers, who used subcontracting and other schemes to cut labor costs. The FLSA's broad definition of "employ" was intended to deny a competitive advantage to employers who maintained substandard labor conditions through such devices as abusive subcontractors.
   Many of the restrictive common-law factors courts now use in determining coverage under the FLSA and the AWPA, such as who hired, supervised, and paid the workers, are pertinent only to determining common-law employment. While all employers at common law are also employers under the more expansive FLSA and AWPA, the common-law "control" factors are not necessary in determining the scope of "suffer or permit to work.
   The origins and application of the "suffer or permit" language show that business owners suffer or permit the work and are therefore employers of persons who perform services in their business operations. When such services are a part of the owner's production process, it makes no difference that the workers were hired, paid, and supervised by another, even if the other entity ordinarily is considered an independent contractor.
   The authors conclude that the business owner may avoid accountability for unpaid minimum wages and substandard working conditions suffered by such workers only when his contractor has such a high level of expertise and capital investment that the business operates autonomously from the business owner. Only when the business owner lacks and could not, given the scale and scope of his business, integrate the expertise and specialized capital of his contractor can he avoid liability under the "suffer or permit to work" standard.

AB  - A variety of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that dopamine is a toxic molecule that may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and ischemia-induced striatal damage. While much attention has focused on the fact that the metabolism of dopamine produces reactive oxygen species (peroxide, superoxide, and hydroxyl radical), growing evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter itself may play a direct role in the neurodegenerative. process. Oxidation of the dopamine molecule produces a reactive quinone moiety that is capable of covalently modifying and damaging cellular macromolecules, This quinone formation occurs spontaneously, can be accelerated by metal ions (manganese or iron), and also arises from selected enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Macromolecular damage, combined with increased oxidant stress, may trigger cellular responses that eventually lead to cell death. Reactive quinones have long been known to represent environmental toxicants and, within the context of dopamine metabolism, may also play a role in pathological processes associated with neurodegeneration. The present discussion will review the oxidative metabolism of dopamine and describe experimental evidence suggesting that dopamine quinone may contribute to the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of this essential neurotransmitter.

AB  - The processes whereby our brains continue to learn about a changing world in a stable fashion throughout life are proposed to lead to conscious experiences. These processes include the learning of top-down expectations, the matching of these expectations against bottom-up data, the focusing of attention upon the expected clusters of information, and the development of resonant states between bottom-up and top-down processes as they reach an attentive consensus between what is expected and what is there in the outside world. It is suggested that all conscious states in the brain are resonant states and that these resonant states trigger learning of sensory and cognitive representations. The models which summarize these concepts are therefore called Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, models. Psychophysical and neurobiological data in support of ART are presented from early vision, visual object recognition, auditory streaming, variable-rate speech perception, somatosensory perception, and cognitive-emotional interactions, among others. It is noted that ART mechanisms seem to be operative at all levels of the visual system, and it is proposed how these mechanisms are realized by known laminar circuits of visual cortex. It is predicted that the same circuit realization of ART mechanisms will be found in the laminar circuits of all sensory and cognitive neocortex. Concepts and data are summarized concerning how some visual percepts may be visibly, or modally, perceived, whereas amodal percepts may be consciously recognized even though they are perceptually invisible. It is also suggested that sensory and cognitive processing in the What processing stream of the brain obey top-down matching and learning laws that are often complementary to those used for spatial and motor processing in the brain's Where processing stream. This enables our sensory and cognitive representations to maintain their stability as we learn more about the world, while allowing spatial and motor representations to forget learned maps and gains that are no longer appropriate as our bodies develop and grow from infanthood to adulthood. Procedural memories are proposed to be unconscious because the inhibitory matching process that supports these spatial and motor processes cannot lead to resonance. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - The construction of Neveu-Schwarz superconformal held theories for any N is given via a superfield formalism. We also review some results and definitions of superconformal manifolds and generalise contour integration and Taylor expansion to superconformal spaces. For arbitrary N we define (uncharged) primary fields and give their infinitesimal change under superconformal transformations. This leads us to the operator product expansion of the stress-energy tensor with itself and with primary fields. In this way we derive the well-known commutation relations of the Neveu-Schwarz superconformal algebras K-N. In this context we observe that the central extension term disappears for N greater than or equal to 4 for the Neveu-Schwarz theories. Finally, we give the global transformation rules of primary fields under the action of the algebra generators.

AB  - The goal of this review is to give a detailed description of the main results obtained in the field of learning-induced plasticity. The review is focused on receptive Field and map changes observed in the auditory, somatosensory and visual thalamo-cortical systems as a result of an associative training performed in waking animals.
   Receptive field (RF) plasticity, 2DG and map changes obtained in the auditory and somatosensory system are reviewed. In the visual system, as there is no RF and map analysis during learning per se, the evidence presented are From increased neuronal responsiveness, and from the effects of perceptual learning in human and non human primates.
   Across sensory modalities, the re-tuning of neurons to a significant stimulus or map reorganizations in favour of the significant stimuli were observed at the thalamic and/or cortical level.
   The analysis of the literature in each sensory modality indicates that relationships between learning-induced sensory plasticity and behaviourial performance can, or cannot. be found depending on the tasks that were used.
   The involvement (i) of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in the described neuronal changes and (ii) of neuromodulators as "gating" factors of the neuronal changes, is evaluated. The weakness of the Hebbian schema to explain learning-induced changes and the need to better define what the word "learning" means are stressed.
   It is suggested that future research should focus on the dynamic of information processing in sensory systems, and the concept of "effective connectivity" should be useful in that matter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper reviews the empirical evidence which has emerged regarding the proposed relationships among stress, coping skills and various forms of disordered eating. Method: A search of psychological and medical databases was conducted to identify studies examining life events, and other types of psychological stress and coping strategies, in relation to the onset of disordered eating. Results: Despite methodological limitations such as the use of non-representative samples and retrospective methodologies, evidence of relationships between stress, coping and disordered eating was obtained in the majority of studies reviewed. Discussion: The implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research, including the utilization of longitudinal, prospective studies, are presented.

AB  - Comparative cognition is an emerging interdisciplinary field with contributions from comparative psychology, cognitive/experimental and developmental psychology, animal learning, and ethology, and is poised to move toward greater understanding of animal and human information-processing, reasoning, memory, and the phylogenetic emergence of mind. This chapter highlights some current issues and discusses four areas within comparative cognition that are yielding new approaches and hypotheses for studying basic conceptual capacities in nonhuman species. These include studies of imitation, tool use, mirror self-recognition, and the potential for attribution of mental states by nonhuman animals. Though a very old question in psychology, the study of imitation continues to provide new avenues for examining the complex relationships among and between the levels of imitative behaviors exhibited by many species. Similarly, recent work in animal tool use, mirror self-recognition (with all its contentious issues), and recent attempts to empirically study the potential for attributional capacities in nonhumans, all continue to provide fresh insights and novel paradigms for addressing the defining characteristics of these complex phenomena.

AB  - There is mounting evidence for mitochondrial involvement in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, whether inherited or acquired, lead to impaired electron transport chain (ETC) functioning. Impaired electron transport, in turn, leads to decreased ATP production, formation of damaging free-radicals, and altered calcium handling. These toxic consequences of ETC dysfunction lead to further mitochondrial damage including oxidation of mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids, and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an event linked to cell death in numerous model systems. Although protective nuclear responses such as antioxidant enzymes and bcl-2 may be induced to combat these pathological changes, such a vicious cycle of increasing oxidative damage may insidiously damage neurons over a period of years, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. This hypothesis, a synthesis of the mitochondrial mutations and oxidative stress hypotheses of neurodegeneration, is readily tested experimentally, and clearly points out many potential therapeutic targets for preventing or ameliorating these diseases.

It was then administered to several thousand people in each country. Analyses of these data are presented indicating that the scale has good psychometric properties. In addition, a laboratory study and several field studies are described that demonstrated the INCOM's ability to predict comparison behavior effectively. Possible uses of the scale in basic and applied settings are discussed.

AB  - Noradrenergic and/or serotonergic deficits, as well as other abnormalities, may contribute to predisposition to some epilepsies and depressions. Evidence for this hypothesis stems from several sources. Epidemiological investigations are intriguing but incomplete. Pharmacological studies show that noradrenergic and/or serotonergic transmission are both anticonvulsant and antidepressant. Therapeutically pertinent investigations show that antidepressant drugs have anticonvulsant properties, whereas antiepileptic drugs are effective in the management of affective disorders. Additional investigations demonstrate that seizures, whether spontaneously occurring or therapeutically induced, protect against depression. Through studies of innate pathophysiology, noradrenergic and serotonergic deficits have been identified in individuals with depression and in animal models of epilepsy, as well as in some humans with epilepsy. Vagal nerve stimulation, a treatment already known to be effective in the epilepsies, is presently under investigation for effectiveness in affective disorder. New evidence suggests that vagal nerve stimulation exerts at least some of its therapeutic effects through its capacity to increase noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission. Finally, emerging evidence supports the concept that some genetic mammalian models of the human epilepsies exhibit analogous manifestations of depression.

AB  - This paper contains a literature review of the occupational injuries and ill-hearth in agriculture world-wide and a survey of the attempts that have been made to estimate the resulting economic and social costs.
   Agricultural workers suffer a wide variety of disorders as a result of their occupation. These range from minor (cuts, bruises) to more severe (deep wounds, fractures), permanent (amputation, spinal cord injury) and fatal injury. III-health as a result of contact with animals, micro-organisms, plant material dusts or chemicals are associated with certain types of agriculture. There is an underlying but unquantified incidence of pain, stress and injury as a result of ergonomic problems due to poor working procedures and conditions. Statistics from many countries or regions show that agriculture consistently has one of the highest accident and injury rates of the industrial sectors.
   There are many causes for the work related injury and ill-health in agricultural workers. In developed countries, tractors and other machinery cause a significant proportion of the accidents and are a major cause of occupational deaths. In less developed countries, accidents due to hand tools such as hoes, sickles and cutting instruments are most prevalent. Animals are a significant cause of injury and ill-health in many countries. Debilitating allergic reactions in the respiratory tract or the skin are caused by exposures to organic dusts, or by contact with allergenic plants in the field respectively. Where comparative data are available, occupational pesticide poisoning in agriculture is a small proportion (< 1-4%) of the total work related disorders.
   Because of the wide variety of occupational risks to agricultural workers, it is emphasised that if one type of agricultural practice is replaced by another then the risks from the alternative procedure need to be considered. If, for example, agrochemical pest control practices are replaced by methods involving the increased use of machinery, draught animals or manual operations, then an assessment of the resulting risks should be taken into account.
   Some of the economic costs of occupational injury and ill-health in agriculture can be quantified directly, such as medical costs, the cost of rehabilitation and loss of earnings. Other costs are more difficult to estimate such as loss of opportunity and income foregone for permanent and fatal injury and for the effect on a victim's family. The estimation of the overall economic costs to farming communities and national agriculture requires further development. When one agricultural practice is replaced wholly or partly by another, for example agrochemical pest control by alternative control methods, then it is necessary to take into account the occupational health costs of the alternative procedure for realistic comparative assessment.
   There are a number of issues which require continued or increased attention by the relevant national and international authorities and by the agricultural industry. These include the improved collection and collation of occupational health statistics, a better understanding of the extent of ergonomic problems in agriculture, more realistic assessments of the cost of occupational injury and ill-health and the continued need to reduce occupational health disorders by appropriate training and education in agricultural practices and the use of agricultural equipment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1 million persons in the United States. It is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia or slowness, gait disturbance, and postural instability. Pathological features include degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta coupled with intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration and Lewy bodies can also be found in the locus ceruleus, nucleus basalis, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cranial nerve motor nuclei, and central and peripheral components of the autonomic nervous system. Current treatment consists of a dopamine replacement strategy using primarily the dopamine precursor levodopa. While levodopa provides benefit to virtually all PD patients, after 5-10 years of treatment the majority of patients develop adverse events in the form of dyskinesia (involuntary movements) and fluctuations in motor response. Further, disease progression is associated with the development of dementia, autonomic dysfunction, and postural instability, which do not respond to levodopa therapy. Accordingly, research efforts have been directed reward understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of PD in the hope of developing a more effective therapy that will slow or halt the natural progression of PD. This paper reviews recent advances.

AB  - Neurological findings suggest that the human striate cortex (V1) is an indispensable component of a neural substratum subserving static achromatic form perception in its own right and not simply as a central distributor of retinally derived information to extrastriate visual areas. This view is further supported by physiological evidence in primates that the finest-grained conjoined representation of spatial detail and retinotopic localization that underlies phenomenal visual experience for local brightness discriminations is selectively represented at cortical levels by the activity of certain neurons in V1. However, at first glance, support for these ideas would appear to be undermined by incontrovertible neurological evidence (visual hemineglect and the simultanagnosias) and recent psychophysical results on 'crowding' that confirm that activation of neurons in Vt may, at times, he insufficient to generate a percept. Moreover, a recent proposal suggests that neural correlates of visual awareness must project directly to those in executive space, thus automatically excluding V1 from a related perceptual space because V1 lacks such direct projections. Both sets of concerns are, however, resolved within the context of adaptive resonance theories. Recursive loops, linking the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) through successive cortical Visual areas to the temporal robe by means of a series of ascending and descending pathways, provide a neuronal substratum at each level within a modular framework for mutually consistent descriptions of sensory data. At steady state, such networks obviate the necessity that neural correlates of visual experience project directly to those in executive space because a neural phenomenal perceptual space subserving form vision is continuously updated by information from an object recognition space equivalent to that destined to reach executive space. Within this framework, activity in V1 may engender percepts that accompany figure-ground segregations only when dynamic incongruities are resolved both within and between ascending and descending streams. Synchronous neuronal activity on a short timescale within and across cortical areas, proposed and sometimes observed as perceptual correlates, may also serve as a marker that a steady state has been achieved, which, in turn, may be a requirement for the longer time constants that accompany the emergence and stability of perceptual states compared to the faster dynamics of adapting networks and the still faster dynamics of individual action potentials. Finally, the same consensus of neuronal activity across ascending and descending pathways linking multiple cortical areas that in anatomic sequence subserve phenomenal Visual experiences and object recognition may underlie the normal unity of conscious experience.

AB  - Psychology can and should be at the forefront of participation in social, community, and preventive interventions. This chapter focuses on selective topics under two general areas: violence as a public health problem and health promotion/competence promotion across the life span. Under violence prevention, discussion of violence against women, youth violence, and child maltreatment are the focal points. Under health and competence promotion, attention is paid to the prevention of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS. We highlight a few significant theoretical and empirical contributions, especially from the field of community/prevention psychology. The chapter includes a brief overview of diversity issues, which are integral to a comprehensive discussion of these prevention efforts. We argue that the field should extend its role in social action while emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous research as a component of future interventions.

AB  - Cloning of MAO (monoamine oxidase) A and B has demonstrated unequivocally that these enzymes are made up of different polypeptides, and our understanding of MAO structure, regulation, and function has been significantly advanced by studies using their cDNA. MAO A and B genes are located on the X-chromosome (Xp 11.23) and comprise 15 exons with identical intron-exon organization, which suggests that they are derived from the same ancestral gene. MAO A and B knockout mice exhibit distinct differences in neurotransmitter metabolism and behavior. MAO A knock-out mice have elevated brain levels of serotonin, norephinephrine, and dopamine and manifest aggressive behavior similar to human males with a deletion of MAO A. In contrast, MAO B knock-out mice do nor exhibit aggression and only levels of phenylethylamine are increased. Mite lacking MAO B are resistant to the Parkinsongenic neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Both MAO A and B knock-out mice show increased reactivity to stress. These knock-out mice are valuable models for investigating the role of monoamines in psychoses and neurodegenerative and stress-related disorders.

AB  - Lesions of the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex may display similar cognitive deficits. Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have clarified the functional role of prefrontal cortical areas in certain cognitive operations involved in simple language tasks. We have addressed the role of the caudate nucleus in tasks of lexical decision, semantic categorization, recognition memory, reading aloud and object naming by recording neuronal activity in patients with depth electrodes. During visual processing of words, caudate cells exhibited excitatory responses related to both semantic and phonological-articulatory encoding with non-overlapping time courses. The firing rate of the cells was increased when the semantic processing was required. This occurred within 400-600 ms after the stimulus onset, or within the first 200-300 ms of the delay period. The increased firing within 1000-1200 ms after the stimulus onset was related to the phonological processing. These responses turned out to be strikingly similar to those in Broca's area. Both reading aloud and explicit memory retrieval tasks elicited a sustained inhibition of firing of the same cells with a greater onset latency. Chronometric comparison of prefrontal, temporo-parietal and caudate activities in similar tasks relates the time course of these activations to the fronto-caudate anatomical loops and helps further understanding of the anatomy and circuitry involved in human cognition.

AB  - Covalent binding of ubiquitin to proteins marks them for degradation by the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway. This pathway plays a major role in the breakdown of abnormal proteins that result from oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and mutations. Failure to eliminate ubiquitinated proteins disrupts cellular homeostasis, causing degeneration. Inclusions containing ubiquitinated proteins are commonly detected in many neurological disorders. These aggregates are mostly cytosolic; nevertheless, ubiquitinated inclusions are found in endosomes/lysosomes in Alzheimer's disease and prion encephalopathies, and in nuclei in disorders associated with CAG/polyglutamine repeats, such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. Ubiquitinated aggregates must result: from a malfunction or overload of the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway or from structural changes in the protein substrates, halting their degradation. Prevention of protein aggregation in these diseases might offer new therapeutic leads.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a critical review of the literature on the matter of mental illness and violence, to examine whether there is enough evidence to establish a casual link, and to provide epidemiological background to measure the risk to the population.
   Method: Based on a computerized search of the literature on mental illness and violence previously conducted for Health Canada, studies in the area were critically reviewed and divided into 3 main categories: 1) studies of criminal and violent behaviour among psychiatric patients, 2) studies of psychiatric illness among offenders (prevalence studies in institutions, analytical studies, and community follow-up of offenders), and 3) epidemiological community-based studies on the issue of mental illness and violence (police-citizen encounters, representative samples, and other epidemiological studies). Causality rules and measures of risk were then applied to the evidence elicited.
   Results: The review of the literature suggests that only a small minority of hospitalized patients, typically those suffering from acute psychotic symptoms, are involved in violent incidents. Formerly hospitalized patients are at a higher risk of committing violence if they are not properly treated and are experiencing threat/control-override psychotic symptoms. Substance abuse disorders significantly raise the risk of violence. Family members are the most at risk of being victimized.
   Conclusion: An association exists between mental illness and violence, but the many covariations that naturally affect the equation between them introduce uncertainties in establishing causality.

AB  - In our current health care context, characterized by fiscal restraint and decentralization of accountability for health to regional authorities, geographic inequities in need, access to care, utilization, and health outcomes will come under increasing scrutiny. Knowledge gained from ecological studies about geographic disparities in mental health are likely to have important implications for policy, program planning, and resource allocations. In light of the growing relevance of the geography of mental health, this paper will review (1) selected contributions of geographic studies to the field of mental health, (2) common ecologic study approaches used in most geographic studies, (3) key conceptual and methodological challenges related to the application and interpretation of ecologic models in mental health, and (4) the wider potential of this technique for resource equity. Given the importance of geography for needs assessment and service planning, it is surprising that geographic study designs, which use ecological data, have not received greater attention as an important and viable method of assessing population mental health.

Cognitive- behavioural therapy seems to be an effective treatment for depressive symptoms and mild depressive disorders, it may also be a useful preventive intervention thought this remains to be conclusively demonstrated. There have been no systematic studies comparing psychological treatments with medication.

AB  - Although hypothermia as a means of cerebral protection against and resuscitation from ischemic damage has a history of approximately six decades, extensive studies, both in basic and clinical fields, on the mechanisms, effects and methods of mild hypothermia at temperatures no less than 31 degrees C have started only in the last decade. In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments. Large scale randomized studies involving multiple institutions as well as exchange of informations and ideas are needed for further development of hypothermia treatment.

AB  - In the past 15 years the release of neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the locus coeruleus (LC) has been studied by using three approaches: microdialysis; push-pull superfusion; and voltammetry. These sophisticated techniques, which render it possible to follow the time course and magnitude of neurochemical changes in anaesthetized and conscious animals, have permitted great strides towards understanding neurotransmission in the LC. It appears that noradrenaline, known to be released in distant terminal fields, is also released in the somatodendritic area of LC neurons in response to drugs and physiological stimuli. Furthermore, determination of in vivo release enables the identification of functionally important neurotransmitter systems involved in relaying and integrating information reaching the LC via afferent neurons. As outlined in this review, the release rates of glutamate, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid. glycine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and catecholamines, are modified in particular by arousing and stressful stimuli. pain, changes in cardiovascular homeostasis, as well as during opioid withdrawal or the sleep-wake-cycle. Profound interactions also occur between some of the neurotransmitters released during these situations. It appears that individual stimuli produce distinct neurochemical changes which contribute to the regulation of neuronal LC activity. Stimuli that activate LC neurons, such as pain, fall of blood pressure, noise, opiate withdrawal, do not produce a uniform response but modality-specific release patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters within the LC. From these studies and from existing neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data our knowledge of how neurotransmitters work in concert to regulate the functional state of LC noradrenergic perikarya in physiological and pathophysiological conditions is just emerging.

Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness emerged most frequently in associations with vocational behavior.

AB  - Objective: To review the drug treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to provide guidelines for the physician on how to integrate these treatments into the overall management of this disorder.
   Method: A qualitative review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of medications used to treat cognitive deficits, disease progression, agitation, psychosis, or depression in AD. A computerized search of Medline was used to identify, relevant literature published during the period 1968-1998. Key words used in the search were 'randomized controlled trials, with 'dementia' and with 'Alzheimer's disease'.
   Results: Agents that are currently available in Canada to treat the cognitive deficits of AD include donepezil, ginkgo biloba, selegiline, and ergoloid mesylates. Donepezil and ginkgo biloba are associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement in cognitive function in a substantial minority of patients with mild to moderate AD. Selegiline may have a mild beneficial effect on cognitive function in some patients with AD, but the data are inconclusive. Ergoloid mesylates have questionable efficacy in AD and can only be recommended as a last line of treatment. The results of a single trial suggest that vitamin E or selegiline (both have antioxidant properties) may slow the progression of AD. Antipsychotic medications can result in clinically significant improvement in agitation and psychosis. Carbamazepine also appears to be an effective treatment for agitation in AD, and there is preliminary evidence that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram reduces irritability in this disorder. There is no evidence that other nonneuroleptic medications are more efficacious than placebo in treating agitation in AD. Limited data indicate that depression in dementia responds to antidepressant medication.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that selected medications can be used to treat cognitive deficits, disease progression, agitation, psychosis, and depression in AD. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in patients' responses to these medications. Pharmacotherapy needs to be considered as a component of a package of care that also includes psychosocial and environmental interventions and support of the caregiver.

AB  - Background Antidepressant therapy is not always effective and is slow to take effect. In theory, these shortfalls may be caused by induction of neuronal negative feedback via pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Pindolol, an antagonist at somatodentritic pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors has been investigated as a potential accelerator and augmentor of antidepressant response.
   Method A Medline search was conducted in November 1997.
   Results Six open-label studies and six controlled studies were identified for review.
   Conclusions Open-label studies strongly suggest that pindolol may accelerate and augment antidepressant response. but controlled studies do not wholly support these findings: only three of six studies clearly demonstrate benefit. Larger, well-designed. controlled trials are needed to determine definitively the effectiveness of pindolol in this context.

AB  - Psychophysical studies indicate that observers recognise the laterality of single, randomly oriented, visually presented hands by implicitly moving their left hand into the orientation of any left hand stimulus and their right hand into the orientation of right hand stimuli. Such data imply that lateralised somatic sensorimotor representations are engaged as one's action is mentally simulated to perceive stimulus handedness. This hypothesis was evaluated in a positron emission tomography study in which (mostly) right hands were tachistoscopically presented to the left visual field (right cerebral hemisphere) and vice versa. Exploiting known cerebral lateralisations, the design allowed the observation of a spatial dissociation of visual-field-lateralised and limb-lateralised neural activity. Although the primary somatosensory and motor cortices were not activated, strong regional cerebral blood flow increases (task minus rest) were observed in frontal (motor) and parietal (somatosensory) areas similar to those activated by actual and imagined movement. Limb-contralateral activations were in pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), cerebellum, and opercular and superior frontal sulcal premotor cortex; these areas are implicated in a variety of motor and somatosensory functions. Activations in the dominant left hemisphere regardless of the limb were localised in SMA proper, superior premotor cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, areas involved in planning, guidance, and attention to motor performance. Activations in the nondominant right hemisphere for both limbs were present in dorsal superior premotor cortex, insula, superior parietal cortex, and occipitotemporal cortex; these areas underlie motor planning, high-level somatic representation, evaluation of visuospatial information, and representation of object/action identity. Overall, these data confirm or extend prior understanding of the distributed system of brain areas supporting motor imagery and the left-right judgement of body parts.

AB  - Background Despite the widespread adoption of hospital at home services it is not known if these services represent an effective way to manage patients, compared with in-patient hospital care.
   Method A systematic review was carried out of randomized controlled trials comparing hospital at home care with acute hospital in-patient care for patients age 18 years and over, excluding those with long-term care needs, obstetric patients, and those requiring mental health services. The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, Social Science Citation Index, CINAHL, EconLit, PsychLit, SIGLE, Medical Care supplement on economic literature, and the EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group) register. Data were extracted for the following outcomes: mortality, clinical complications, re-admissions, costs, hospital days saved from the provision of hospital at home, discharge destination from hospital at home, functional status, psychological well-being, patient satisfaction and carer satisfaction. Data analysis and quality assessment were undertaken independently by two reviewers using a data checklist, following standard methods described by the EPOC group.
   Results Five trials were included in the review. No statistically significant differences were detected for patient health outcomes. Patients discharged early from hospital to hospital at home following elective surgery expressed greater satisfaction with care than those who remained in hospital. Carers, however, expressed less satisfaction with hospital at home compared with hospital care. Only one trial, which recruited patients requiring terminal care, formally tested for a difference in cost. No statistically significant difference was detected for overall net health costs.
   Conclusions This review does not support the widespread adoption of hospital at home, nor the discontinuation of existing schemes for elderly medical patients, patients who have had elective surgery, or those with a terminal illness. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of hospital at home on patient outcomes, or cost to the health service.

AB  - Objective: To examine empirical data on children with autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) for continuities or distinguishing features between disorders and to see to what extent the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria reflect observed data.
   Method: Studies were identified in 4 ways. 1) A Medline search from 1976 to the present of articles with the key words autism, pervasive developmental disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and Asperger, of these articles, those with mesh headings or textwords "cluster," which identified cluster analyses deriving pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) subtypes, were retained. 2) The Journal of Autistic and Developmental Disorders from 1990 to the present was hand-searched to identify other empirically derived studies on diagnosis, prevalence, classification and validity of PDD subtypes. 3) Key review articles were searched for their references. 4) The references of all identified articles were searched.
   Results: Eight cluster studies were retained for their relevance to diagnostic issues, as were 7 empirically derived studies delineating clinical characteristics of children with AD, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD-NOS. Data suggest that children with PDD may fit into 1 of 2 overlapping groups, including a lower-functioning group with greater developmental compromise, social aloofness, and a greater number of autistic symptoms and a higher-functioning group with higher IQ, fewer autistic symptoms, and more prosocial behaviour. The PDD subtypes resemble each other and can be seen as existing on a continuum, differing only by degree of impairment.
   Conclusion: Children exhibiting the triad of autistic impairments can be seen as suffering from disorders on a PDD continuum. While the DSM-IV does identify a lower-functioning autistic group (AD), the higher-functioning group is less well sewed. Asperger's disorder as defined in the DSM-IV is not clearly distinguishable from AD and PDD-NOS, and the PDD-NOS subcategory is not operationalized. Further research is required to elaborate criteria for the higher-functioning PDD group, and measures related to etiology, outcome, and treatment response may help determine which diagnostic criteria can meaningfully separate one disorder from another.

AB  - A neuropsychological theory is proposed that assumes category learning is a competition between separate verbal and implicit (i.e., procedural-learning-based) categorization systems. The theory assumes that the caudate nucleus is an important component of the implicit system and that the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices are critical to the verbal system. In addition to making predictions for normal human adults, the theory makes specific predictions for children, elderly people, and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, major depression, amnesia, or lesions of the prefrontal cortex. Two separate formal descriptions of the theory are also provided. One describes trial-by-trial learning, and the other describes global dynamics. The theory is tested on published neuropsychological data and on category learning data with normal adults.

AB  - Freshwater inflow is one of the most influential landscape processes affecting community structure and function in lagoons, estuaries, and deltas of the world; nevertheless there are few reviews of coastal impacts associated with altered freshwater inputs. A conceptual model of the possible influences of freshwater inflows on biogeochemical and trophic interactions was used to structure this review, evaluate dominant effects, and discuss tools for coastal management. Studies in the Gulf of Mexico were used to exemplify problems commonly encountered by coastal zone managers and scientists around the world. Landscape alteration, impacting the timing and volume of freshwater inflow, was found to be the most common stress on estuarine systems. Poorly planned upstream landscape alterations can impact wetland and open-water salinity patterns, nutrients, sediment fertility, bottom topography, dissolved oxygen, and concentrations of xenobiotics. These, in turn, influence productivity, structure, and behavior of coastal plant and animal populations. Common biogeochemical impacts include excessive stratification, eutrophication, sediment deprivation, hypoxia, and contamination. Common biological impacts include reduction in livable habitats, promotion of "exotic" species, and decreased diversity.
   New multiobjective statistical models and dynamic landscape simulations, used to conduct policy-relevant experiments and integrate a wide variety of coastal data for freshwater inflow management, assume that optimum estuarine productivity and diversity is found somewhere between the stress associated with altered freshwater flow and the subsidy associated with natural flow. These models attempt to maximize the area of spatial overlap where favorable dynamic substrates, such as salinity, coincide with favorable fixed substrates, such as bottom topography. Based upon this principle of spatial overlap, a statistical performance model demonstrates how population vitality measurements (growth, survival, and reproduction) can be used to define sediment, freshwater, and nutrient loading limits. Similarly, a spatially articulate landscape simulation model demonstrates how cumulative impacts and ecosystem processes can be predicted as a function of changes in freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inflows.

AB  - Possible inputs to the DMH were studied first using the fluorescent retrograde tracer Fluorogold, and identified cell groups were then injected with the anterograde tracer PHAL to examine the distribution of labeled axons in and around the DMH. From this work, we conclude that the majority of inputs to the DMH arise in the hypothalamus, although there are a few significant projections from the telencephalon and brainstem. With few exceptions, each major nucleus and area of the hypothalamus provides inputs to the DMH. Telencephalic inputs arise mainly in the ventral subiculum, infralimbic area of the prefrontal cortex, lateral septal nucleus, and bed nuclei of the stria terminalis. The majority of brainstem inputs arise in the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and ventrolateral medulla. In addition, it now seems clear that inputs to the DMH use only a few discrete pathways. Descending inputs course through a periventricular pathway through the hypothalamic periventricular zone, a medial pathway that follows the medial corticohypothalamic tract, and a lateral pathway traveling through medial parts of the medial forebrain bundle. Ascending inputs arrive through a midbrain periventricular pathway that travels adjacent to the cerebral aqueduct in the periaqueductal gray, and through a brainstem lateral pathway that travels through central and ventral midbrain tegmental fields and enters the hypothalamus, and then the DMH from more lateral parts of the medial forebrain bundle. The results are discussed in relation to evidence for involvement of the DMH in ingestive behavior, and diurnal and stress-induced corticosterone secretion. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This article describes a neuropsychological theory of motor skill learning that is based on the idea that learning grows directly out of motor control processes. Three motor control processes may be tuned to specific tasks, thereby improving performance: selecting spatial targets for movement, sequencing these targets, and transforming them into muscle commands. These processes operate outside of awareness. A 4th, conscious process can improve performance in either of 2 ways: by selecting more effective goals of what should be changed in the environment or by selecting and sequencing spatial targets. The theory accounts for patterns of impairment of motor skill learning in patient populations and for learning-related changes in activity in functional imaging studies. It also makes a number of predictions about the purely cognitive, including accounts of mental practice, the representation of motor skill, and the interaction of conscious and unconscious processes in motor skill learning.

AB  - A consistent neurochemical abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD) is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia ni,ora, leading to a reduction of striatal dopamine (DA) levels. As tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyses the formation of L-DOPA, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of DA, the disease can be considered as a TH-deficiency syndrome of the striatum. Similarly, some patients with hereditary L-DOPA-responsive dystonia, a neurological disorder with clinical similarities to PD, have mutations in the TH gene and decreased TH activity and/or stability. Thus, a logical and efficient treatment strategy for PD is based on correcting or bypassing the enzyme deficiency by treatment with L-DOPA, DA agonists, inhibitors of DA metabolism, or brain grafts with cells expressing TH. A direct pathogenetic role of TH has also been suggested, as the enzyme is a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro and a target for radical-mediated oxidative injury. Recently, it has been demonstrated that L-DOPA is effectively oxidized by mammalian TH in vitro, possibly contributing to the cytotoxic effects of DOPA. This enzyme may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of PD at several different levels, in addition to being a promising candidate for developing new treatments of this disease.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to suggest a model for the development of mental representation. First, the fertility of empiricist and constructivist models of mental representation is explored. It is concluded that the constructivist model provides a better ground for building a theory of mental representation. Next, Piaget's constructivist account of the emergence of mental representation is presented and evaluated. Because Piaget's account proves insufficient in explaining the emergence of mental representation, the authors suggest a modification of Piaget's account. According to this proposal, higher-order operations are necessary for the development of mental representation. This proposal serves as the basis for reinterpreting several findings of Piaget's studies on representational development. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - Field dependence-independence was originally conceived as a neutral style dimension, in that field-dependent subjects were considered to be as well-adapted to their environment as field-independent subjects. Subsequent authors, however, questioned this assumption of neutrality, on the grounds that field-independent subjects generally perform better in certain intellectual tasks, Such findings provoked interest in the possible repercussions of field dependence-independence for education. Here, we review research into the possible effects of FDI on achievement at school. In general, field-independent subjects perform better than field-dependent subjects, whether assessment is of specific disciplines or across the board. We discuss possible explanations for this difference in performance.

AB  - Experiments involving single-unit recordings and microiontophoresis were carried out in the barrel cortex of awake, adult rats subjected to whisker pairing, an associative learning paradigm where deflections of the recorded neuron's principle vibrissa (S2) are repeatedly paired with those of a non-adjacent one (S1). Whisker pairing with a 300 ms interstimulus interval was applied to 61 cells. In 23 cases, there was no other manipulation whereas in the remaining 38, pairing occurred in the presence of one of three pharmacological agents previously shown to modulate learning, receptive field plasticity and long-term potentiation: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) (n = 8), the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (n = 17) or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-nitro-arginine-N-methyl-ester (L-NAME) (n = 13). Non-associative (unpaired) experiments (n = 14) and delivery of pharmacological agents without pairing (n = 14) served as controls. Changes in neuronal responsiveness to S1 following one of these procedures were calculated and adjusted relative to changes in the responses to S2. On average, whisker pairing alone yielded a 7% increase in the responses to S1. This enhancement differed significantly from the 17% decrease obtained in the non-associative control condition and could not be attributed to variations in the state of the animals because analysis of the cervical and facial muscle electromyograms revealed that periods of increased muscular activity, reflecting heightened arousal, were infrequent (less than 4% of a complete experiment on average) and occurred randomly. The enhancement of the responses to S1 was further increased when whisker pairing was performed in the presence of L-NAME (27%) or NMDA (35%) whereas AP5 reduced it to 1%. During the delivery period, NMDA enhanced both neuronal excitability and responsiveness to S1 whereas AP5 depressed them. However, the effects of both substances disappeared immediately after administration had ended. L-NAME did not affect the level of ongoing activity and responses to S1 significantly. From these data, we concluded that, since the changes in the responses to S1 lasted longer than the periods of both whisker pairing and drug delivery, they were not residual excitatory or inhibitory drug effects on neuronal excitability. Thus, our results indicate that, relative to the unpaired controls, whisker pairing led to a 24% increase in the responsiveness of barrel cortex neurons to peripheral stimulation and that these changes were modulated by the local application of pharmacological agents that act upon NMDA receptors and pathways involving nitric oxide. We can infer that somatosensory cerebral cortex is one site where plasticity emerges following whisker pairing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Latent inhibition is a measure of retarded conditioning to a previously presented nonreinforced stimulus that is impaired in schizophrenic patients and in rats treated with amphetamine. In terms of neural substrates, latent inhibition depends on the integrity of the nucleus accumbens and the inputs to this structure from the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical areas. Since another major source of input to the nucleus accumbens is the medial prefrontal cortex, and there are numerous demonstrations that manipulations of this region can modify ventral striatal dopamine, we investigated the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate lesion to the medial prefrontal cortex on latent inhibition, assessed in an off-baseline conditioned emotional response procedure in rats licking for water. In addition, the effects of the medial prefrontal cortex lesion were assessed on a battery of tasks potentially sensitive to medial prefrontal cortex damage, including spontaneous and amphetamine-induced activity, elevated plus maze exploration, food hoarding, prepulse inhibition, and active avoidance. The lesion decreased hoarding behaviour and increased spontaneous exploratory activity in the open field, while exerting only mild effects on amphetamine-induced activity. Prepulse inhibition, exploration of the elevated plus maze, and the acquisition of two-way active avoidance were unaffected by the lesion.
   Likewise, latent inhibition was left intact following the lesion, suggesting that neither the destruction of the intrinsic cells of the medial prefrontal cortex nor any potential lesion-induced changes in subcortical dopamine, affect latent inhibition.

AB  - Evolutionary psychology has revolutionized research on human mate choice and Sexual attraction in recent years, combining a rigorous Darwinian framework based On sexual selection theory with a loosely cognitivist orientation: to task analysis and mechanism modelling. This hard Darwinian, soft computational approach. has been most successful at revealing the adaptive logic behind physical beauty, demonstrating that many:sexual cues computed from face and body shape are not arbitrary, but function as reliable indicators of phenotypic and genetic quality. The same approach could be extended from physical to psychological cues if evolutionary psychology built stronger ties with personality psychology, psychometrics and behavioral genetics. A major challenge for mate choice research is to develop more explicit computational models at three levels, specifying: (1) the perceptual adaptations that register sexual cues given sensory: input, (2) the judgment adaptations that integrate multiple cues into assessments of overall attractiveness, and (3) the search strategies that people follow in trying:to form mutually attracted pairs. We describe both recent efforts and possible extensions in these directions. The resulting confluence between evolutionary principles cognitive models and game-theoretic insights can put mate choice research at the vanguard of an. emerging 'evolutionary cognitive science' more concerned With domain-specific mental, adaptations than with domain-general intelligence.

AB  - Recent research has clarified and revealed characteristics of perceptual and motor decision processes in the brain. A democracy of sensory neurons discriminate the properties of a stimulus, while competition contrasts the attributes of stimuli across the visual field to locate conspicuous stimuli. Salience and significance are weighed to select an object on which to focus attention and action. Experimentally combining neural and mental chronometry has determined the contribution of perceptual and motor processes to the duration and variability of behavioral reaction time. Whereas perceptual processing occupies a relatively constant amount of time for a given stimulus condition, the processes of mapping particular stimuli onto the appropriate behavior and preparing the motor response provide flexibility but introduce delay and variability in reaction time.

AB  - Objectives-Shiftwork is now a major feature of working Life across a broad range of industries. The features of the shift systems operated can impact on the wellbeing, performance, and sleep of shiftworkers. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on one major characteristic of shift rotas-namely, shift duration. Evidence comparing the relative effects of eight hour and 12 hour shifts on fatigue and job performance, safety, sleep, and physical and psychological health are considered. At the organisational level, factors such as the mode of system implementation, attitudes towards shift rotas, sickness absence and turnover, overtime, and moonlighting are discussed.
   Methods-Manual and electronic searches of the shiftwork research literature were conducted to obtain information on comparisons between eight hour and 12 hour shifts.
   Results-The research findings are largely equivocal. The bulk of the evidence suggests few differences between eight and 12 hour shifts in the way they affect people. There may even be advantages to 12 hour shifts in terms of lower stress levels, better physical and psychological wellbeing, improved durations and quality of off duty sleep as well as improvements in family relations. On the negative side, the main concerns are fatigue and safety. It is noted that a 12 hour shift does not equate with being active for only 12 hours.
   Conclusions-There can be considerable extension of the person's time awake either side of the shift. However, the effects of longer term exposure to extended work days have been relatively uncharted in any systematic way. Longitudinal comparative research into the chronic impact of the compressed working week is needed.

AB  - Forty years of research into the function of L-glutamic acid as a neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) have uncovered a tremendous complexity in the actions of this excitatory neurotransmitter and an equally great complexity in the molecular structures of the receptors activated by L-glutamate. L-Glutamate is the most widespread excitatory transmitter system in the vertebrate CNS and in addition to its actions as a synaptic transmitter it produces long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability, synaptic structure and function, neuronal migration during development, and neuronal viability. These effects are produced through the activation of two general classes of receptors, those that form ion channels or "ionotropic" and chose that are linked to G-proteins or "metabotropic". The pharmacological and physiological characterization of these various forms over the past two decades has led to the definition of three forms of ionotropic receptors, the kainate (KA), AMPA, and NMDA receptors, and three groups of metabotropic receptors. Twenty-seven genes are now identified for specific subunits of these receptors and another five proteins are likely to function as receptor subunits or receptor associated proteins. The regulation of expression of these protein subunits, their localization in neuronal and glial membranes, and their role in determining the physiological properties of glutamate receptors is a fertile field of current investigations into the cell and molecular biology of these receptors. Both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors are linked in multiple intracellular messengers, such as Ca2+, cyclic AMP, reactive oxygen species, and initiate multiple signaling cascades that determine neuronal growth, differentiation and survival. These cascades of complex molecular events are presented in this review. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Prenatal development of the primary visual cortex leads to simple cells with spatially distinct and oriented ON and OFF subregions. These simple cells are organized into spatial maps of orientation and ocular dominance that exhibit singularities, fractures, and linear zones. On a finer spatial scale, simple cells occur that are sensitive to similar orientations but opposite contrast polarities, and exhibit both even-symmetric and odd-symmetric receptive fields. Pooling of outputs from oppositely polarized simple cells leads to complex cells that respond to both contrast polarities. A neural network model is described which simulates how simple and complex cells self-organize starting from unsegregated and unoriented geniculocortical inputs during prenatal development. Neighboring simple cells that are sensitive to opposite contrast polarities develop from a combination of spatially short-range inhibition and high-gain recurrent habituative excitation between cells that obey membrane equations. Habituation, or depression, of synapses controls reset of cell activations both through enhanced ON responses and OFF antagonistic rebounds. Orientation and ocular dominance maps form when high-gain medium-range recurrent excitation and long-range inhibition interact with the short-range mechanisms. The resulting structure clarifies how simple and complex cells contribute to perceptual processes such as texture segregation and perceptual grouping. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Maintenance treatments in bipolar disorders and schizophrenia are securely established, and their discontinuation is associated with high but modifiable risk of early relapse. The benefits of long-term antidepressant treatment in major depression and the risks of discontinuing medication at various times after clinical recovery from acute depression are not as well defined. Computerized searching found 27 studies with data on depression risk over time including a total of 3037 depressive patients treated for 5.78 (0-48) months and then followed for 16.6 (5-66) months with antidepressants continued or discontinued. Compared with patients whose antidepressants were discontinued, those with continued treatment showed much lower relapse rates (1.85 vs. 6.24%/month), longer time to 50% relapse (48.0 vs. 14.2 months), and lower 12-month relapse risk (19.5 vs. 44.8%) (all p < 0.001). However, longer prior treatment did not yield lower postdiscontinuation relapse risk, and differences in relapses off versus on antidepressants fell markedly with longer follow-up. Contrary to prediction, gradual discontinuation (dose-tapering or use of long-acting agents) did not yield lower relapse rates. Relapse risk was not associated with diagnostic criteria. More previous illness (particularly three or more prior episodes or a chronic course) was strongly associated with higher relapse risk after discontinuation of antidepressants but had no effect on response to continued treatment; patients with infrequent prior illness showed only minor relapse differences between drug and placebo treatment.

AB  - Double-blind trials conducted in the early 1980s showed that subcutaneous injections of salmon calcitonin in patients suffering from mania resulted in significant decreases in irritability, euphoria and hyperactivity. Although these results were promising, there were no follow-up studies in this area. A MEDLINE search into the effect of calcitonin on neuronal tissues revealed that calcitonin affects neuronal tissues in a manner similar to that of the currently accepted mood-stabilizing agents - namely by modulating intracellular second messenger signalling mechanisms, stabilizing neuronal membranes and inhibiting neuronal calcium influx We suggest that these effects of calcitonin on neuronal tissues, combined with earlier clinical research showing its efficacy in treating the acute symptoms of mania, make calcitonin a candidate for further research in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

AB  - Genetic variability is the clay of evolution, providing the base material on which adaptation and speciation depend. It is often assumed that most interspecific differences in variability are due primarily to population size effects, with bottlenecked populations carrying less variability than those of stable size. However, we show that population bottlenecks are unlikely to be the only factor, even in classic case studies such as the northern elephant seal and the cheetah, where genetic polymorphism is virtually absent. Instead, we suggest that the low levels of variability observed in endangered populations are more likely to result from a combination of publication biases, which tend to inflate the level of variability which is considered 'normal', and inbreeding effects, which may hasten loss of variability due to drift. To account for species with large population sizes but low variability we advance three hypotheses. First, it is known that certain metapopulation structures can result in effective population sizes far below the census size. Second, there is increasing evidence that heterozygous sites mutate more frequently than equivalent homozygous sites, plausibly because mismatch repair between homologous chromosomes during meiosis provides extra opportunities to mutate. Such a mechanism would undermine the simple relationship between heterozygosity and effective population size. Third, the fact that related species that differ greatly in variability implies that large amounts of variability can be gained or lost rapidly. We argue that such cases are best explained by rapid loss through a genome-wide selective sweep, and suggest a mechanism by which this could come about, based on forced changes to a control gene inducing coevolution in the genes it controls. Our model, based on meiotic drive in mammals, but easily extended to other systems, would tend to facilitate population isolation by generating molecular incompatabilities. Circumstances can even be envisioned in which the process could provide intrinsic impetus to speciation.

AB  - In recent decades, research on child and adolescent depression has proliferated. Currently, attention in the field is directed toward examining the epidemiology causes, course, sequelae, and treatment response of children at risk for developing or presently experiencing depressive disorders. In this article, a developmental psychopathology approach is used to elucidate the development of depressive disorders, the diverse pathways that evolve, and the processes that contribute to varied outcomes. The developmental psychopathology perspective underscores the importance of moving beyond the identification of isolated aberrations in psychological and biological components of depressive presentations to the understanding of how those components have evolved and how they are integrated within and transact across biological, psychological, and social systems. Implications for prevention and intervention are addressed as is the importance of increasing the public awareness of depressive disorders and reducing the social stigma that interfere with the attainment of treatment for depressed persons.

AB  - Extracellular nucleotides, particularly adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), act as signaling molecules in the inner ear. Roles as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and as autocrine or paracrine humoral factors are evident. The diversity of the signaling pathways for nucleotides, which include a variety of ATP-gated ion channels (assembled from different subtypes of P2X-receptor subunit) and also different subtypes of G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors (P2Y receptors) supports a major physiological role for ATP in the regulation of hearing and balance. Almost invariably both P2X and P2Y receptor expression is apparent in the complex tissue structures associated with the inner-ear labyrinth. However P2X-receptor expression, commonly associated with fast neurotransmission, is apparent not only with the cochlear and vestibular primary afferent neurons, but also appears to mediate humoral signaling via Am-gated ion channel localization to the endolymphatic surface of the cochlear sensory epithelium (organ of Corti). This is the site of the sound-transduction process and recent data, including both electrophysiological, imaging, and immunocytochemistry, has shown that the ATP-gated ion channels are colocalized here with the mechano-electrical transduction channels of the cochlear hair cells. In contrast to this direct action of extracellular ATP on the sound-transduction process, an indirect effect is apparent via P2Y-receptor expression, prevalent on the marginal cells of the stria vascularis, a tissue that generates the standing ionic and electrical gradients across the cochlear partition. The site of generation of these gradients, including the dark-cell epithelium of the vestibular labyrinth, may be under autocrine or paracrine regulation mediated by P2Y receptors sensitive to both purines (ATP) and pyrimidines such as UTP. There is also emerging evidence that the nucleoside adenosine, formed as a breakdown product of ATP by the action of ectonucleotidases and acting via P1 receptors, is also physiologically significant in the inner ear. P1-receptor expression (including A(1), A(2), and A(3) subtypes) appear to have roles associated with stress, acting alongside P2Y receptors to enhance cochlear blood flow and to protect against the action of free radicals and to modulate the activity of membrane conductances. Given the positioning of a diverse range of purinergic-signaling pathways within the inner ear, elevations of nucleotides and nucleosides are clearly positioned to affect hearing and balance. Recent data clearly supports endogenous ATP-and adenosine-mediated changes in sensory transduction via a regulation of the electrochemical gradients in the cochlea, alterations in the active and passive mechanical properties of the cells of the sensory epithelium, effects on primary afferent neurons, and control of the blood supply. The field now awaits conclusive evidence linking a physiologically-induced modulation of extracellular nucleotide and nucleoside levels to altered inner ear function.

AB  - It has been clear for almost two decades that cortical representations in adult animals are not fixed entities, but rather, are dynamic and are continuously modified by experience. The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood.
   In parallel with developments in the field of cortical map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity.

AB  - The search for novel neurotransmitters and neuropeptides has been recently revolutionized by the development of a purification strategy based on orphan G protein-coupled receptors, cloned receptors for which no natural ligands are known. This strategy uses the orphan receptor as bait to identify its natural ligand. This article will review the discovery of the first natural ligand isolated following this strategy. This ligand is a peptide that shares some striking sequence similarity to the opioid peptides and has been named Orphanin FQ or Nociceptin (OFQ/NOC). The discovery of OFQ/NOC will be described as one example of the use of orphan receptors in identifying novel neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, an example that has already been followed in the identification of other novel neuropeptides. After reviewing the conceptual and technological basis of the strategy and its successful first application, we discuss the criteria used to validate OFQ/NOC as the natural ligand of the orphan receptor and as a genuine neuropeptide. We also discuss the importance and implications of discovering OFQ/NOC mode of synthesis, which is synthesized as expected in the form of a larger polypeptide precursor, which in turn raises the question of the existence of other OFQ/NOC-related peptides. We then present an overview of the numerous studies that have blossomed after the OFQ/NOC discovery and describe the numerous physiological roles that have already been attributed to OFQ/NOC, and in particular the controversy regarding its involvement in pain perception. Because of the similarities between the OFQ/NOC and opioid systems, we also discuss overlaps between these systems and present evidence favoring a pharmacological separation between these systems. We finish by outlining the power of the orphan receptor strategy and by discussing some of its pitfalls.

AB  - Objective: Polypharmacy is common in the treatment of refractory bipolar disorder. The purpose of this article is to review the safety and efficacy of mood stabilizers in combinations. Method: A manual and computer (MEDLINE) search was performed for combinations of the most commonly used mood-stabilizing agents. Results: The authors review safety aid efficacy data on the more frequently encountered combinations of established and putative moon stabilizers. Conclusions: There have been few controlled studies of the use of combinations of mood stabilizers. The interactions of such combinations are sometimes complex, often very useful, and potentially dangerous. One general rule that may reduce the risks of toxic drug interactions is to add medication to the patient's current regimen in modest doses and increase the dose slowly. The safest and most efficacious mood stabilizer combinations appear to be the mixtures of anticonvulsants and lithium, particularly valproate plus lithium. Once the mechanisms of the mood stabilizers are identified, it is possible that a more rational approach to combination therapy will emerge, based on synergism at the sites of action.

AB  - Although from a review of the literature, comprising about 500 cases in more than 250 papers, seems to emerge a rather homogeneous picture of the disorder, the views on some clinical data, frequency, age of onset, course, prognosis, nosological classification, underlying illnesses and pathogenesis of "chronic tactile hallucinosis" are partly different and controversial. The syndrome is until today not sufficiently known in psychiatry, because the great majority of the patients do not search for psychiatric help. The most important data of the literature are discussed by means of the findings in a sample of 36 own patients. The patients are female more often than male (2.3:1 in the own sample), between 25 and 84 years of age. but in 81% beginning after the age of 50. The onset is in 19% of the own sample, and here exclusively in endogenous psychoses, before the age of 50. As to the nosological classification, the disorder develops in the half of the Bonn sample in the course of endogenous, mainly schizophrenic psychoses, in the other half based on organic (vascular) brain diseases. In endogenous psychoses the course is mainly in phases and not chronic or progressing as reported by Bers and Conrad. The data speak for the assumption that qualitatively abnormal bodily sensations, i.e. level-2-cenesthesias. often preceding in long prodromes the proper tactile hallucinosis, are an essential component in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. These sensation agree psychopathologically with bodily experiences that occur in schizophrenic courses and, as dominating symptomatology. in the cenesthetic type of schizophrenia. There are also symptomatic cases based on tumors in the area of the limbic system. As well cenesthesias as tactile hallucinations occur phenomenologically not distinguishable: as "thalamic spontaneous sensations" in circumscribed affections of the diencephalon. Our explanation of the development of tactile hallucinosis corresponds to the concept of the development of somatic hallucinations and other first rank symptoms of schizophrenia out of transition relevant basic symptoms, i.e. cognitive thought, perception, action and cenesthetic disorders, as defined in the BSABS. The disorder may remain unchanged for many years. but. there are also complete or partial remissions with or without pharmacological therapy. In the Bonn patients this has been observed in about the half (52%) of the sample and especially in the group with onset before 60, which includes mainly schizophrenic (rarely affective) psychoses. We conclude that the delusion to be infested with parasites is based on a tactile hallucinosis, developing out of cenesthesias, and that underlie either organic. mainly vascular brain disorders or endogenous psychoses. i.e, fully developed or abortive forms of schizophrenia or depressive affective psychoses.

   Conclusions: Although rare, CADASIL is probably under diagnosed. Migraine, especially with aura, is a common and early manifestation of CADASIL. Other symptoms include young-age stroke, early vascular dementia, and mood disorder. High index of suspicion is a diagnostic key for early diagnosis which can be confirmed by a genetic study. A recent genetic study found a mutation on chromosome 19 (Notch 3). Differential diagnosis includes multiple sclerosis, migraine with aura with nonspecific MRI changes, mitochondrial disease, Binswanger disease, and multi-infarct dementia. Further studies on treatment is warranted.

AB  - Then is a high rate of depression in patients with medical or other psychiatric disorders. This comorbid depression is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality from medical illness, poor compliance with treatment, a worsening of somatic symptoms, and often a decrease in functional status. Several recent studies have demonstrated that comorbid depression is highly treatable and that effective treatment often enhances patients' adaptive coping with medical illness. However, when choosing antidepressant therapy, care must be taken to evaluate the patient's illness fully and to avoid potential drug-drug interactions and drug-related illness. This review investigates the use of antidepressants in depressed patients with medical and psychiatric disorders and their effect on prognosis and morbidity, and suggests that there is a place for the use of antidepressant medications in the treatment of comorbid conditions. Generally. the greater safety and tolerability of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provides improved options for the treatment of depression in the medically and psychiatrically ill.

AB  - In fish, pre-embryonic events such as insemination, second polar body extrusion and first mitotic cleavage are manipulable and render 37 different types of ploidy induction possible. A classification of physical, chemical, and biological inductors of ploidy is provided. The amazing ability of fish to tolerate genomes from haploid to heptaploid, genomic contributions from the male or female parent alone, and unequal contributions from parents belonging to the same or different species is highlighted: surprisingly, a single species is amenable for 8-12 different types of ploidy induction. Advantages and limitations of different methods and live or preserved tissues for ploidy confirmation are assessed.
   Live haploids have been induced in Oreochromis mossambicus. With an ability to synthesize rRNAs and metabolic enzymes such as LDH, the haploid embryos are capable of normal translation and transcription, but suffer mass mortality at hatching, perhaps due to expression of lethal mutant genes.
   Induction of gynogenesis involves egg activation by irradiated homologous or heterologous sperm, and diploidization by retention of the second polar body (meiotic gynogenesis), or suppression of the first mitotic cleavage (mitotic gynogenesis). UV-irradiation inactivates sperm DNA maximally and avoids chromosome fragmentation. Egg activation by UV-irradiated heterologous sperm under dark conditions, and diploidization by pressure shock result in the highest survival of gynogens; meiotic gynogens survive better than mitotic gynogens. The need for confirmation of genetic purity of mitotic gynogens by one or more methods is emphasized. In different species, survival, growth and fertility improve when gynogens are generated successively for two or more generations.
   Combinations of induction of ploidy and hormonal sex reversal in gynogens renders the scope for generating all-male or all-female populations. In some gynogenetic species genetic homozygosity leads to growth suppression from 3 to 60%; however, meiotic gynogens of Clarias macrocephalus and Paralicthys olivaceus display 18 and 35% faster growth. Hypotheses for the unexpected occurrence of males among natural and artificially induced gynogenetic populations are assessed. In a few species, reproductive performance of gynogens is not equivalent to normal females.
   Maximal elimination of egg genome by UV-radiation, induction of androgenesis using 2n sperm of a tetraploid, facilitation of dispermy using heterologous eggs, and activation by cryopreserved sperm are land-mark events in the history of androgenesis. In male-heterogametic species, androgenesis may produce supermales to establish broodstock for consistent production of air-male populations. In combination with cryopreservation of sperm, androgenesis may prove to be the best method for conservation of fish genomes.
   As many as 11 different types of triploids are inducible; and most of them require the retention of the second polar body. The yield and survival of triploids are higher than those of gynogens and these values decrease with the kind of inductor used in the following order: pressure < cold < heat shock. Usually triploidy confers sterility, especially in females, and accelerates growth during post-maturation, when reared solitarily in some (Tinca tinca, Oreochromis Mossambicus) or communally (with diploids) in other species (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
   The presence of two sets of maternal chromosomes does not disturb the manifestation of morphological sexual characters; however, unexpected sex ratios observed in some triploids indicate a preponderance of females in natural populations and a dominance of males in artificially induced populations. In some species, a certain percentage of female triploids are fertile. possible pathways, through which the natural fertile triploids may form the base for evolution of tetraploids and origin of diploid new species are suggested. Triploids, especially females, suffer delayed maturity, a low gonado-somatic index, and disrupted gametogenesis due to cytogenetic and endocrine incompatibilities; males do not suffer endocrine incompatibility Three possible pathways, through which oogenesis may be completed in these fertile triploid species, are indicated. Triploid hybridization between salmonids, which can tolerate salinity changes (e.g. chum and pink salmons) and which cannot tolerate early transfer to sea water but are desired for their meat quality (e.g. Atlantic, chinook and coho salmons) is commercially important.
   Triploid conspecific salmonids grow faster than diploid conspecifics or triploid hybrids. Protocols for the combination of induced ploidy and hormonal sex reversal to generate all-male, all-female or all-sterile triploid populations are described. In triploids, the increase in nuclear DNA per cell is 1.3 to 1.7 times that of diploids, which results in corresponding volumetric increase of a cell. This, in rum, imposes corresponding decreases in total cell surface area and cell number of a tissue or a triploid individual; however, such a decrease in cell surface area does not impair metabolic processes like oxygen uptake and food utilization. Data for effective temperature required to induce cold or heat shock to retain the second polar body suggest that an elevation of 18, 15 and 14 degrees C successfully retains the polar body in salmonids, cyprinids and cichlids; the corresponding values for the depression of temperature are 11, 19 and 21 degrees C, respectively.
   Seven different kinds of tetraploidy are inducible; however, live, feeding tetraploids have been induced in ten species only. Causes for embryonic or post-embryonic mortality of tetraploids are discussed. Increasing maternal genomic contribution and heterologous insemination appear to enhance tetraploid survival. Survival and growth of Oncorhynchus mykiss progressively improve in F-1 and F-2 tetraploid progenies. In a rare strain of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, pentaploids, hexaploids and heptaploids have been successfully induced. An individual polyploid leach (3n) simultaneously spawns small, intermediate and large eggs carrying n, 2n and 3n genomes. It is not clear how during oogenesis the passage of n, 2n and 3n genomes is regulated into small, intermediate and large eggs. However, evidence from other fish species is accumulating for the simultaneous production of at least two kinds of eggs by a single female. Studies on ploidy induction have shown the magnitude of the complicated genetic mechanisms that control sex determination in fish.

AB  - The newly defined field of cognitive neuroscience attempts to draw together the study of all brain mechanisms that underlie our mental life. Historically, the major sensory pathways have provided the most trustworthy insights into how the brain supports cognitive functions such as perception, attention, and short-term memory. The links between neural activity and perception, in particular, have been studied revealingly in recent decades. Here we review the striking progress in this area, giving particular emphasis to the kinds of neural events that underlie the perceptual judgments of conscious observers.

AB  - The primary objectives of this article are (a) to put forth an explicit operational formulation of positive human health that goes beyond prevailing "absence of illness" criteria; (b) to clarify that positive human health does not derive from extant medical considerations, which are not about wellness, but necessarily require a base in philosophical accounts of the "goods" in life; (c) to provoke a change of emphasis from strong tendencies to construe human health as exclusively about the mind or the body toward an integrated and positive spiral of mind-body influences; (d) to delineate possible physiological substrates of human flourishing and offer future directions for understanding the biology of positive health; and (e) to discuss implications of positive health for diverse scientific agendas (e.g., stress, class and health, work and family life) and for practice in health fields (e.g., training, health examinations, psychotherapy, and wellness intervention programs).

AB  - The significant role which sport and exercise continues to play in our daily lives cannot be denied. The huge sport and leisure industries, not to mention massive individual investments of time, effort, money, energy and emotion, each bear witness to this fact. However, sport and exercise, like gender itself, is rarely presented as a topic of study within general psychology courses or accorded a great deal of attention in psychology textbooks. By synthesising the diverse literature on gender issues in sport and exercise, we provide an overview of current research and offer suggestions for future directions. Initially, the study of gender issues in sport and exercise psychology is placed in historical context. A second section outlines major theoretical perspectives adopted by sport psychologists in addition to highlighting contemporary research within the field. The final section explores possible future directions which are largely based in the rapidly expanding field of exercise psychology.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in both normal aging and in various neurodegenerative disorders and may be a common mechanism underlying various forms of cell death including necrosis, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity. In this review, we develop the hypothesis that oxidative stress-mediated neuronal loss may be initiated by a decline in the antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH). GSH plays multiple roles in the nervous system including free radical scavenger, redox modulator of ionotropic receptor activity, and possible neurotransmitter. GSH depletion can enhance oxidative stress and may also increase the levels of excitotoxic molecules; both types of action can initiate cell death in distinct neuronal populations. Evidence for a role of oxidative stress and diminished GSH status is presented for Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Potential links to the Guamanian variant of these diseases (ALS-PD complex) are discussed. In context to the above, we provide a GSH-depletion model of neurodegenerative disorders, suggest experimental verifications of this model, and propose potential therapeutic approaches for preventing or halting these diseases.

AB  - Objective: The blood platelet has been proposed as a model of central neurons and may therefore be used as a peripheral marker of psychiatric illness. One method of investigating serotonin function in panic disorder has relied on the use of the platelet as a model of serotonergic neurons. This article reviews the studies of platelet function in panic disorder.
   Method: A literature search and review of relevant papers was undertaken.
   Result: Studies examining platelet serotonin uptake and concentration in panic disorder patients have to date yielded conflicting results, with some investigators reporting increased serotonin uptake, others reduced uptake. Similarly studies of platelet H-3-imipramine binding have also yielded conflicting results. Two studies of platelet H-3-paroxetine binding have shown a reduction in the density of binding sites (max) in patients with panic disorder. platelet monoamine oxidase activity in anxiety disorders has been reported to be increased by some investigators but decreased by others. Methodological considerations may have been responsible for these differences. Finally, studies of alpha(2) adrenoceptor density have also produced contrasting findings.
   Conclusion: The findings of these studies indicate that platelet function is altered in panic disorder. Such changes may allow an insight into the biochemical aetiology of the illness. Further studies are required to delineate the role of serotonin and non-adrenaline in panic disorder.

AB  - Mental retardation occurs in more than 1 % of the child population. A cause can be found in almost 80 % of individuals with severe mental retardation, but in fewer than 40 % of those with mild mental retardation. A work-up is indicated in all cases of mental retardation. A medical doctor with specific training in the field is needed to make "decision-tree diagnosis" and to suggest the most appropriate physical investigations in each case. This paper provides practical guidelines for diagnosis and work-up both in severe and mild mental retardation.

AB  - The authors address 2 questions about embarrassment, First, is embarrassment a distinct emotion? The evidence indicates that the antecedents, experience, and display of embarrassment, and to a limited extent its autonomic physiology, are distinct from shame, guilt, and amusement and share the dynamic, temporal characteristics of emotion. Second,What are the theoretical accounts of embarrassment? Three accounts focus on the causes of embarrassment, positing that it follows the loss of self-esteem, concern for others' evaluations, or absence of scripts to guide interactions. A fourth account focuses on the effects of the remedial actions of embarrassment which correct preceding transgressions, A fifth account focuses on the functional parallels between embarrassment and nonhuman appeasement. The discussion focuses on unanswered questions about embarrassment.

AB  - Removal of extracellular glutamate at synapses, by specific high-affinity glutamate transporters. is critical to prevent excitotoxic injury to neurons. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of an array of prominent neurodegenerative conditions that involve degeneration of synapses and neurons in glutamatergic pathways including stroke, and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Although cell culture data indicate that oxidative insults can impair key membrane regulatory systems including. ion-motive ATPases and amino acid transport systems, the effects of oxidative stress on synapses, and the mechanisms that mediate such effects, are largely unknown. This study provides evidence that 4-hydroxynonenal, an aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation, mediates oxidation-induced impairment of glutamate transport and mitochondrial function in synapses. Exposure of rat cortical synaptosomes to 4-hydroxynonenal resulted in concentration-and time-dependent decreases in [H-3]glutamate uptake, and mitochondrial function [assessed with the dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)]. Other related aldehydes including malondialdehyde and hexanal had little or no effect on glutamate uptake or mitochondrial function. Exposure of synaptosomes to insults known to induce lipid peroxidation (FeSO4 and amyloid beta-peptide) also impaired glutamate uptake and mitochondrial Function. The antioxidants propyl gallate and glutathione prevented impairment of glutamate uptake and MTT reduction induced by FeSO4 and amyloid beta-peptide, but not that induced by 4-hydroxynonenal. Western blot analyses using an antibody to 4-hydroxynonenal-conjugated proteins showed that 4-hydroxynonenal bound to multiple cell proteins including GLT-1, a glial glutamate transporter present al high levels in synaptosomes. 4-Hydroxynonenal itself induced lipid peroxidation suggesting that, in addition to binding directly to membrane regulatory proteins, 4-hydroxynonenal potentiates oxidative cascades.
   Collectively, these findings suggest that 4-hydroxynonenal plays important roles in oxidative impairment of synaptic functions that would be expected to promote excitotoxic cascades. (C) 1997 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Further simulations of human multiple-task performance have been conducted with computational models that are based on the executive-process interactive control (EPIC) architecture introduced by D. E. Meyer and D. E. Kieras (1997a). These models account well for patterns of reaction times and psychological refractory-period phenomena (delays of overt responses after short stimulus onset asynchronies) observed in a variety of laboratory paradigms and realistic situations. This supports the claim of the present theoretical framework that multiple-task performance relies on adaptive executive control, which enables substantial amounts of temporal overlap among stimulus identification, response selection, and movement-production processes for concurrent tasks. Such overlap is achieved through optimized task scheduling by flexible executive processes that satisfy prevailing instructions about task priorities and allocate limited-capacity perceptual-motor resources efficiently.

AB  - Evidence suggests that major depression and ischemic heart disease commonly co-occur and that depressive symptoms have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis. A Medline search was conducted to obtain articles published between 1966 and 1996 that address the association between depressive disorders and coronary artery disease. We used systematic epidemiologic criteria to examine the strength of this association. There is convincing evidence that in patients with coronary artery disease, depressive disorders are common and are associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association, including alterations in autonomic function leading to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Despite the evidence that their comorbid presence is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, depressive disorders in patients with coronary artery disease are often underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. At the very least, randomized treatment trials are indicated.

AB  - Research into the biological bases of human intelligence differences is surveyed. Work on brain event-related potentials (ERPs) suggests that people with high IQ test scores: (1) show faster responses in some test conditions; (2) have ERP waveforms that can be distinguished from those of people with tower IQs; and (3) might have less variability in their ERPs. People with higher psychometric intelligence have, on average, larger brains, and possibly faster neural conduction speed. A few small functional brain-scanning studies suggest that, in healthy individuals, people who are of higher IQ have lower cerebral metabolic rates during mentally active conditions. This has led to the speculation that brighter people have more efficient brains. Despite some well-replicated findings in the search for the 'biology of human intelligence' there is a dearth of explanatory accounts to link cognitive performance differences with variance in brain mechanisms.

AB  - Over the past 20 years there has been an increasing understanding of the properties and mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy, putative learning and memory mechanisms in the mammalian brain. More recently, however, it has become apparent that synaptic activity can also elicit persistent neuronal responses not manifest as changes in synaptic strength. Some of these changes may nonetheless modify the ability of synapses to undergo strength changes in response to subsequent episodes of synaptic activity. This kind of activity-dependent modulatory plasticity we have termed ''metaplasticity''. Metaplasticity has been observed physiologically as an inhibition of LTP and concomitant facilitation of LTD by prior N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation or, conversely, a facilitation of LTP induction by prior metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. The examples of metaplasticity described to date are input specific, and last as long as several hours. The mechanisms underlying such phenomena remain to be fully characterized, although some likely possibilities are an altered N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function, altered calcium buffering, altered states of kinases or phosphatases, and a priming of protein synthesis machinery. While some details vary, experimentally observed metaplasticity bears some similarity to the ''sliding theshold'' feature of the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro model of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Metaplasticity may serve several functions including (1) providing a way for synapses to integrate a response across temporally spaced episodes of synaptic activity and (2) keeping synapses within a dynamic functional range, and thus preventing them from entering slates of saturated LTP or LTD.

AB  - Suicide ranked as the ninth leading cause of death in the United States in 1992, with persons over the age of 65 years being at the highest risk. Suicidologists predict a dramatic increase in both the rate and the total number of rate-life suicides over the next three decades, highlighting the urgent need for prevention and treatment strategies specifically targeting at-risk order individuals. Comprehensive Medline and PsycLit searches of elderly suicide (and various synonyms thereof) were conducted for English-language publications dating back to 1989, and the bibliographies in these sources were examined for additional publications. An overview of the epidemiology, biology, psychopathology, and frequent medical concomitants of late-rife suicide is presented here. innovative preventive strategies are also briefly summarized. It is concluded that further investigation is needed in several areas: the neurobiology of aging, affective disorders, and suicide; the complex interactions between somatic and psychiatric illnesses; personality traits that may confer vulnerability to suicide in late life; and age-related variations in the prevalence and phenomenology of Axis I psychopathology in suicide victims.

AB  - The Y-receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and mediate a wide variety of physiological effects, such as regulation of blood pressure, anxiety, memory retention, hormone release and food intake. Since the first human Y-receptor was cloned in 1992, the search for additional subtypes has been an area of intense study. Recently four new NPY-receptor subtypes have been isolated, revealing surprisingly limited sequence identity with values as low as 30%. Several reports indicate further heterogeneity of this receptor family, for example a peripheral Y-2 receptor. However, since many studies have been carried out with different peptide analogs and radioligands in different species, there is substantial confusion regarding the pharmacological profile of the receptors. This may have led to an exaggeration of the potential number of discrete receptors.

AB  - Several electrophysiological studies have addressed the interaction between glutamate and dopamine within the striatum. Although the results obtained from these studies were often conflicting, more recently the characterization of new forms of synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia provided a possible integrative explanation of the different electrophysiological data regarding the interaction between these transmitters. In this review we will try to summarize and discuss the available data concerning the possible impact of the functional role of D1 and D2 receptor activation on the modulation of the glutamatergic corticostriatal pathway. Moreover, we will also describe the function of the striatum in the integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to produce long term changes of synaptic efficacy (long-term depression, long-term potentiation). Finally, we will consider the implication of the interaction between dopamine and glutamate in the regulation of energetic metabolism whose failure is responsible for neuronal death.

AB  - Glutamate receptors play a major role in the transmitter balance within the basal ganglia (BG). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor stimulation within the striatum acts behaviourally depressant while intrastriatal as well as systemic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists have rather stimulatory effects despite the different profiles of non-competitive-, competitive NMDA receptor- and glycine site-antagonists.
   In animal models of Parkinson's disease all these NMDA receptor antagonists counteract parkinsonian symptoms or act synergistically with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). The strong locomotion-inducing effect of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists is partly, but not fully, mediated by a dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens. Manipulations at alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors produce poor behavioural effects. These, however, are different or even opposed to NMDA receptor mediated effects. Local infusions of AMPA receptor antagonists into the BG output nuclei have an antiparkinsonian effect but systemic injections are ineffective. These drugs even counteract the anti-parkinsonian effect of DA agonists and of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists as well as the DA releasing effects of the latter drugs.
   Only few data on the role of metabotropic receptors exist but the different receptor subtypes with different regional distribution represent a promising target for pharmacological interventions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The author-advances a taxonomy of expert evidence in relation to the responses of sexually abused children to their assaults. He analyses a series of Australian and New Zealand cases in the context of Summit's publicly stated recent views on the use to which Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (''CSAAS'') can be put. He argues that expert evidence that goes further than dispelling myths or disabusing triers of fact of misperceptions generally held within the community should not be permitted. He contends that CSAAS is an illegitimate description of such information and that such ''syndrome evidence)) should not be permitted, particularly before juries. He maintains, moreover, that further rigour will be (and should be) required of prosecutors and mental health professionals alike if such counterintuitive evidence is to be admitted. This will entail proof of the existence of community misunderstanding of the phenomenon, establishment that the field of expertise from which child sexual abuse accommodation evidence emanates is sufficient for the purpose, as well as proof of the expert's expertise in the held. However, he argues against abandoning attempts to use counterintuitive evidence merely on the basis of a number of adverse Australasian determinations, whose reasoning is dependent on the quality of the evidence hitherto advanced and the overly limited perceptions of the evidential framework within which such evidence should be evaluated.

AB  - Accounts of the identification of words and talkers commonly rely on different acoustic properties. To identify a word, a perceiver discards acoustic aspects of an utterance that are talker specific, forming an abstract representation of the linguistic message with which to probe a mental lexicon. To identify a talker, a perceiver discards acoustic aspects of an utterance specific to particular phonemes, creating a representation of voice quality with which to search for familiar talkers in long-term memory. In 3 experiments, sinewave replicas of natural speech sampled from 10 talkers eliminated natural voice quality while preserving idiosyncratic phonetic variation. Listeners identified the sinewave talkers without recourse to acoustic attributes of natural voice quality. This finding supports a revised description of speech perception in which the phonetic properties of utterances serve to identify both words and talkers.

   Results: With the advent of newer antidepressants, physicians have been given a wider range of generally safer antidepressant medications. Although these medications appear to have a more favourable side effect profile in elderly patients, this review is limited because there are few published studies of the use of these newer antidepressants in the elderly.
   Conclusion: Depression is a common psychiatric problem in old age, but it can usually be treated successfully. Although the use of antidepressants in geriatric populations is more likely to be complicated by poorly tolerated side effects and drug interactions than in younger patients, this review should help clinicians use currently available medications to the best advantage of their geriatric patients.

AB  - The aim of this review is to connect the phenomenology of consciousness to its neurobiology. A survey of the recent literature revealed the following points. (1) Comprehensive descriptions of consciousness, of its subjective as well as of its objective aspects, are both possible and necessary for its scientific study. An intentionality-modeling structure (an unified and stable ego refers to objects or to itself in the framework of a stable, reproducible, predictable world) accounts for the main features. (2) The material basis of consciousness can be clarified without recourse to new properties of matter or to quantum physics. Current neurobiology appears to be able to handle the problem. In fact, the neurobiology of consciousness is already in progress, and has achieved substantial results. At the system level, its main sources of data are: the neurophysiology of sleep-wakefulness, brain imaging of mental representations, attention and working memory, the neuropsychology of frontal syndrome, and awareness-unawareness dissociations in global amnesia and different forms of agnosia. At an intermediate level of organization, the mechanisms of consciousness may be the formation of a certain kind of neural assembly. (3) Further research may focus on neuropsychology and neurophysiology of object perception and recognition as a natural model of intentionality, perception of time, body schema, interhemispheric communications, 'voluntary' acts and mental images. The synthetic and dynamic views provided by brain imaging may be decisive for discovering the neural correlates of the integrative aspects of consciousness. (4) The neurobiological approach may, beyond the finding of cellular and molecular mechanisms, improve the general concepts of consciousness, overcome their antinomies and, against epiphenomenalism, definitely establish the reality of consciousness.

   Conclusions: Video games have some adverse effects, but they are also valuable learning tools. Research about the role of video games is inadequate. The data are also limited by the lack of long-term studies and inconsistent findings.

AB  - The effects of electrolytic lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or its subregions were investigated on two cognitive tests that may have relevance to the behavioral impairments of patients with schizophrenia. One task consisted of a delayed nonmatch-to-sample and reversal of the non-match-to-sample rule, in a Skinner box. The reversal component simulated the essential feature of rule shifting of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which is a commonly used test for assessing 'frontal-like' deficits in schizophrenia. The second was latent inhibition, in which repeated pre-exposure to a stimulus without consequence retards subsequent associations with that stimulus. Latent inhibition is impaired in acute schizophrenic patients, and its disruption in the rat has been suggested to constitute an animal model of schizophrenia. Expts. 1 and 2 tested the effects of lesions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACA) and mPFC, respectively, on the WCST analog. Expt. 3 tested the effects of lesions of the dACA or infralimbic cortex, and Expt. 4 tested the effects of mPFC lesion, on latent inhibition. Lesions of mPFC subregions had no effect. mPFC lesion produced transient deficits in the performance of the DNMS task and impaired the reversal from the non-match-to-sample to the match-to-sample rule, but left the latent inhibition effect intact. Possible relevance of this behavioral profile of mPFC lesion to the 'frontal syndrome' is discussed.

TI  - Mental states in animals: cognitive ethology
AB  - This article addresses the question of mental states in animals as viewed in 'cognitive ethology'. In effect, this field of research aims at studying naturally occurring behaviours such as food caching, individual recognition, imitation, tool use and communication in wild animals, in order to seek for evidence of mental experiences, self-awareness and intentionality. Cognitive ethologists use some philosophical concepts (e.g., the 'intentional stance') to carry out their programme of the investigation of natural behaviours. A comparison between cognitive ethology and other approaches to the investigation of cognitive processes in animals (e.g., experimental animal psychology) helps to point out the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive ethology. Moreover, laboratory attempts to analyse experimentally intentional behaviours such as deception, the relationship between seeing and knowing, as well as the ability of animals to monitor their own states of knowing, suggest that cognitive ethology could benefit significantly from the conceptual frameworks and methods of animal cognitive psychology. Both disciplines could, in fact, contribute to the understanding of which cognitive abilities are evolutionary adaptations.

AB  - In this paper we develop a conceptual framework for selecting stressor data and analyzing their relationship to geographic patterns of species richness at large spatial scales, Aspects of climate and topography, which are not stressors per se, have been most strongly linked with geographic patterns of species richness at large spatial scales (e.g., continental to global scales). The adverse impact of stressors (e.g., habitat loss, pollution) on species has been demonstrated primarily on much smaller spatial scales. To date, there has been a lack of conceptual development on how to use stressor data to study geographic patterns of species richness at large spatial scales.
   The framework we developed includes four components: (1) clarification of the terms stress and stressor and categorization of factors affecting species richness into three groups-anthropogenic stressors, natural stressors, and natural covariates; (2) synthesis of the existing hypotheses for explaining geographic patterns of species richness to identify the scales over which stressors and natural covariates influence species richness and to provide supporting evidence for these relationships through review of previous studies; (3) identification of three criteria for selection of stressor and covariate data sets: (a) inclusion of data sets from each of the three categories identified in item 1, (b) inclusion of data sets representing different aspects of each category, and (c) to the extent possible, analysis of data quality; and (4) identification of two approaches for examining scale-dependent relationships among stressors, covariates, and patterns of species richness-scaling-up and regression-tree analyses.
   Based on this framework, we propose 10 data sets as a minimum data base for examining the effects of stressors and covariates on species richness at large spatial scales. These data sets include land cover, roads, wetlands (numbers and loss), exotic species, livestock grazing, surface water pH, pesticide application, climate (and weather), topography, and streams.

AB  - Adolescents are often vulnerable to particular health risks and face multiple barriers to accessing health care. School-based clinics and school-linked services represent an alternative model of care that has responded to the unique health issues of adolescents by offering preventive, comprehensive services, including mental health and other sensitive services. The current restructuring of the American health care delivery system presents a serious challenge to the continued existence of these services, which must link successfully with managed care organizations and adapt to significant changes in federal and state funding streams to remain viable. The continued success of school-based health services in improving adolescent health will largely depend on how well they can capitalize on their strategic position to reach adolescents, respond to their health needs, and reduce barriers to care, and how effectively they can integrate themselves into a rapidly evolving US health care delivery system.

AB  - Zinc is an important trace element in biology. An important pool of zinc in the brain is the one present in synaptic vesicles in a subgroup of glutamatergic neurons. In this form it can be released by electrical stimulation and may serve to modulate responses at receptors for a number of different neurotransmitters. These include both excitatory and inhibitory receptors, particularly the NMDA and GABA(A) receptors. This pool of zinc is the only form of zinc readily stained histochemically (the chelatable zinc pool), but constitutes only about 8% of the total zinc content in the brain. The remainder of the zinc is more or less tightly bound to proteins where it acts either as a component of the catalytic site of enzymes or in a structural capacity. The metabolism of zinc in the brain is regulated by a number of transport proteins, some of which have been recently characterized by gene cloning techniques. The intracellular concentration may be mediated both by efflux from the cell by the zinc transporter ZrT1 and by complexing with apothionein to form metallothionein. Metallothionein may serve as the source of zinc for incorporation into proteins, including a number of DNA transcription factors. However, zinc is readily released from metallothionein by disulfides, increasing concentrations of which are formed under oxidative stress. Metallothionein is a very good scavenger of free radicals, and zinc itself can also reduce oxidative stress by binding to thiol groups, decreasing their oxidation. Zinc is also a very potent inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Increased levels of chelatable zinc have been shown to be present in cell cultures of immune cells undergoing apoptosis. This is very reminiscent of the zinc staining of neuronal perikarya dying after an episode of ischemia or seizure activity. Thus a possible role of zinc in causing neuronal death in the brain needs to be fully investigated. Intraventricular injections of calcium EDTA have already been shown to reduce neuronal death after a period of ischemia. Pharmacological doses of zinc cause neuronal death, and some estimates indicate that extracellular concentrations of zinc could reach neurotoxic levels under pathological conditions. Zinc is released in high concentrations from the hippocampus during seizures. Unfortunately, there are contrasting observations as to whether this zinc serves to potentiate or decrease seizure activity. Zinc may have an additional role in causing death in at least some neurons damaged by seizure activity and be involved in the sprouting phenomenon which may give rise to recurrent seizure propagation in the hippocampus.
   In Alzheimer's disease, zinc has been shown to aggregate beta-amyloid, a form which is potentially neurotoxic. The zinc-dependent transcription factors NF-kappa B and Sp1 bind to the promoter region of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. Zinc also inhibits enzymes which degrade APP to nonamyloidogenic peptides and which degrade the soluble form of beta-amyloid. The changes in zinc metabolism which occur during oxidative stress may be important in neurological diseases where oxidative stress is implicated, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Zinc is a structural component of superoxide dismutase 1, mutations in which give rise to one form of familiar ALS. After HIV infection, zinc deficiency is found which may be secondary to immune-induced cytokine synthesis. Zinc is involved in the replication of the HIV virus at a number of sites. These observations should stimulate further research into the role of zinc in neuropathology. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB  - To begin to study the importance of dopamine for executive function abilities dependent on prefrontal cortex during early childhood, the present investigation studied children in whom we predicted reduced dopamine in prefrontal cortex but otherwise normal brains. These are children treated early and continuously for the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU). Untreated PKU is the most common biochemical cause of mental retardation. The root problem is an inability to convert one amino acid, phenylalanine (Phe), into another, tyrosine (Tyr), the precursor of dopamine. Phe levels in the bloodstream soar; Tyr levels fall. Treatment with a diet low in Phe reduces the Phe:Tyr imbalance but cannot eliminate it. We hypothesized that the resultant modest elevation in the ratio of Phe to Tyr in the blood, which results in slightly less Tyr reaching the brain, uniquely affects the cognitive functions dependent on prefrontal cortex because of the special sensitivity of prefrontally projecting dopamine neurons to small decreases in Tyr.
   In a 4-year longitudinal study, we found that PKU children whose plasma Phe levels were three to five times normal (6-10 mg/dl) performed worse than other PKU children with lower Phe levels, matched controls, their own siblings, and children from the general population on tasks that required the working memory and inhibitory control abilities dependent on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The impairment was as evident in our oldest age range (31/2-7 years) as it was in the youngest (6-12 months). The higher a child's Phe level, the worse that child's performance. Girls were more adversely affected than boys. The deficit appears to be selective, affecting principally one neural system, since even PKU children with Phe levels three to five times normal performed well on the 13 control tasks. Clinical implications for the treatment of PKU and other neurodevelopmental disorders are discussed.

KW  - WELL-FOUNDED SEMANTICS
KW  - NEGATION
AB  - The present prolegomena consist, as all indeed do, in a critical discussion serving to introduce and interpret the extended works that follow in this book. As a result, the book is not a mere collection of excellent papers in their own specialty, but provides also the basics of the motivation, background history, important themes, bridges to other areas, and a common technical platform of the principal formalisms and approaches, augmented with examples.
   In the introduction we whet the reader's interest in the field of logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning with the promises it offers and with its outstanding problems too. There follows a brief historical background to logic programming, fr-om its inception to actuality, and its relationship to non-monotonic formalisms, stressing its semantical and procedural aspects.
   The next couple of sections provide motivating examples and an overview of the main semantics paradigms for normal programs (stable models and well-founded) and for extended logic programs (answer-sets, e-answer-sets, Nelson's strong negation, and well-founded semantics with pseudo and with explicit negation).
   A subequent section is devoted to disjunctive logic programs and its various semantical proposals.
   To conclude, a final section on implementation gives pointers to available systems and their sites.
   We leave out important concerns, such as paraconsistent semantics, contradiction removal, and updates. Hopefully they will be included in the next book in this series. But an extensive set of references allows the reader to delve into the specialized literature.
   For other recent relevant complementary overviews in this area we refer to [AP96,BDK97,BD96b,Min96,Dix95c].

AB  - The field of discourse processing has dissected many of the levels of representation that are constructed when individuals read or listen to connected discourse. These levels include the surface code, the propositional textbase, the referential situation model, the communication context, and the discourse genre. Discourse psychologists have developed models that specify how these levels are mentally represented and how they are dynamically built during comprehension. This chapter focuses on the meaning representations that are constructed when adults read written text, such as literary stories, technical expository text, and experimenter-generated ''textoids.'' Recent psychological models have attempted to account for the identification of referents of referring expressions (e.g. which person in the text does she refer to), the connection of explicit text segments, the establishment of local and global coherence, and the encoding of knowledge-based inferences.

AB  - Dementia in parkinsonism is caused by a variety of central nervous system (CNS) lesions, of which the molecular and pathogenic causes are poorly understood but probably include: 1. Degeneration of subcortical ascending systems with neuronal losses in dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic or multiple systems including the amygdyloid nucleus; 2. limbic and/or cortical Alzheimer and/or Lewy body pathologies, with loss of synapses and neurons, and 3. a combination of these lesions or additional CNS pathologies. In general, degeneration of subcortical neuronal networks appears insufficient to induce severe mental decline although, occasionally, cognitive impairment occurs without apparent cortical lesions. On the other hand, neuritic cortical Alzheimer change showing similar or differential distribution compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) displays a significant linear correlation with dementia in Parkinsonism. Plaques can be associated with cortical Lewy bodies and, the contribution of each to dementing processes remains unresolved. In a consecutive autopsy series of 610 patients with parkinsonism, the total prevalence of retrospectively assessed dementia was 34.6%. In Parkinson's disease (PD) of the Lewy body type, it was 30.2%, mostly associated with other brain lesions, mainly AD, while only 3.5% of "pure" PD without additional brain pathologies were demented. There was no significant difference in age and duration of illness between demented and non-demented PD patients. Secondary parkinsonian syndromes showed a higher incidence of dementia (56.3%), again with predominant Alzheimer pathology which was present in 73% of the total of demented parkinsonian patients and in almost 82% of the demented PD cases in this series. The specific contribution of cortical and subcortical lesions to mental impairment in parkinsonism, their relationship to AD, and an etiology await further elucidation.

AB  - Population-based, person-specific health surveys, with concomitant biological measures, should provide important information about the processes by which socioeconomic and psychosocial factors embed themselves in human health. Questionnaire responses allow for assessment of the perceived psychosocial environment, but biological measurements will measure the status of the psychoneuroimmunology/psychoneuroendocrinology (PNI/PNE) pathways and may allow us to identify people who have ''adapted'' to their stress because of experience, expectations, stoicism, etc. This review sets criteria to evaluate potential physiological markers of chronic stress. Because population health surveys involve a massive number of samples, special consideration must be given to the laboratory analysis method and transportation time of the markers chosen. We reviewed five areas: glycosylated proteins, the immune system, hemostasis, peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and the waist-hip ratio.

AB  - A new theoretical framework, executive-process interactive control (EPIC),is introduced for characterizing human performance of concurrent perceptual-motor and cognitive tasks. On the basis of EPIC, computational models may be formulated to simulate multiple-task performance under a variety of circumstances. These models account well for reaction-time data from representative situations such as the psychological refractory-period procedure. EPIC's goodness of fit supports several key conclusions: (a) At a cognitive level, people can apply distinct sets of production rules simultaneously for executing the procedures of multiple tasks; (b) people's capacity to process information at ''peripheral'' perceptual-motor levels is limited; (c) to cope with such Limits and to satisfy task priorities, flexible scheduling strategies are used; and (d) these strategies are mediated by executive cognitive processes that coordinate concurrent tasks adaptively.

AB  - The minireview summarizes data documenting that pyridoindole stobadine (STB) may protect nervous structures against oxidative stress. This was demonstrated by the impairment of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and sympathetic ganglia exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro as well as by survival of rats and dogs exposed to brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in vivo. The STB effect was linked mostly to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. STB seems to act primarily on phospholipids, thus protecting the integrity and function of somatic membranes in neurons as well as those in subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. STB prevented damage to Ca2+ sequestering systems in endoplasmic reticulum and synaptosomes induced by lipid peroxidation initiators. It was found to diminish changes in NMDA and adrenergic alpha(1)-receptors evoked in the brain by I/R or WR. The compound prevented total thiols, participating in tissue antioxidative protection, from decreasing in brain under these conditions. It readily penetrates into both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic compartments of the CNS. Data were obtained indicating that in I/R, protection of structures such as brain-blood vessels, endothelium, and/or erythrocytes may participate in the STB effect, besides the direct protection of nervous tissue. STB may be characterized as a potential protectant of the CNS in diseases in which oxidative injury may play an important role, for example, stroke, neurotrauma, chronic brain ischemia, or some neurodegenerative diseases. Its molecule could provide a useful model in the further search for novel compounds with even more pertinent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The last 30 years have seen a significant growth in health service evaluation literature in the field of mental health. Much of the best of this research has taken the form of random control trials of an experimental service against 'standard' or generic care. Interpretation of these results has been hampered by incomplete and inconsistent approaches to describing the experimental services, and often inadequate or completely non-existent characterization of the control service. In addition, the health care system in which the treatment programme is embedded is known to have important consequences for outcome. A proposal is advanced for a structured service description as a routine component for health services research reporting. Two worked examples are given, and a number of areas of ambiguity are highlighted.

AB  - It has been observed that epileptiform activity (EA) alters the sensitivity of neuronal tissue in a way that application of a convulsive principle for a second time induces a more pronounced activity; or a decrease of the threshold for the induction of this activity. This observation, however, is not generally valid. Several investigations have demonstrated a decrease of sensitivity as response to epileptiform preconditioning. Cerebral desensitization in response to EA was demonstrated by in-vivo as well as by in-vitro experiments. Partial blockade of a primary kindling focus by a secondary focus, reciprocal inhibition of different types of epilepsies, epilepsy-triggered feedback stimulation of the brain or the protective consequences of epilepsy experience have prompted the concept of an epilepsy related autoprotection which is the activation of anti-epileptic mechanisms by acute or former EA. It is likely that epileptogenic disturbances are present in each individual, but their expressions are overcome by compensatory mechanisms. Failure of these mechanisms, i.e. failure of epilepsy related autoprotection, may contribute to the development of epilepsy. The concept of autoprotection also postulates that the search for anti-epileptic therapies should include the analysis of intrinsic cerebral compensatory mechanisms.

AB  - It is shown that an alternative supersymmetric version of the Liouville equation extracted from D = 3 Green-Schwarz superstring equations naturally arises as a super-Toda model obtained from a properly constrained supersymmetric WZNW theory based on the sl(2,IR) algebra. Hamiltonian reduction is performed by imposing a non-linear superfield constraint which turns out to be a mixture of a first- and second-class constraint on supercurrent components. Supersymmetry of the model is realized non-linearly and is spontaneously broken. The set of independent current fields which survive the Hamiltonian reduction contains (in the holomorphic sector) one bosonic current of spin 2 (the stress tensor of the spin-0 Liouville mode) and two fermionic fields of spin 3/2 and -1/2. The n = 1 superconformal system thus obtained is of the same kind as one describing non-critical fermionic strings in a universal string theory. The generalization of this procedure allows one to produce from any bosonic Lie algebra super-Toda models and associated super-W algebras together with their non-standard realizations.

TI  - Psychotherapy integration: Its implications for psychiatry
KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Background. The proliferation of psychotherapies has been balanced by an equal and opposite tendency towards integration. Integrative approaches are particularly relevant to psychotherapy in psychiatric settings.
   Method. MEDLINE and manual literature searches yielded over 250 articles on psychotherapy integration, which are reviewed in the light of the authors' experience in a district psychotherapy service.
   Results. Psychotherapy integration is an umbrella term covering a wide range of meanings: rapprochement between different theoretical positions; convergence of ideas and techniques; eclectic selection from many different methods; and integration proper in specifically integrative therapies. Many effective psychotherapeutic treatments for psychiatric disorders are integrative, including those for depression, schizophrenia. bulimia nervosa and borderline personality disorder.
   Conclusions. Integration at the level of practice is common and desirable. At the level of theory, clarification and creative conflict are essential. Different therapeutic approaches should work closely together but retain their separate identities.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex subserves critical cognitive abilities even during early infancy and that improvement in these abilities is evident over roughly the next 10 years. We also know that (a) in adult monkeys these cognitive abilities depend critically on the dopaminergic projection to prefrontal cortex and (b) the distribution of dopamine axons within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex changes, and the level of dopamine increases, during the period that infant monkeys are improving on tasks that require the cognitive abilities dependent on prefrontal cortex. To begin to look at whether these cognitive abilities depend critically on the prefrontal dopamine projection in humans even during infancy and early childhood we have been studying children who we hypothesized might have a selective reduction in the dopaminergic innervation of prefrontal cortex and a selective impairment in the cognitive functions subserved by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These are children treated early and continuously for the genetic disorder, phenylketonuria (PKU). In PKU the ability to convert the amino acid, phenylalanine (Phe), into another amino acid, tyrosine (Tyr), is impaired. This causes Phe to accumulate in the bloodstream to dangerously high levels and the plasma level of Tyr to fall. Widespread brain damage and severe mental retardation result. When PKU is moderately well controlled by a diet low in Phe (thus keeping the imbalance between Phe and Tyr in plasma within moderate limits) severe mental retardation is averted, but deficits remain in higher cognitive functions. Tn a four-year longitudinal study we have found these deficits to be in the working memory and inhibitory control functions dependent upon dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in PKU children with plasma Phe levels 3-5 times normal. The fact that even infants showed these impairments suggests that dopaminergic innervation to prefrontal cortex is critical for the proper expression of these abilities even during the first year of life. To test the hypothesis about the underlying biological mechanism we have created the first animal model of early and continuously treated PKU. As predicted, the experimental animals had reduced levels of dopamine and the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), in prefrontal cortex and showed impaired performance on delayed alternation, a task dependent on prefrontal cortex function. Noradrenaline levels were unaffected; however some reduction in serotonin levels and in dopamine levels outside the prefrontal cortex was found.
   If prefrontal cortex functions are vulnerable in children with a moderate plasma Phe:Tyr imbalance because of the special properties of the dopamine neurons that project to prefrontal cortex, then other dopamine neurons that share those same properties should also be vulnerable in these children. The dopamine neurons in the retina share these properties (i.e. unusually high firing and dopamine turnover rates), and we have found that PKU children with plasma Phe levels 3-5 times normal are impaired in their contrast sensitivity, a behavioural measure sensitive to retinal dopamine levels.

AB  - The highest weight modules of the chiral algebra of orthogonal WZW models at level one possess a realization in fermionic representation spaces; the Kac-Moody and Virasoro generators are represented as unbounded limits of even CAR algebras. It is shown that the representation theory of the underlying even CAR algebras reproduces precisely the sectors of the chiral algebra. This fact allows to develop a theory of local von Neumann algebras on the punctured circle, fitting nicely in the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts framework. The relevant localized endomorphisms which generate the charged sectors are explicitly constructed by means of Bogoliubov transformations. Using CAR theory, the fusion rules in terms of sector equivalence classes are proven.

AB  - Background. This article aims to inform clinicians of current thinking in the area of victims and perpetrators of child sexual abuse. It covers prevalence data as well as identification, effects and interventions with victims, and also characteristics, assessment and treatment of perpetrators.
   Method. The review is based on manual searches and the authors' own clinical experience.
   Results. All clinicians should be aware of signs and symptoms that raise the possibility ?hat someone has been or is being sexually abused, and also of the possibilities of abuse of boys arid of women as abusers. Methods of intervening are discussed, both in relation to victims and perpetrators The importance of thoroughness when assessing perpetrators is emphasised because of their tendency to deny and/or minimise their offending. The demands of ?his work are underlined in a section on the necessary qualifications and characteristics of therapists working in this area.
   Conclusions. Despite the lack of agreement in definitions and outcome measures used in research there are some positive findings in relation to clinical efficacy In particular, the need for long-term treatment with those offenders who are more seriously deviant has been supported by recent research. There is a need for continuing attempts to standardise definitions and measures to aid realistic comparison of research results.

AB  - The phosphoinositide signal transduction system constitutes one of the primary means for intercellular communication in the central nervous system, but only recently has this system been studied in human brain. Although some investigations have studied phosphoinositide signaling in slices from biopsied human brain, due to the limited access to such material a greater number of studies have utilized membranes prepared from postmortem human brain. With membranes exposed to exogenous labeled phosphoinositides, activation of phospholipase C with calcium, with G-proteins stimulated by GTP gamma S or NaF, or with several receptor agonists, have demonstrated that all of the components of the phosphoinositide system are retained in human brain membranes and are responsive to appropriate stimuli. Investigators have begun to examine the effects of neurological (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease) and psychiatric (schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar affective disorder) diseases on the activity of the phosphoinositide system. Alzheimer's disease has been studied to the greatest extent and a severe deficit in phosphoinositide signaling has been identified in most studies. In addition, brain regionally selective deficits in G-protein function associated with phosphoinositide signaling have been reported in subjects with major depression or with bipolar affective disorder, and in the latter an ameliorative effect of the therapeutic drug lithium was identified. Although significant progress has been achieved in studying the phosphoinositide system in human brain, many issues remaining to be addressed are discussed in this review. With carefully controlled studies, it appears that much will be learned in the near future about the phosphoinositide signal transduction system in human brain and the effects of a variety of disorders on its function.

AB  - The best described function of the pineal hormone melatonin is to regulate seasonal reproduction, with its daily production and secretion varying throughout the seasons or the photoperiod. Additionally, a number of behavioral effects of the hormone have been found. This review describes the effects of melatonin in rodent behavior. We focus on: (a) inhibitory effects (sedation, hypnotic activity, pain perception threshold elevation, anti-convulsive activity, anti-anxiety effects); and (b) direct effects on circadian rhythmicity (entrainment, resynchronization, alleviation of jet-lag symptoms, phase-shifting). Most of these effects are clearly time-dependent, with a peak of melatonin activity during the night. One of the possible mechanisms of action for melatonin in the brain is the interaction with the GABAergic system, as suggested by neurochemical and behavioral data. Finally, some pineal hormone effects might be candidates as putative therapies for several human disorders. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Paradoxical sleep in rats, cats and mice is usually preceded and sometimes followed by a short-lasting (a few seconds) electroencephalogram (EEG) stage characterized by high-amplitude spindles in the anterior cortex and low-frequency theta rhythm in the dorsal hippocampus. The former is an index of advanced slow-wave sleep; the latter is an index of limbic activation since it occurs during active waking and paradoxical sleep. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines extend this intermediate stage at the expense of paradoxical sleep while concomitantly barbiturates suppress the pontine reticular activation characteristic of this sleep stage. During the intermediate stage, thalamocortical responsiveness and thalamic transmission level, which are controlled by brain stem activating influences, are the lowest of all sleep-waking stages. The unusual EEG pattern of this stage is otherwise only observed in the acute intercollicular-transected preparation. Therefore, forebrain structures may be functionally briefly disconnected from the brain-stem during this short-lasting stage, which could possibly account for the mental content of a similar sleep period in humans. In spite of strong evidence in favour of this forebrain deafferentiation hypothesis, other data indicate that the IS is in some way linked either to slow-wave sleep or to paradoxical sleep.

AB  - This article reviews models of the cerebellum and motor learning, from the landmark papers by Marr and Albus through those of the present time. The unique architecture of the cerebellar cortex is ideally suited for pattern recognition, but how is pattern recognition incorporated into motor control and learning systems? The present analysis begins with a discussion of exactly what the cerebellar cortex needs to regulate through its anatomically defined projections to premotor networks. Next, we examine various models showing how the microcircuitry in the cerebellar cortex could be used to achieve its regulatory functions. Having thus defined what it is that Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex must learn, we then evaluate theories of motor learning. We examine current models of synaptic plasticity, credit assignment, and the generation of training information, indicating how they could function cooperatively to guide the processes of motor learning.

AB  - Objective: This review critically examines conceptual and methodological issues of outcome research designed to evaluate the efficacy of marital therapy (MT). Behavioural marital therapy (BMT), cognitively orientated marital therapy (COMT), emotionally focused marital therapy (EFMT), and insight-oriented marital therapy (IOMT) have provided evidence for efficacy.
   Method: The initial literature search involved the use of the MEDLINE and Psychlit CD-ROM data bases. A secondary literature search based on citations in articles discovered in the initial search was also conducted Three broad categories involving the delineation of the client sample, study design considerations, and determination of treatment effects were addressed to investigate the qualify of evidence concerning the efficacy of MT.
   Results: None of the 4 approaches has proven superiority in efficacy, and the research does not provide evidence for the superiority of any one approach in distinct types of marital discord. There is some evidence to indicate that future outcome research should avoid the use of ''waiting list control groups.'' since their use appears to be neither ethical nor humane in marital discord research.
   Conclusions: The authors suggest that the concept of treatment efficiency may be more clinically relevant to outcome research. A gold standard for ''efficiency'' would suggest that a marital therapy approach should produce subjective and objective improvement in 50% of eligible couples, and this improvement should be maintained in half of these couples at the one-year follow-up assessment. This standard would be comparable to the data on the 4 effective approaches described in this review.

AB  - L-DOPA is proposed to be a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in CNS. It is released probably From neurons, which may contain L-DOPA as an end-product, and/or from some compartment other than catecholamine-containing vesicles. The L-DOPA itself produces presynaptic and postsynaptic responses. All are stereoselective and most are antagonized by competitive antagonist. In striatum, L-DOPA is neuromodulator, mother of catecholamines, not only a precursor for dopamine but also a potentiator of children for presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors to facilitate dopamine release and postsynaptic D-2 receptors, and ACh release inhibitor. All may cooperate for Parkinson's disease. Meanwhile, supersensitization of increase in L-glutamate release to nanomolar levodopa was seen in Parkinson's model rats, which may relate to dyskinesia or ''on-off'' during chronic therapy. In lower brainstem, L-DOPA tonically activates postsynaptic depressor sires of NTS and CVLM and presser sites of RVLM. L-DOPA is probably a neurotransmitter of primary baroreceptor afferents terminating in NTS. GABA, the inhibitory neuromodulator for baroreflex in NTS, tonically Functions to inhibit, via GABA(A) receptors, L-DOPA release and depressor responses to levodopa. Levodopa inversely releases GABA, L-DOPAergic monosynaptic relay from NTS to CVLM and From PHN to RVLM is suggested. Tonic L-DOPAergic baroreceptor-aortic nerve-NTS-CVLM relay seems to carry baroreflex information. Disturbance of neuronal activity to release L-DOPA in NTS, loss of the activity in CVLM, enhancement of the activity with decreased decarboxylation and increase in sensitivity to levodopa in RVLM may be involved in maintenance of hypertension in SHR. This is a story of ''L-DOPAergic receptors'' with extremely high affinity and low density. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comorbidity can increase the likelihood of treatment resistance and underscores the importance of thorough and definitive evaluation of all disorders. Treatment selections must be considered carefully to avoid significant side effects and drug-drug interactions. Metabolic pathways and effects on the identified organ system will guide the clinician's choice of antidepressant medication. Increasing numbers of alternatives and combinations will assist today's physician in treating depression in the medically ill patient effectively.

   Method A systematic literature review was undertaken, using Medline and Psych Info and supplemented by correspondence with relevant institutions and authorities in the field. The review identifies potential specific outcome measurement tools. These tools are evaluated using the scientific criteria of validity and reliability, responsiveness to change, and appropriateness of each tool's format for use in routine clinical practice.
   Results Three broad categories of outcome are identified: population outcomes, specific outcome and performance indicators. Nineteen specific outcome measurement tools are short-listed and compared in detail. No single tool is suitable for use as a comprehensive outcome measurement tool in routine clinical practice.
   Conclusions A combination of some of the tools short-listed will cover all the necessary outcome items. However, the increase in assessment time will reduce clinical usefulness. Further research is needed to modify or create appropriate outcome measurement tools for use in routine clinical practice.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) is probably the most widely studied form of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system. In the early descriptions, the term referred to a sustained increase in synaptic response following a brief high-frequency electrical tetanus. Apparently unique properties of the phenomenon triggered considerable excitement in the field: for many, LTP offered the promise of a potential substrate for learning and/or memory. In the more than 20 years since LTP was first discovered, investigators motivated by this promise have described a vast array of molecules and processes that may be involved in LTP induction and maintenance. And yet, the mechanisms by which LTP occurs have not been resolved. Instead, the compiled results have uncovered layer upon layer of intricacy, including multiple LTP forms and multiple molecular cascades involved in LTP expression. The generally stated thesis that LTP equates to learning and/or memory at a synaptic level has not faced a serious challenge despite the fact that workers in the field have not provided an unambiguous correlation of LTP with either. A number of investigators have now shifted their attention to a newer form of synaptic modification, long-term depression (LTD). Whatever studies of LTD reveal, it is clear that the fundamental questions about LTP remain unanswered: what is it really and what, if anything, is it used for? In this review, we summarize the data concerning putative LTP mechanisms and the evidence for LTP's role in learning and memory. we show that extant models are not sufficient to account for the various forms of LTP and that the experimental evidence does not justify the view that LTP equates to learning and memory. Instead, we suggest that LTP can be related to other forms of synaptic modification, e.g., LTD and kindling, in a neuroplasticity/pathology continuum of events. In particular, we suggest that neurotransmitter receptor regulation may be a key element leading to synaptic modification: in the adult nervous system, homeostatic receptor regulation normally compensates for alterations in synaptic input, while in the developing nervous system a form of 'homeodynamic' receptor regulation prevails. Our model proposes that homeodynamic receptor regulation leading to an LTP-like effect triggers, or acts in concert with, synaptogenesis to allow young neurons to modify response characteristics in response to altered input. In contrast, some forms of LTP in adult neurons may represent a 'failed' form of receptor regulation whose final outcome is neural death. The model suggests a series of experimentally verifiable hypotheses.

AB  - This review was undertaken to assess the indications for and efficacy of maintenance treatments for major depression. It was based on a search of the medical literature and a review of randomized clinical trials. The literature shows that antidepressant medications and, to a lesser extent, psychotherapy are both effective in preventing recurrence of major depression. Lithium and carbamazepine may also be effective. Antidepressant medications are probably more effective at full therapeutic doses than at the lower doses initially advised for maintenance treatment. Based on this review, maintenance treatment should be considered for any patient with recurrent major depression. It is clearly indicated in individuals with multiple frequent episodes. Patients with less-severe illness must weigh the risks and benefits of treatment in light of their earlier course and symptoms, the current impact of treatment, and the likely future impact of additional episodes.

AB  - This article identifies new research and policy directions for the field of worksite health in the context of the changing American workplace. These directions are viewed from an ecological perspective on worksite health and are organized around three major themes: (1) the joint influence of physical and social environmental factors on occupational health, (2) the effects of nonoccupational settings (e,g., households, the health care system) on employee well-being and the implications of recent changes in these settings for worksite health programs, and (3) methodological issues in the design and evaluation of worksite health programs, Developments in these areas suggest that the field of worksite health may be undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift away from individually oriented wellness programs (provided at the worksite and aimed primarily at changing employees' health behavior) and toward broader formulations emphasizing the joint impact of the physical and social environment at work job-person fit, and work policies on employee well-being.

AB  - Genetic factors have long been implicated in the aetiology of bipolar disorder (ED). During the past two decades several linkage studies have been carried out with the aim of identifying major genes. However, remarkable discrepancies in results both between and within studies have constituted a major problem. In order to elucidate some of these conflicts, we assessed the published literature on linkage studies of bipolar disorder, focusing on methodological issues. Studies published between January 1980 and December 1994 were identified by computerized literature searches and subsequent scanning of review articles, and the reference lists of the articles primarily identified. A set of defined inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to select studies for assessment. A total of 31 variables were determined, and pre-defined codes were assigned in a structured manner. More than 200 citations were reviewed, and 60 articles were included in this study. Descriptive statistical analyses of the variables, as well as associations between variables, are presented. The findings are discussed with regard to the possibility that, beyond the genetic complexity of the disorder itself, there are several other similarly complicated study design issues which should be more carefully observed. Moreover, the need for standardization of basic criteria to use and report clinical and analytical parameters employed in linkage studies is strongly suggested.

AB  - Objective: To review the published literature in relation to prevalence of HIV infection and risk behaviours for HIV among the mentally ill to assist in the development of appropriate strategies for public health policy, surveillance and clinical management of HIV and HIV risk in these groups.
   Method: A search of published literature was carried out using 'Medline', in association with following up appropriate papers cited in the references of journals identified.
   Results: The North American literature shows an increased risk of HIV infection in psychiatric patients receiving treatment in both inpatient or community settings. HIV infection is associated with a number of risk behaviours, particularly male homosexual sex and injecting drug use, and being the sexual partner of a person with a history of these. Impulsivity, high levels of sexual activity during acute exacerbations of psychiatric illness, poor skills at negotiating safe sex, homelessness and drug abuse are all risk behaviours common among those affected by some mental illnesses. The mentally ill also have a comparatively poorer knowledge of HIV/AIDS. There is a dearth of published Australian data addressing the question of HIV seroprevalence or risk in the mentally ill. Although there has been development and implementation of HIV risk-reduction programs overseas, the development and evaluation of any programs in Australia has not been published.
   Conclusions: Arguably, Australia has developed a comprehensive program of national surveillance for HIV infection and has been relatively successful in its response to the HIV epidemic, with the high rates of infection in the early to mid-1980s substantially reduced to around 600 new diagnoses per year. However, while risk behaviours which exposed those infected with the virus are recorded, underlying conditions which predispose them to these behaviours are not. Nevertheless, there is HIV infection amongst mentally ill and intellectually disabled people in Australia. Examination of the North American experience reveals opportunities to prevent a high rate of HIV infection in those with mental illness in Australia, Such a program would require adequate risk behaviour assessment, appropriate diagnostic testing and management, and development of specific educational interventions which are properly evaluated to ensure their effectiveness.

AB  - We clarify the role played by BPS states in the calculation of threshold corrections of D = 4, N = 2 heterotic string compactifications. We evaluate these corrections for some classes of compactifications and show that they are sums of logarithmic functions over the positive roots of generalized Kac-Moody algebras. Moreover, a certain limit of the formulae suggests a reformulation of heterotic string in terms of a gauge theory based on hyperbolic algebras such as E(10). We define a generalized Kac-Moody Lie superalgebra associated to the BPS states. Finally we discuss the relation of our results with string duality.

AB  - Background. Emotional disorder associated with physical illness falls into two main groups: Psychological reaction to physical illness 'and' somatic presentation of psychological disorder: Psychological treatments are becoming more widespread in the general hospital setting, but there are few systematic evaluations.
   Method. A manual and computer (MEDLINE) literature search was performed. Studies which provided insight into clinical practice were selected for discussion, and randomised controlled trials of at least 6 weeks duration and inclusion of 30 or more subjects were selected for review. Results. Fourteen empirical studies were found: six involving patients with chronic organic disorder and eight involving patients with somatisation.
   Conclusions. There is little empirical evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions are of benefit when applied indiscriminately to patients with organic disease. Further work is required to delineate subgroups of patients who may be responsive. There is mounting evidence that psychotherapy is beneficial in patients with somatisation disorders. Patients with very chronic symptoms may require intensive treatment approaches.

AB  - The most important genetic advances in the field of mental retardation include the discovery of the novel genetic mechanism responsible for the Fragile X syndrome, and the imprinting involved in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, but there have also been advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Down syndrome and phenylketonuria. Genetic defects (both single gene Mendelizing disorders and cytogenetic abnormalities) are involved in a substantial proportion of cases of mild as well as severe mental retardation, indicating that the previous equating of severe mental retardation with pathology, and of mild retardation with normal variation, is a misleading oversimplication. Within the group in which no pathological cause can be detected, behaviour genetic studies indicate that genetic influences are important, but that their interplay with environmental factors, which are also important, is at present poorly understood. Research into the joint action of genetic and environmental influences in this group will be an important research area in the future.

AB  - Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuronal metabolic dysfunction appear to be central to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The substantia nigra pars compacta-the area where the primary pathological lesion is located-is particularly exposed to oxidative stress and toxic and metabolic insults. A reduced capacity to cope with metabolic demands, possibly related to impaired mitochondrial function, may render nigral neurons highly vulnerable to the effects of glutamate, which acts as a neurotoxin in the presence of impaired cellular energy metabolism. In this way, glutamate may participate in the pathogenesis of PD. Degeneration of dopamine nigral neurons is followed by striatal dopaminergic denervation, which causes a cascade of functional modifications in the activity of basal ganglia nuclei. As an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate plays a pivotal role in normal basal ganglia circuitry. With nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion, the glutamatergic projections from subthalamic nucleus to the basal ganglia output nuclei become overactive and there are regulatory changes in glutamate receptors in these regions. There is also evidence of increased glutamatergic activity in the striatum. In animal models, blockade of glutamate receptors ameliorates the motor manifestations of PD. Therefore, it appears that abnormal patterns of glutamatergic neurotransmission are important in the symptoms of PD. The involvement of the glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis and symptomatology of PD provides potential new targets for therapeutic intervention in this neurodegenerative disorder.

AB  - Corticostriatal transmission has an important function in the regulation of the neuronal activity of the basal ganglia. The firing activity of corticostriatal neurones excites striatal cells via the release of glutamate. Presynaptic receptors that ave located on corticostriatal terminals and that regulate the release of glutamate in the striatum have been postulated for dopamine and glutamate. Activation of these receptors may exert a negative feed-back on the striatal release of glutamate. High-frequency activation of corticostriatal fibres causes either long-term depression or long-term potentiation of excitatory transmission depending on the subclass of glutamate receptor that is activated. These forms of synaptic plasticity could be involved in motor learning. Alterations in striatal synaptic plasticity might be implicated in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.

AB  - Parkinson's disease, known also as striatal dopamine deficiency syndrome, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by akinesia, muscular rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural abnormalities. In early stages of parkinsonism, there appears to be a compensatory increase in the number of dopamine receptors to accommodate the initial loss of dopamine neurons. As the disease progresses, the number of dopamine receptors decreases, apparently due to the concomitant degeneration of dopamine target sites on striatal neurons. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease results in enhanced metabolism of dopamine, augmenting the formation of H2O3, thus leading to generation of highly neurotoxic hydroxyl radicals (OH .). The generation of free radicals can also be produced by 6-hydroxydopamine or MPTP which destroys striatal dopaminergic neurons causing parkinsonism in experimental animals as well as human beings.
   Studies of the substantia nigra after death in Parkinson's disease have suggested the presence of oxidative stress and depletion of reduced glutathione; a high level of total iron with reduced level of ferritin; and deficiency of mitochondrial complex I.
   New approaches designed to attenuate the effects of oxidative stress and to provide neuroprotection of striatal dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease include blocking dopamine transporter by mazindol, blocking NMDA receptors by dizocilpine maleate, enhancing the survival of neurons by giving brain-derived neurotrophic factors, providing antioxidants such as vitamin E, or inhibiting monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) by selegiline. Among all of these experimental therapeutic refinements, the use of selegiline has been most successful in that it has been shown that selegiline may have a neurotrophic factor-like action rescuing striatal neurons and prolonging the survival of patients with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Compared to the general population, one consistent finding in schizophrenia research is a significant surplus of schizophrenic births in the winter/spring months. There is little evidence that this is attributed to statistical artefacts. The 'harmful effects' hypothesis offers the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon. Exogenous harmful effects, predominant during the cold season, may affect the developing immature fetal brain and thus constitute some of the factors predisposing to schizophrenic breakdown in adulthood. Neuropathological and epidemiological studies point to the second trime-non of gestation as the crucial period of fetal brain maturation. Recently, some studies found that the surplus in schizophrenic winter/spring births is mainly due to sporadic forms. In contrast, patients with high genetic risk of the disease even tended to have a birth deficit during this period. This suggests that schizophrenia is not a disease entity but consists of etiologically distinct subgroups on which the influence of genes and/or environment has to be weighted differently On the one hand, in sporadic forms of the disease exogenous noxious agents may be of major etiological importance. On the other hand, in fetuses at high genetic risk neurodevelopment may already be disturbed due to a genetic defect and additional environmentally noxious agents can cause abortions, stillbirths and sudden infant deaths.

AB  - Objective: To explore physiological effects of a water supply containing 0 to 2441 parts per billion trichloroethylene (TCE).
   Design and Patient Selection: A questionnaire was mailed to 103 residents of a western Illinois community on the Rock River. All responded and were selected for study along with 15 additional residents; 12 were dropped leaving 106. All were involved in a legal action against the nearby industrial plant that reportedly ejected TCE into the river contaminating the wells that supplied the community's water. Outpatient clinic for chronic pain.
   Setting: Outpatient clinic for chronic pain.
   Main outcome measures: Physical, neurological, psychological, and subjective data.
   Results: The most common complaint was headache; 51 of 103 subjects surveyed mentioned severe or frequent headaches. Two years later, 66 of the 106 subjects complained of headaches. After excluding those diagnosed using known criteria, 57 patients remained who had headaches that might be ascribed to TCE exposure. Of these, 47 had a family history of headaches.
   Conclusion: Their common exposure to TCE, a genetic disposition, a learned response to stress, or a combination of factors may account for the headaches, which were bifrontal, throbbing, gradual more often than sudden in onset, without sex predominance, and without associated features. TCE may cause headache at lower levels of exposure than previously reported.

AB  - As the scientific study of the individual person, personality psychology historically has struggled to provide the kind of broad conceptual framework capable of orienting theory and research around human individuality in cultural context. This article presents a new integrative framework for studying persons that brings together recent advances in the field of personality with the emerging social science emphasis on the narrative study of lives, while situating personality inquiry within the cultural context of contemporary modernity and the unique problems of the modem self The framework builds on a clear distinction between the ''I'' and the ''Me'' features of personality in the modem world and the delineation of three relatively independent levels on which modern persons may be described. In personality, the I may be viewed as the process of ''selfing,'' of narrating experience to create a modern self whereas the Me may be viewed as the self that the I constructs. Personality traits, like those included within the Big Five taxonomy, reside at Level I of personality description and provide a general, comparative, and nonconditional dispositional signature for the person. Level II subsumes tasks, goals, projects, tactics, defenses, values, and other developmental, motivational, and/or strategic concerns that contextualize a person's life in time, place, and role. Speaking directly to the modern problem of reflexively creating a unified and purposeful configuration of the Me, life stories reside at the third level of personality, as internalized integrative narrations of the personal past, present, and future. It is mainly through the psychosocial construction of life stories that modern adults create identity in the Me. Life stories may be examined in terms of their structure and content, function, development, individual differences, and relation to mental health and psychosocial adaptation.

AB  - Although it is well-established that there are age deficits on measures of explicit memory, there is conflicting evidence as to whether implicit memory, as measured by performance on various repetition priming tasks, is impaired by age. In order to clarify the relation between aging and implicit memory, priming tasks were organized in the following categories: (a) perceptual-item priming, (b) perceptual-associative priming, (c) conceptual-item priming, (d) conceptual-associative priming, and (e) perceptual-motor priming. The taxonomy took into account the type of mental representation that different priming tasks depend on, the neurological structures responsible for these representations, the extent to which printing tasks demand the formation of novel associations, and the various blends of data-driven and conceptually driven processes that facilitate task performance. A literature review based on this taxonomy revealed two tentative conclusions. First, the processes associated with normal aging are likely to impair performance on tasks of conceptual-item priming and conceptual-associative priming, but do not have a negative affect on tasks of perceptual-item priming, perceptual-associative priming, and perceptual-motor priming. Second, this pattern of selective preservation and impairment is also displayed by patients with Alzheimer's disease but not amnesia or Huntington's disease. These findings were interpreted from the perspective of a model of human memory that builds on recent advances within the domain of cognitive neuropsychology.

We present pedagogic examples of models which realize SO(10) as a level two current algebra on the world-sheet, and discuss in general how higher level current algebras can be realized in the tensor product of simple constituent conformal field theories, We describe formal developments necessary to compute couplings in models built using real fermionization. This allows us to isolate cases of spin structures where the standard prescription for real fermionization may break down.

AB  - In focal ischaemia, the penumbra defines regions with blood flow below that needed to sustain electrical activity, but above that required to maintain cellular ionic gradients, and that lead in time to infarction. Among other terms used to describe regions surrounding the ischaemic core, ''penumbra'' is the only one based on a precise functional state of partially ischaemic tissue. The precarious balance between energy supply and demand that characterizes the penumbra and the proximity of the ischaemic core are the basis of a number of important features: (a) It is a time-limited condition, with a tendency to evolve towards infarction and to propagate to adjacent viable tissue; (b) ''misery perfusion'' is associated with increased oxygen extraction, acidosis, and high glucose utilization, but residual ATP; (c) recurrent spreading depression contributes to the deterioration of the penumbra, at least in animal models of stroke; (d) there is no sustained increase of extracellular glutamate; and (e) improvement of local perfusion and reduction of energy demand remain the most rational approaches to rescue the penumbra By defining a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention in stroke, the concept of ischaemic penumbra has enormously stimulated research in this field and led to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischaemia, with direct practical application for the surgical management of cerebrovascular disorders such as aneurysms.

AB  - Background. Psychosocial factors may contribute 25-30% to the outcome variance in bipolar disorders. Sufferers have identified benefits from psychotherapy, but biological models and treatments dominate the research agenda. The author reviews research on psychosocial issues and interventions in this disorder.
   Method. Research on adjustment to the disorder, interpersonal stressors and obstacles to treatment compliance were located by computerised searches and the author's knowledge of the literature. All published outcome studies of psychosocial interventions in bipolar disorder are reviewed.
   Results. There is an inadequate database on psychosocial factors associated with onset and maintenance of bipolar disorder. While the outcome studies available are methodologically inadequate, the accumulated evidence suggests that psychosocial interventions may have significant benefits for bipolar sufferers and their families.
   Conclusions. Given the significant associated morbidity and mortality, there is a clear need for more systematic clinical management that addresses psychosocial as well as biological aspects of bipolar disorder. The author identifies appropriate research strategies to improve knowledge of effective psychosocial interventions.

Interest has grown in the use of SSRIs as alternatives to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and in the therapeutic use of combinations of SSRIs and TCAs in refractory depression.
   Method. MEDLINE and PSYCLit literature searches were conducted. Reference sections from papers retrieved were scrutinised for other relevant reports.
   Results. Of 41 relevant articles identified, 35 were selected for review.
   Conclusions. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline may substantially increase TCA plasma levels when given concurrently. Such interactions may give rise to adverse effects. The effect of sertraline may be less profound than that of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Limited data suggest that citalopram may not affect TCA serum levels. There is scant literature evidence to support the use of SSRIs in combination with TCAs as a treatment for refractory depression.

This article provides a critical evaluation of theses studies, with implications for future research. Concerns over earlier linkage trials make this scrutiny current and topical.

AB  - Background. There is considerable inconsistency in the results of studies of the psychological and sexual sequelae of the menopause and their treatment.
   Method. A search of the literature on Medline was made of studies of psychological symptoms in women who were either naturally or surgically menopausal or who were receiving hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms.
   Results. There is evidence of a small increase in psychological morbidity (not usually amounting to psychiatric disorder) preceding the natural menopause and following the surgical menopause. Psychosocial as well as hormonal factors are relevant. While the response of psychosocial symptoms to hormone replacement therapy with oestrogens is Variable and most marked in the surgical menopause, in some studies the effect is little greater than that for placebo. Where sexual symptoms are present, there is more consistent evidence that hormone replacement therapy is effective.
   Conclusions. In the light of the available evidence, the current use of hormone replacement therapy to treat psychological symptoms detected at the time of (but not necessarily therefore due to) the natural menopause must be questioned. It does appear that oestrogen therapy ameliorates psychological symptoms after surgical menopause.

AB  - Almost all human populations exhibit seasonal variation in births, owing mostly to seasonal variation in the frequency of conception. This review focuses on the degree to which environmental factors like nutrition, temperature and photoperiod contribute to these seasonal patterns by acting directly on the reproductive axis.
   The reproductive strategy of humans is basically that of the apes: Humans have the capacity to reproduce continuously, albeit slowly, unless inhibited by environmental influences. Two, and perhaps three, environmental factors probably act routinely as seasonal inhibitors in some human populations.
   First, it seems likely that ovulation is regulated seasonally in populations experiencing seasonal variation in food availability. More specifically, it seems likely that inadequate food intake or the increased energy expenditure required to obtain food, or both, can delay menarche, suppress the frequency of ovulation in the nonlactating adult, and prolong lactational amenorrhea in these populations on a seasonal basis. This action is mast easily seen in tropical subsistence societies where food availability often varies greatly owing to seasonal variation in rainfall; hence births in these populations often correlate with rainfall.
   Second, it seems likely that seasonally high temperatures suppress spermatogenesis enough to influence the incidence of fertilization in hotter latitudes, but possibly only in males wearing clothing that diminishes scrotal cooling. Since most of our knowledge about this phenomenon comes from temperate latitudes, the sensitivity of spermatogenesis in both human and nonhuman primates to heat in the tropics needs further study. It is quite possible that high temperatures suppress ovulation and early embryo survival seasonally in some of these same populations. Since we know less than desired about the effect of heat stress on ovulation and early pregnancy in nonhuman mammals, and nothing at all about it in humans or any of the other primates, this is an important area for future research.
   Third, correlational data suggest that there may be some degree of regulation of reproduction by photoperiod in humans at middle to higher latitudes. Populations at these latitudes often show a peak in presumed conceptions associated with the vernal equinox. On the other hand, evidence gathered by neuroendocrinologists tends to argue against reproductive photoresponsiveness in humans.

   Method. International literature searches using MEDLINE and Psych-Info, books and relevant book chapters were examined.
   Results. One hundred and twenty-five articles were selected for analysis; 30 of the most relevant are discussed.
   Conclusions. Discrete approaches to treatment have been developed, but many have yet to be evaluated critically. Common therapeutic elements are outlined. It is recommended that an integrated, flexible, client-centred approach utilising several techniques is most likely to achieve best results. Wider socio-political aspects should be taken into account, and treatment must be consistent with cultural expectations. Future directions for research are outlined and the role of primary prevention is stressed.

   Results: The literature is discussed and a tentative checklist of risk factors for non-compliance is offered, as is advice on ways in which the problem may be minimised, It is noted that there is an emphasis on major mental disorders in the published literature.
   Conclusion: There is no stereotypical defaulter. A high index of suspicion is essential. As far as possible, the patient should be educated to share in the responsibility for treatment, and concerned relatives and others can often play a pivotal role. More research is required on compliance problems in the minor psychiatric disorders, Close liaison with the general practitioner is vital.

AB  - A theory of voluntary, top-down control of visual spatial attention is presented that explains how linguistic cues like ''above,'' ''below,'' ''left,'' and ''right'' are used to direct attention from one object to another.  The theory distinguishes between perceptual and conceptual representations of space and views attention as a set of mechanisms that establish correspondences between the representations.  Spatial reference frames play an important part in this analysis.  The theory interprets reference frames as mechanisms of attention, similar to spatial indices but with more computational power.  The theory was tested in 11 experiments that assessed the importance of linguistic distinctions between classes of spatial relations (basic, deictic, and intrinsic) and examined the flexibility with which subjects manipulated spatial reference frames.

AB  - The existing evidence paints an unclear picture of whether an association exists between depression and memory impairment. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether depression is associated with memory impairment, whether moderator variables determine the extent of this association, and whether any obtained association is unique to depression. Meta-analytic techniques were used to synthesize data from 99 studies on recall and 48 studies on recognition in clinically depressed and nondepressed samples. Associations between memory impairment and other psychiatric disorders( e.g., schizophrenia, dementia) were also examined. A significant, stable association between depression and memory impairment was revealed. Further analyses indicated, however, that it is likely that depression is linked to particular aspects of memory, the linkage is found in particular subsets of depressed individuals, and memory impairment is not unique to depression.

The literature on PSP has been neurologically oriented whereas the psychiatric aspects have been relatively neglected. A review of the literature shows that psychiatric disturbance in PSP is common but with no characteristic pattern. Cognitive impairment, nonspecific affective and behavioral disturbances are commonly found, whereas frank psychosis or bipolar disorder are rare. Misdiagnoses with psychiatric disorders are common and a heightened awareness of the condition is necessary for early diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: Irish psychiatrists may begin to spend, as their British have counterparts have, at least some of their time delivering a psychiatric service from primary care settings. It was therefore decided to review the origins and development of attitudes towards and outcome of this practice in Britain.
   Method: A literature search and review of relevant papers was undertaken.
   Results: Collaboration between psychiatrists and general practitioners began to expand significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. Three main models are used, the shifted outpatient model, the selected consultation model and the liaison-attachment team model. The shifted out-patient model is liked by patients whose attendance rate is better at such clinics and in some areas this model has resulted in a fall in hospital admission rates. There is a paucity of papers examining outcome of the other models. Results of the one extensively studied team liaison approach reports higher treated prevalence rates and lower admission rates for those patients referred. There was no effect on detection of illness by GPs and the service was much more costly.
   Conclusions: While some benefits may result from use of the shifted out-patient approach, they are not compelling enough to enable a firm recommendation for its widespread implementation to be made. The results to date suggest the team-liaison approach does not produce benefits sufficient to outweigh the increased cost. The selected consultation model may hold greater potential but needs to be more extensively researched. Finally the structure of general practice in Ireland, with so few GPs working in multiple partner practices makes it highly unlikely that the widespread introduction of collaboration will be feasible.

AB  - In recent years, the magnitude, consistency, and stability across time of cognitive sex differences have been questioned. The present study examined these issues in the context of spatial abilities. A metaanalysis of 286 effect sizes from a variety of spatial ability measures was conducted. Effect sizes were partitioned by the specific test used and by a number of variables related to the experimental procedure in order to achieve homogeneity. Results showed that sex differences are significant in several tests but that some interest differences exist. Partial support was found for the notion that the magnitude of sex differences has decreased in recent years. Finally, it was found that the age of emergence of sex differences depends on the test used. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for the study of sex differences in spatial abilities.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease are major human neurodegenerative disorders, the etiologies for which remain unknown. Although a unique subset of neurons is particularly affected in each of the three diseases, they have several intriguing overlapping similarities. Evidence is reviewed supporting the hypothesis that these diseases result from an inability to protect against accumulated damage by free radicals due to oxidative stress. If oxidative stress underlies or exacerbates the etiology of these diseases, then agents that effectively attenuate brain tissue lipid peroxidation or otherwise limit free radical damage may hold promise for the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases. Although antioxidant chemical supplementation may provide effective therapy, the most effective therapy for neurodegenerative diseases may be treatment with specific neurotrophic, survival-promoting proteins, For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotes survival of spinal motor neurons and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. One mechanism through which these proteins may exert their protection may be by stimulating endogenous defenses against oxidative stress and damage by free radicals. This hypothesis is being tested in several laboratories and provides exciting direction both for basic neurobiological research and therapeutic drug discovery.

TI  - DYSTHYMIA IN CLINICAL-PRACTICE
AB  - Background. Dysthymia has been reconceptualised in recent years from a personality disorder to a chronic affective disorder. It is incorporated into both the DSM and ICD diagnostic systems.
   Method. The members of the WPA Dysthymia Working Group combined the results of their manual literature searches with a search using Medline.
   Results. Available data are summarised under the headings of classification, epidemiology, validity, comorbidity, course and outcome, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The coexistence of major depressive disorder, constituting 'double depression' is of particular importance.
   Conclusions. Improved knowledge of this disorder has led to a more positive approach to treatment, in which antidepressants can usefully be complemented by psychosocial measures. A high proportion of cases remain unrecognised in most populations, leading to prolonged morbidity and distress, much of which is now treatable.

AB  - Background. Decision analysis is an explicit, quantitative approach to examining difficult decisions about course of action. Its applicability to psychiatry is considered.
   Method. An example of how decision analysis could be used in psychiatry is given, criticism of the technique is discussed, and previous attempts to apply it to mental illness problems (from a Medline search from 1966 onwards) are reviewed.
   Conclusion. The future for decision analysis in psychiatry lies in teaching, audit and research, rather than clinical work.

AB  - Air pollution can have direct effects on trees. It can cause visible injury to foliage and a disruption of physiological processes, such as photosynthesis and carbon allocation, leading to losses in growth and productivity. This review suggests that of equal or greater importance is the potential of air pollutants to indirectly affect tree growth and vitality by predisposing them to injury from other abiotic and biotic stresses. Predisposition by air pollutants can be the result of a disruption in biochemical processes, such as enzyme activity or production, or physiological factors (e.g. stomatal closure, carbon allocation). Air pollutants such as SO2, O3 and acidic mists have been implicated as predisposing agents to two of the most important of these stresses: low temperature and soil moisture. Probable mechanisms, as well as implications of predicted changes in global climate will be discussed.

AB  - In the past 5 years, considerable interest has been expressed in the possible involvement of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor mechanisms in anxiety disorders. Stemming from early clinical observations in the 1960s and electrophysiological findings some twenty years later, this interest now encompasses research on the behavioral effects of CCK receptor agonists and antagonists at both clinical and preclinical levels. The results to date have been encouraging enough to prompt a number of pharmaceutical companies to ''fast track'' the development of CCK receptor antagonists as antipanic agents. The present review critically assesses research findings in this area and concludes that the field is rife with inconsistency, the data are subject to a variety of methodological and interpretative pitfalls, and, unfortunately, the promise of therapeutic advance through CCK receptor antagonists may be illusory.

AB  - A 39 year-old severely disabled woman with a 19 year history of chronic relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) began to experience improvement in symptoms within 24 hours after she received experimental treatment with picotesla electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Pattern reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) study obtained three weeks after the initiation of the first magnetic treatment showed a return to normal of the P-100 latencies in each eye. The patient continued to receive 1-2 EMFs treatments per week and during the following 32 months she made a dramatic recovery with resolution of diplopia, blurring of vision, dysarthria, ataxia of gait, and bladder dysfunction as well as-improvement in fatigue, heat tolerance, mood, sleep, libido, and cognitive functions. VEP studies, which were repeated in April of 1995 more than 2 1/2 years after the initiation of magnetic treatment, showed that P-100 latencies remained normal in each eye providing objective documentation that continued application of these EMFs may sustain normal conduction in the damaged optic pathways over a long period of time. This is the first case report documenting the dramatic long term beneficial effects of treatment with picotesla range EMFs in a patient with MS.

AB  - A 54 year-old woman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1985 at the age of 45 after she developed diplopia, slurred speech, and weakness in the right leg. A Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) scan obtained in 1985 showed several areas of plaque formation distributed in the periventricular white matter and centrum semi-ovale bilaterally. Coincident with slow deterioration in her condition since 1990 a second MRI scan was obtained in 1991 which showed a considerable increase in the number and size of plaques throughout both cerebral hemispheres, subcortical white matter, periventricularly and brainstem. In 1994, the patient received treatment with Interferon beta-lb (Betaseron(R)) for 6 months with no improvement in symptoms. However, following two successive extracranial applications of pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range each of 20 minutes duration the patient experienced an immediate improvement in symptoms most dramatically in gait, balance, speech, level of energy, swallowing, mood, and vision. On a maintenance program of 3 treatments per month the patient's only symptom is mild right foot and leg weakness. The report points to the unique efficacy of externally applied pT range EMFs in the symptomatic treatment of MS, indicates a lack of an association between the extent of demyelinating plaques on MRI scan and rate and extent of recovery in response to EMFs, and supports the notion that dysfunction of synaptic conductivity due to neurotransmitter deficiency particularly of serotonin (5-HT) contributes more significantly to the development of MS symptoms than the process of demyelination which clinically seems to represent an epiphenomenon of the disease.

AB  - Objective - To review a series of conceptual and methodological problems encountered in surveys primarily devoted to pain disorders.
   Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles - Published reports were systematically collected by electronic database searches (Medline), citations in existing publications, and through personal contacts. Relevant articles from clinical and epidemiological research on pain were included and special attention was given to epidemiological research on back pain.
   Conclusions - Surveys of pain disorders should be based on a multidimensional pain model that includes nociceptive input, pain perception, suffering, and pain behaviour as major components. Because of the limited applicability of diagnostic procedures or genuine ''non-specificity'' of pain states, or both, epidemiological surveys may result in a considerable proportion of cases without an identifiable pathophysiological basis. Staging and grading procedures for pain disorders (as distinguished from classification) may comprise various aspects of pain perception: regional distribution, pain intensity, temporal characteristics, sensory qualities, and dimensions of cognitive-emotional appraisal. Description of temporal development and chronification (staging) should refer to different components of the multidimensional pain model. Explicit a posteriori procedures for grading are preferable to implicit grading based on question wording. Evidence from several sources suggests that localistic concepts of pain may be misleading. Identification of complex pain syndromes should be one primary target for epidemiological pain surveys. Of the many factors that may impair the reliability and validity of data collected in pain surveys, recall biases seem to deserve special attention.

AB  - Objective: Lyme disease is a multisystemic illness that can affect the central nervous system (CNS), causing neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. The goal of this article is to familiarize psychiatrists with this spirochetal illness. Method: Relevant books, articles, and abstracts from academic conferences were perused, and additional articles were located through computerized searches and reference sections from Published articles. Results: Up to 40% of patients with Lyme disease develop neurologic involvement of either the peripheral or central nervous system. Dissemination to the CNS can occur within the first few weeks after skin infection. Like syphilis, Lyme disease may have a latency period of months to years before symptoms of late infection emerge. Early signs include meningitis, encephalitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuropathies. Later, encephalomyelitis and encephalopathy may occur. A broad range of psychiatric reactions have been associated with Lyme disease including paranoia, dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, major depression, anorexia nervosa, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Depressive states among patients with late Lyme disease are fairly common, ranging across studies from 26% to 66%. The microbiology of Borrelia burgdorferi sheds light on why Lyme disease can be relapsing and remitting and why it can be refractory to normal immune surveillance and standard antibiotic regimens. Conclusions: Psychiatrists who work in endemic areas need to include Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis of any atypical psychiatric disorder. Further research is needed to identify better laboratory tests and to determine the appropriate manner (intravenous or oral) and length (weeks or months) of treatment among patients with neuropsychiatric involvement.

AB  - Dielectric thin films are critical components of microelectronic devices, and for proper device function their properties must be carefully controlled. Rapid and efficient quality control techniques are needed for characterizing these films. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the mid-IR region (400-4000 cm-1) has been widely used for qualitative characterization of solid, dielectric thin films in the microelectronics industry. The IR spectra of these films on silicon exhibit overlapping spectral bands, solid-solid molecular interactions, and nonlinear behavior of spectral bands arising from a variety of sources. Conventional univariate analysis of such spectra did not yield reliable quantitative predictions of the dielectric thin-film properties. The relatively recent appearance of quantitative IR studies of dielectric thin films has followed progress in chemistry toward multivariate analysis of IR spectral data. This article reviews some of the processing and non-IR characterization methods for dielectric thin films currently used in the production of integrated circuits, and it reviews univariate quantitative and semi-quantitative analyses that have used IR spectroscopy. It stresses recent developments in IR techniques and multivariate calibration that together permit rapid, precise, nondestructive, and quantitative determinations of various critical dielectric thin-film properties. Results from the application of quantitative IR techniques to the analysis of dielectric thin films are drawn from a review of the authors' work in the field.

AB  - Despite reservations made on its use as a means for evaluating interventions, various findings in the recent literature point to patients' and relatives' satisfaction with psychiatric services as a particularly salient and appropriate measure of outcome and quality. Even though substantial improvements have occurred in the last decade, research in the field suffers various methodological limitations regarding the study design, the instruments' construction and the lack of attention to their psychometric properties. In the last few years the need for research that develops and refines measures of client satisfaction and establishes their psychometric properties has been considered a priority in service evaluation by a growing number of authors. In spite of this, in the mental health field very few validated instruments for the measurement of satisfaction are currently available. The aims of the present paper were: (1) to update work done in the field of satisfaction with mental health services in the last decade; (2) to describe the main instruments currently available to measure patients' and relatives' satisfaction with mental health services; (3) to provide guidelines for the future development of instruments and their use in mental health settings. The author concludes by emphasizing that, in order to make further progress, considerable effort is needed in developing and spreading the use of validated instruments and discouraging the use of ad hoc measures. Comparability between studies should be pursued more vigorously in order allow both the refinement of existing instruments and a better understanding of the theoretical and substantive meaning of satisfaction with psychiatric services.

AB  - Background: Recent research from North America has demonstrated higher than expected rates of drug and alcohol abuse among the seriously mentally ill. Schizophrenics appear to be particularly susceptible to the negative effects of substance abuse. These include psychiatric and social complications, with antisocial behaviour, particularly violence emerging as one of the most worrying features. This review examines the strength of the association and explores the possible explanations for the apparent link between schizophrenia, substance and abuse and violence.
   Method: The literature was searched using Medline, supplemented with a manual literature search.
   Results: Very few articles specifically approached the problem of violence among substance abusing schizophrenics, but over 80 papers were identified which were helpful in exploring the link between dangerous behaviour and substance abuse by schizophrenics.
   Conclusions: While there is circumstantial evidence to support the hypothesis that schizophrenics who abuse drugs or alcohol are at an increased risk of behaving violently, longitudinal studies are required to facilitate a better understanding of the mediating mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: To examine the evidence concerning the psychological consequences of abortion. the risk of suicide in pregnancy and the psychological consequences for the mother and the child in cases of refused abortion. Method: An extensive literature search was undertaken and key relevant papers were examined and analysed. Results: Legal abortion has become more widely available throughout the western world and the actual reported incidence of cases of refused abortion is low. The majority of studies indicate that the psychological consequences of abortion itself are in the main mild and transient but there is evidence that women who have strong religious or cultural attitudes negative to abortion do experience high levels of psychological stress following abortion. The risk of suicide is low in pregnancy and suicide is a rare outcome of refused abortion. There is evidence-of psychological and social difficulties experienced by mothers of unwanted pregnancies forced to proceed to term and by many offspring of such unwanted pregnancies. Conclusions: Definitive conclusions are difficult to draw from the published studies of refused abortion and many studies are over thirty years old.

AB  - The author focuses first on the cultural background which stimulated Freud and led to some of his conclusions on the importance and meaning of 'Oedipus Rex' and 'Hamlet' for his discovery of the Oedipus complex. He stresses the significance of Freud's education and the influence of the late eighteenth and nineteenth-century tradition of the German-speaking intellectuals. The author uses the sources of Freud's actual or possible readings from 1897 leading up to the publication of 'The Interpretation of Dreams' to support the evidence for his thesis of the complex interaction between Freud and his cultural background The author tentatively tries to show that even post-Freudian interpretations of 'Oedipus Rex' cannot be considered without looking at parallel research taking place in fields other than psychoanalysis. He stresses the importance of myth in post-Freudian psychoanalysis and particularly focuses on the relationship between the myth of Narcissus and 'Oedipus Rex' and what this gave rise to. He concludes his paper by stressing that as Freud's interpretations of the 'Oedipus Rex' do show the influence of the cultural context in which he operated, the same can be said for our interpretations too. They are part of a changing historical process, but at the same time they contain some permanent values.

AB  - We examined the influence of chronic cocaine exposure, in an unlimited access self-administration paradigm, on density of the dopamine transporter (H-3-WIN 35,428 and H-3-GBR 12,935 binding) and concentration of monoamine (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and metabolites) neurotransmitters in rat brain. In normal rodent striatum H-3-WIN 35,428 and H-3-GBR 12,935 binding to the dopamine transporter, although generally similar, showed different subregional rostrocaudal and mediolateral gradients, suggesting that the two ligands might bind to different subtypes or states of the dopamine transporter. Following chronic, unlimited access cocaine self-administration, binding of 3H-WIN 35,428 was significantly elevated in whole nucleus accumbens (+69%, p < 0.001) and striatum (+65%, p < 0.001) on the last day of cocaine exposure (''on-cocaine group''); whereas in the 3 week withdrawn animals (''cocaine-withdrawn group''), levels were either normal (striatum) or reduced (-30%, p < 0.05, nucleus accumbens). Although similar changes in H-3-GBR 12,935 binding were observed, this dopamine transporter ligand showed a smaller and highly subregionally dependent increase in binding in striatal subdivisions of the on-cocaine group, but a more marked binding reduction in the cocaine withdrawn animals. As compared with the controls, mean dopamine levels were reduced in striatum (-15%, p < 0.05) of the on-cocaine group and in nucleus accumbens (-40%, p < 0.05) of the cocaine-withdrawn group. These data provide additional support to the hypothesis that some of the long-term effects of cocaine exposure (drug craving, depression) could be consequent to reduced nucleus accumbens dopamine function. Our data also suggest that dopamine transporter concentration, and perhaps function, might undergo up- or downregulation, either as a direct effect of cocaine, or indirectly as part of a homeostatic response to altered synaptic dopamine levels, and therefore might participate in the neuronal events underlying cocaine-induced behavioral changes.

The KAIT has been very carefully developed and field-tested. Administration is facilitated by high-quality materials and visual/auditory presentation formats. The KAIT has been standardized by state-of-the-art measurement techniques. The utilization of fluid and crystallized scales enhances the richness of clinical interpretations that can be drawn from this instrument. Limitations of the KAIT are discussed regarding its use with the mentally retarded, developmentally delayed, and borderline clients.

AB  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd ed., rev.) (DSM-III-R) diagnosis of conduct disorder assumes that all children who engage in three or more criterion antisocial behaviors for 6 months or more suffer from a mental disorder. It resists all contextual information about a child's developmental history, capacities strengths and circumstances, and assumes that the antisocial behavior necessarily stems from an underlying disorder. In this review, we use Mark Twain's narrative of the lives of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as a point of departure for questioning the reasonableness of this assumption, and for examining normal as well as pathological pathways to antisocial behavior. We begin by reviewing the status of earlier controversies about the mental disorder concept in the service of documenting the impressive progress of the field in conceptualizing disorder. Next, we examine Wakefield's (1992a, 1992b) recently introduced ''harmful dysfunction'' concept of mental disorder and employ its criteria to evaluate the hypothesis that chronic antisocial behavior in childhood as defined by DSM-III-R is caused by an underlying mental disorder. We also examine some of the difficulties in discriminating between disorder- and nondisorder-based antisocial behavior, and consider issues that warrant attention in future theoretical and empirical work. Finally, we explore the pragmatic rather than scientific basis for DSM-III-R's mental disorder claim and argue that regardless of its status as a mental disorder, this most troubling and harmful behavior syndrome of childhood deserves the intensive interest, concern, and resources of the scientific and public health communities.

AB  - Beyond the continuing use of neuroleptic medication, psychopharmacological treatment approaches during the maintenance phase of schizophrenia often involve adjunctive medication. Appropriate use of such 'polypharmacy' can be crucial to patients in achieving their optimal levels of symptom management and functional capacity, although the risks of side-effects and medication interactions must be weighed. This paper reviews the use of adjunctive anti-Parkinsonian medication, benzodiazepines, propranolol, antidepressants, lithium, and carbamazepine in this context. It also explores a strategy of identifying secondary syndromes in the longitudinal course of schizophrenia which can be approached psychopharmacologically.

AB  - In the first section of this paper several aspects of tardive dyskinesia (TD) (clinical, epidemiological, pharmacological) are reviewed. We propose that this syndrome is not the consequence of dopamine receptor proliferation, but results from damage or degeneration of striatal cholinergic interneurons. We suggest that this cellular damage is caused by prolonged overactivation of these neurons, which occurs when they are released from dopaminergic inhibition following neuroleptic administration. Overactivity of central cholinergic systems during akinetic and motor retarded depression could be a contributory cause. The predisposition to L-DOPA-induced peak-dose dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease may depend on the same type of striatal neuronal loss. In the second part of the paper, the subject of supersensitivity psychosis and drug-resistant schizophrenia is reviewed. These two syndromes, are commonly associated with TD, have similar predisposing factors and pharmacology to TD, and are potentially persistent. We suggest that these conditions also result from degeneration of cholinergic striatal interneurons following chronic neuroleptic administration. The efficacy of clozapine for such treatment-refractory psychoses is explained in terms of its blockade of D-1 dopamine receptors. Other drugs effective against refractory psychoses (e.g. risperidone) are predicted to reduce activation at D-1 receptors.

AB  - For years research in fields such as biologic psychiatry and hypertension has benefited from the use of receptor measures. It is only recently however, that investigators in the field of psychosomatic medicine have taken advantage of this methodology. Much of this research revolves around discerning the roles that adrenergic receptors play in stressful events and stress-related behaviors. Thus far, psychosomatic studies have focused primarily on three areas: 1) The effects of psychosocial stressors on adrenergic receptor function, 2) the relationship between adrenergic receptors and cardiovascular responses to stressors, and 3) the relationship between adrenergic receptor measures and coronary-prone behaviors. Although several important methodological issues need to be addressed, current studies are helping to decipher longstanding questions regarding the complex processes underlying behavior, stress, immunity, and the sympathetic nervous system. This paper reviews the progress and limitations of this research blossoming field.

AB  - The goal of this article is to explore the utility of integrating two lines of research on questions of modifiability or plasticity of human development. The first line, dealing with the notion of resilience, originated within the field of clinical developmental research. The second line, concerned with developmental reserve capacity, evolved primarily within the field of life-span developmental psychology. Resilience addresses questions of maintenance and recovery of adaptation in the face of stress. In addition, ideas about levels of reserve capacity, rooted in life-span developmental psychology, emphasize the potential for growth. A review of research in the areas of cognitive and self-related functioning provides evidence for resilience as well as developmental reserve capacity in adulthood and old age. It is argued that across the life span reserve capacity is increasingly allocated to resilience-related processes (maintenance of functioning and recovery from dysfunction) rather than growth. A model of successful aging is discussed which suggests that, by means of selective optimization with compensation, old age nevertheless continues to hold the potential for selective growth.

Methods: The authors conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE for relevant articles.  Results: Some panic patients have a chronic, subtle respiratory disturbance. Acute hyperventilation is neither necessary nor sufficient for panic to occur. Respiratory abnormalities in panic patients may adaptively aim at coping with a hypersensitive CO2 chemoreceptor system.  Pharmacologic panicogens also stimulate the respiratory system, causing hyperventilation. Triggering this hypersensitive respiratory control mechanism may in panic. Antipanic medications may reset the receptor threshold. Misattribution and catastrophic interpretation of somatic symptoms or the sense of loss of control may contribute to panic symptoms. Behavioral interventions such as desensitization or breathing retraining may block the full-blown attack. Cognitive strategies through cognitive control of respiration may supplement and accentuate these interventions.  Conclusions: Panic disorder may be due to an inherently unstable autonomic nervous system, coupled with cognitive distress.

TI  - THE VIETNAM-WAR AND THE ETHICS OF COMBAT PSYCHIATRY
AB  - It has been two decades since American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, yet ere been little interest in resolving challenges that arose during the war regarding the ethical justification for military psychiatry's principles and field techniques for treating combat-generated casualties. Recently, thousands of American servicepersons were sent to fight in the Middle East accompanied by psychiatrists trained to use the same military treatment doctrine. In the wars before Vietnam, this doctrine had proved to be highly effective for treating individuals with combat stress casualties and returning them to duty. Furthermore, it was uncontroversial and later successfully adapted for use with civilian populations. During the Vietnam war, however, many psychiatrists intensely opposed a treatment regimen designed to induce symptomatic soldiers to believe that facing further combat risks would be in their best interest or that of the nation. As this review of the doctrine's rationale and ethical quandaries suggests, combat psychiatrists are influenced by powerful, potentially competing value systems but cannot realistically assess some of the most important factors that affect the balance of harm and benefit associated with their treatment decisions. This latest armed conflict reminds us of critical moral and ethical questions regarding the divided loyalties of combat psychiatrists-questions that should be addressed through future research and formalized professional guidelines.

AB  - Fundamental to spatial knowledge in all species are the representations underlying object recognition, object search, and navigation through space.  But what sets humans apart from other species is our ability to express spatial experience through language. This target article explores the language of objects and places, asking what geometric properties are preserved in the representations underlying object nouns and spatial prepositions in English. Evidence from these two aspects of language suggests there are significant differences in the geometric richness with which objects and places are encoded.  When an object is named (i.e., with count nouns), detailed geometric properties - principally the object's shape (axes, solid and hollow volumes, surfaces, and parts) - are represented. In contrast, when an object plays the role of either ''figure'' (located object) or ''ground'' (reference object) in a locational expression, only very coarse geometric object properties are represented, primarily the main axes. In addition, the spatial functions encoded by spatial prepositions tend to be nonmetric and relatively coarse, for example, ''containment'' ''contact,'' ''relative distance'' and ''relative direction.'' These properties are representative of other languages as well. The striking differences in the way language encodes objects versus places lead us to suggest two explanations: First, there is a tendency for languages to level out geometric detail from both object and place representations. Second, a nonlinguistic disparity between the representations of ''what'' and ''where'' underlies how language represents objects and places. The language of objects and places converges with and enriches our understanding of corresponding spatial representations.

AB  - Objective: An approach referred to as ''supported housing,'' based on principles of consumer choice, integrated community housing, and flexible services, is replacing residential treatment facilities for persons with psychiatric disabilities. To improve understanding of the new approach, its evolution, and issues involved in its implementation, this paper reviews studies of the effectiveness of traditional housing programs and early reports of the development of supported housing programs. Methods: A data base of more than 4,000 journal articles and book chapters published over the past 15 years was searched; both research studies and policy analyses were included. Results and conclusions: Because of national and state policy shifts toward supported housing and growing evidence that both consumers and their families favor this new approach, supported housing models appear to be increasingly replicated throughout the U.S. Innovative financing strategies, such as forming coalitions to develop housing or creating capital funds, have been implemented. Results from studies of established programs indicate that support services for consumers should include working with individuals to formulate their housing and support goals; financial assistance in acquiring long-term stable housing; help in searching for an apartment and moving; assistance in managing money and participating in leisure activities, assistance with medication; ongoing monitoring of needs; crisis support; and peer support. Future research should focus on promoting consumers' choices and organizing flexible services to help them succeed in the community.

AB  - Since Darwin, the idea of intellectual continuity has gripped comparative psychology. Psychological evolution has been viewed as the accumulation of gradual changes over time, resulting in an unbroken chain of mental capacities throughout the diversity of life. Some researchers have even maintained that no fundamental psychological differences exist among species. An alternative model argues that a rather profound new psychology related to mental state attribution may have evolved recently in the primate order. The author explores recent experimental research from chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and children that is consistent with this second model of psychological evolution. Drawing on the fields of developmental, comparative, and social psychology, as well as evolutionary and developmental biology, the author outlines a research agenda aimed at reconstructing the evolution of metacognition.

AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed both clinical data and selected laboratory research related to withdrawal from alcohol, opiates, and stimulants in order to draw a conclusion about whether the phenomenon of protracted withdrawal exists and should be included in DSM-IV. Method: Studies were located through computerized searches and reference sections of published articles. Results: Symptoms extending beyond the period of acute withdrawal in alcohol and opiate dependence have been fairly consistently described; this is not the case with cocaine. Nevertheless, protracted alcohol and opiate withdrawal has not been conclusively demonstrated because of the failure of studies to do multiple time point sampling, to use standardized instruments and control groups, and to readminister the substance in an attempt to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Further, the concept of protracted withdrawal itself is ambiguously defined. This confounds interpretation of the literature and precludes derivation of a unified concept of the term, which would be necessary for adding the diagnosis to DSM-IV. Conclusions: There is insufficient documentation to justify inclusion of protracted withdrawal in DSM-IV because of methodologic limitations of the studies and lack of consensus definition of the term itself. An outline for conceptualizing protracted withdrawal is offered in which the symptoms can be seen as 1) a global postuse syndrome, 2) attenuated physiologic rebound, 3) toxic residuals, 4) expression of preexisting symptoms unmasked by cessation of use. Future efforts to identify signs and symptoms of protracted withdrawal should carefully define the parameters of the syndrome.

AB  - The frequency of compulsory admissions to psychiatric hospitals varies considerably between countries and regions. However, the differences are partly artificial, as the figures available are not fully comparable; this is mainly owing to differing definitions of ''compulsory'' and the methodological shortcomings of most studies in this field. In addition, there are also clear real differences, most of which result from different legislation and administrative regulations. Characteristics of the patient that influence the risk of compulsory admission include diagnosis and certain sociodemographic and social factors. Most studies, however, are based on highly selected populations. Furthermore, the results depend heavily on the commitment frequency of a country and therefore eventually also on the restrictiveness of legislation. The lack of methodologically sound studies, internationally comparable data and internationally published information is regrettable, as international comparison and discussion would certainly be valuable, especially for countries that are in the process of re-evaluating their commitment criteria and mental health legislation.

AB  - Coral reef bleaching, the whitening of diverse invertebrate taxa, results from the loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae and/or a reduction in photosynthetic pigment concentrations in zooxanthellae residing within the gastrodermal tissues of host animals. Of particular concern are the consequences of bleaching of large numbers of reef-building scleractinian corals and hydrocorals. Published records of coral reef bleaching events from 1870 to the present suggest that the frequency (60 major events from 1979 to 1990), scale (co-occurrence in many coral reef regions and often over the bathymetric depth range of corals) and severity (> 95% mortality in some areas) of recent bleaching disturbances are unprecedented in the scientific literature. The causes of small scale, isolated bleaching events can often be explained by particular stressors (e.g., temperature, salinity, light, sedimentation, aerial exposure and pollutants), but attempts to explain large scale bleaching events in terms of possible global change (e.g., greenhouse warming, increased UV radiation flux, deteriorating ecosystem health, or some combination of the above) have not been convincing. Attempts to relate the severity and extent of large scale coral reef bleaching events to particular causes have been hampered by a lack of (a) standardized methods to assess bleaching and (b) continuous, long-term data bases of environmental conditions over the periods of interest. An effort must be made to understand the impact of bleaching on the remainder of the reef community and the long-term effects on competition, predation, symbioses, bioerosion and substrate condition, all factors that can influence coral recruitment and reef recovery. If projected rates of sea warming are realized by mid to late AD 2000, i.e. a 2-degrees-C increase in high latitude coral seas, the upper thermal tolerance limits of many reef-building corals could be exceeded. Present evidence suggests that many corals would be unable to adapt physiologically or genetically to such marked and rapid temperature in creases.

AB  - In this review article I describe a model of the nucleon whose ingredients are quark, meson and hybrid or meikton fields. The strategy has been to choose a suitable lagrangian and treat it in the mean field approximation. The model is easily extended to low-lying states of other baryons - strange and nonstrange.
   The model is chiral invariant with small but appropriate chiral invariance breaking terms. It is based on the color dielectric model of Nielsen and Patkos. The vanishing of the color dielectric function in the vacuum, an indispensable element of the model, has been justified on the basis of the area law of QCD. The model has essential connection to the two major characteristics of the QCD vacuum, viz, gluon and quark condensates. Specifically, fluctuations of the two condensates, hybrids and mesons, are ingredients of the model. Physical quantities of the model have the same large N, behavior as the corresponding quantities in QCD. The last three features encourage us to hope that the model may have basis in QCD. The question of coexistence of quarks and bosons in an effective lagrangian has been considered with care. The conclusion is that in a confining model the quark field must be retained. But only tree graphs should be evaluated. The contributions of quark loops appear through the bosonic lagrangian.
   I argue that no special action needs to be taken in incorporating the role of the trace anomaly of QCD in an effective lagrangian. The trace of stress-energy tensor of our effective lagrangian is nonzero at the classical level. It should be interpreted as the manifestation of the QCD trace anomaly.
   A difficulty which plagues most confining models is that the product of the nucleon mass and the rms matter radius turns out to be approximately 6 or greater. This problem has been essentially eliminated by the inclusion of the 't Hooft interaction.

AB  - Occupational stress research continues to grow, and is increasingly being used to inform national policy on worker health and well-being. Most models of occupational stress emphasize notions of person-environment fit. Two approaches for intervention to minimize adverse consequences of occupational stress follow from such models. One emphasizes the strengthening and enhancement of individuals and their resources, the other emphasizes the reduction of common workplace-based sources of occupational stress. This paper reviews 10 organizational-level interventions to reduce stress at work which have been examined in various field studies. These interventions were generally found to have positive effects, and, given the limited success of individual-level interventions in addressing occupational sources of stress, should be encouraged.

AB  - The search for novel therapeutics for human cognitive disorders has intensified. Neurotransmitter replacement therapies represent a short-term hope for treating cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, however, is clearly a neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by a loss of synaptic elements. Ultimately, synaptic loss must be halted to alter the disease course. Agents mimicking or modulating the actions of neurotrophic factors may be useful. They may restore lost function and exert ananbolic effects on existing neurons, making treated cells less susceptible to neurotoxic insult (i.e., excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, etc.). Intervening in the biogenesis of amyloid plaques and blunting local inflammatory responses may provide the ultimate treatment for AD. The success of any treatment, however, rests on early diagnosis. Early intervention in the neurodegenerative disease process will be required. Without early intervention, the risk of maintaining patients in a premorbid state is high. Therefore, it is likely that no single approach will provide optimal therapy for the AD patient and multifactorial treatment strategies may be required.

AB  - The dopaminergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex is able to transsynaptically regulate the activity of subcortical dopamine innervations. Disruption of the prefrontal cortical DA innervation results in the enhanced biochemical responsiveness of the dopamine innervation of the nucleus accumbens. We present recent data indicating that distinct prefrontal cortical dopamine innervations can be functionally dissociated on the basis of responsiveness to stress. The ventral striatal projection target (nucleus accumbens shell) of the prefrontal cortical region that is stress sensitive is also responsive to stress. In this manner interconnected cortico-striato-pallido-mesencephalic loops can be defined on the basis of the biochemical responsive of local dopamine systems to stress and on the basis of responsiveness to antipsychotic drugs. These data suggest the functional derangement of a distinct corticofugal loops in schizophrenia and in certain aspects of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Objective: Dysphoric Premenstrual Syndromes (PMS) are quite prevalent and in some women they are severe enough to warrant treatment. Their pathophysiology is still unknown, despite increased interest and research. Here we review the possible role of serotonin in the multidimensional interactive pathophysiology of PMS. Method: Over 170 articles are reviewed. An extensive library search has been conducted and articles are included because of their relevance to: 1) the phenomenology of PMS; 2) the putative association of serotonergic (5-HT) activity with syndromes that occur premenstrually; 3) changes in 5-HT activity along the menstrual cycle, especially the late luteal phase; 4) influence of gonadal hormones on serotonergic functions; 5) endocrine strategies for assessment of 5-HT abnormalities; and 6) treatment studies of PMS with serotonergic agonists. Results and Conclusions: The data presented here suggest that post-synaptic serotonergic responsivity might be altered during the late-luteal-premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. Some serotonergic functions of women with PMS might be altered during the entire cycle and be associated with a vulnerability trait. It is hypothesized that gonadal hormones might cause changes in levels of activity of 5-HT systems as part of a multidimensional interactive system. Strategies to evaluate 5-HT activities in the context of the menstrual cycle are discussed-leading to the conclusion that the most promising approach is active stimulation with specific post-synaptic serotonin agonists. Treatment outcome studies of some imperfect compounds that are currently applied as a symptomatic treatment of PMS support the notion that 5-HT is involved in the pathophysiology of these syndromes.

The purpose of this article, therefore, is to provide a framework for understanding the analytical review process, to review the extant analytical review research within this framework, and to identify profitable areas for future research.
   To accomplish these goals, this article takes a cognitive orientation and characterizes analytical review as a diagnostic, sequential, and iterative (DSI) process. Diagnostic reasoning appears to be an important part of analytical review in light of recent descriptive research (Blocher and Cooper 1988), which finds that auditors performing this task typically perform the four distinct components of diagnostic inference: mental representation, hypothesis generation, information search, and hypothesis evaluation. Analytical review also is sequential since the auditor must acquire sufficient information to identify an unexpected fluctuation before generating potential causes for an observed fluctuation and seeking out and evaluating information relevant to those causes. Finally, the task is iterative since the auditor may re-perform components, if necessary.
   The expected contributions of this article are twofold. First, this article should allow both academics and practitioners to better understand the process of analytical review and also to more fully appreciate its significant cognitive components. Second, by describing the prior research and identifying topics for future research, this article should encourage researchers to consider where their efforts may be most productive. Such focus will necessarily enhance our understanding of analytical review.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence which supports the association between psychosocial factors and genital herpes simplex virus recurrences (HSV), as well as to examine the biological and psychological treatments for disease. Method: Forty-five studies were reviewed from the years 1928 to 1991. Studies were identified via computerized biographic literature search of Psychological Abstracts and Medline. Additional studies were located by inspection of key article reference sections. Studies were included in the review if the sample consisted of recurrent genital herpes sufferers and the design was either correlational or experimental. Cases studies were reviewed if they described HSV psychiatric treatment and provided outcome information. Results: Psychosocial variables are important elements in the prediction, maintenance, and management of recurrent genital herpes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of psychological treatment regimes may be explained via psychoimmunological theory. Conclusions: Psychosocial treatment should be considered as adjunctive therapy for biological treatment of recurrent HSV infections. Future research should address primary prevention of genital herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infections.

AB  - Preclinical and clinical evidence supports a theory of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) dysregulation in bulimia. We therefore studied the prolactin (PRL) and cortisol responses following challenges with the postsynaptic 5-HT receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), 0.5 mg/kg orally, the 5-HT precursor L-tryptophan, 100 mg/kg intravenously, and placebo in a group of 28 normal weight bulimic patients and 16 healthy controls. Patients with bulimia, regardless of the presence of major depression, had significantly blunted PRL responses following m-CPP administration compared with those in controls. In contrast, only bulimic patients with concurrent major depression had significantly blunted PRL responses following L-tryptophan administration compared with those in nondepressed bulimic patients and controls. Cortisol responses following m-CPP were not significantly different for bulimic patients vs controls, although there was a trend toward blunted cortisol responses following L-tryptophan administration in the depressed bulimic patients. These differences in neuroendocrine responses were not related to differences in age, percent of average body weight, medications, time of day, peak plasma drug levels, or baseline estradiol levels. Seasonal variations in PRL responses to both agents were identified, although covariation for season did not alter the group differences. The PRL responses following m-CPP administration were inversely correlated to baseline cortisol levels in the bulimic patients, but not in the controls, suggesting a dampening effect by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction on postsynaptic 5-HT receptor sensitivity. The reasons for the differing hormonal responses to these two serotonergic agents may relate to differential involvement of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms, 5-HT receptor subtypes, and anatomical loci of action. The blunted PRL responses to m-CPP administration suggest that postsynaptic 5-HT receptor sensitivity is altered in bulimia nervosa, and that similar alterations in 5-HT receptors at or above the level of the hypothalamus may contribute to binge eating and other behavioral symptoms.

AB  - It has become increasingly accepted that pain is not simply a sensation generated by nociceptors, but a perceptual phenomenon with particular emotional qualities. The purpose of this article is to bring together vastly different streams of research on the divisibility of pain into sensory and affective components. Empirical evidence for this divisibility is drawn from recent studies using multivariate statistics, signal detection theory, and unidimensional scaling. An important conclusion is that separable though pain components may be, they are not necessarily independent. In critiquing previous research, new criteria are derived for partitioning pain into sensory and affective components. Finally, speculations are offered as to how these same components might be synthesized on the basis of theories of perceptual organization.

AB  - The discovery of different GABA receptor subtypes has stimulated research relating this neurotransmitter to a variety of behavioral functions and clinical disorders. The development of new and specific GABAergic compounds has made it possible to try to identify the specific functions of these receptors. The purpose of the present review is to evaluate the data regarding the functions of the GABA receptor subtypes in different behaviors such as motor function, reproduction, learning and memory, and aggressive-defensive behaviors. A description of GABAergic functions (stress, peripheral effects, thermoregulation) that might directly or indirectly affect behavior is also included. The possible involvement of GABA in different neurological and psychiatric disorders is also discussed. Although much research has been done trying to identify the possible role of GABA in different behaviors, the role of receptor subtypes has only recently attracted attention, and only preliminary data are available at present. It is therefore evident that still much work has to be done before a clear picture of the behavioral significance of these receptor subtypes can be obtained. Nevertheless, existing data are sufficient to justify the prediction that GABAergic agents, in the near future, will be much used in the field of behavioral pharmacology. It is hoped that the present review will contribute to this. Some specific suggestions concerning the most efficient way to pursue future research are also made.

AB  - To review data supporting or not supporting the designation of unipolar psychotic major depression as a distinct syndrome in DSM-IV, the authors used computerized literature searches to identify reports of studies that have directly compared the characteristics, biology, familial transmission, course/outcome, and response to treatment of psychotic and nonpsychotic major depression. The review showed that statistically significant differences between the two types of depression have been found on each of these dimensions. There are greater guilt feelings and psychomotor disturbance, among other features, in psychotic depression. Studies have found significant differences between patients with psychotic and nonpsychotic depression in glucocorticoid activity, dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity, levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites, sleep measures, and ventricle-to-brain ratios. Family studies show higher rates of bipolar disorder in first-degree relatives of probands with psychotic major depression than of probands with nonpsychotic major depression. Greater morbidity and residual impairment have also been reported in patients with psychotic major depression, and they respond more poorly to placebo and to tricyclic antidepressants. Differences between patients with psychotic and nonpsychotic major depression on many of these measures were not due to differences in severity or endogenicity. Since the data indicate that psychotic and nonpsychotic major depression can be separated, the frequency with which the diagnosis of psychotic major depression is missed and its unique course and response to treatment point to the practical importance of a separate diagnosis for this disorder. However, further studies are needed to resolve important methodological issues and to develop an optimal set of operational criteria.

AB  - A number of child-, family-, and system-focused interventions have been designed to prevent or reduce the negative effects of divorce on children.  This article critically evaluates these intervention efforts by examining (a) their relation to basic research on the processes proposed to mediate children's postdivorce adjustment and (b) evaluation studies assessing the effectiveness of various programs.  Although interventions address some of the factors proposed to mediate children's adaptation to divorce, the interplay between interventions and basic research on children's postdivorce adaptation is limited.  Moreover, some intervention efforts appear to be beneficial, but most lack empirical documentation of their efficacy.  This analysis leads to several recommendations for basic and applied research and for improving the response of the mental health field to the problems experienced by many children from divorcing families.

The review starts with a brief discussion of methodological procedures followed by the description of known patterns of oscillation in body temperature, including ultradian and infradian rhythms. Special sections are devoted to issues of species differences, development and aging, and the relationships between the CRT and the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity, between the CRT and the thermoregulatory system, and between the CRT and states of disease. A section on the nervous control of the CRT is followed by summary and conclusions.

AB  - Using mainly United Kingdom estuaries as examples, various factors governing the bioavailability, bioaccumulation and biological effects of heavy metals in sediment-dominated estuaries are reviewed. Estuaries and metals primarily discussed include the Mersey (Hg, methylmercury; Pb, alkyllead), the Loughor (Cr, Sn), the Severn (Ag, Cd), the Fal (As, Cu, Sn, Zn), Poole Harbour (Cd, Hg, Se, tributyltin) and Southampton Water (tributyltin).
   Concentrations and bioavailabilities of metals in estuarine sediments depend on many different processes. Examples include (1) mobilisation of metals to the interstitial water and their chemical speciation, (2) transformation (e.g. methylation) of metals including As, Hg, Pb and Sn, (3) the control exerted by major sediment components (e.g. oxides of Fe and organics) to which metals are preferentially bound, (4) competition between sediment metals (e.g. Cu and Ag; Zn and Cd) for uptake sites in organisms, and (5) the influence of bioturbation, salinity, redox or pH on these processes.
   Under field conditions, identification of dominant processes can be achieved by observing the goodness of fit between metal concentrations in ubiquitous deposit-feeding species and levels in various types of sediment extract over a wide spectrum of sediment types. Factors of more local importance are often indicated by the marked deviation of some points from otherwise excellent relationships. For example, points lying above the line relating tissue Sn concentrations in the clam Scrobicularia plana to those in 1 N HCl extracts of sediments were found to reflect the accumulation of tributyltin, a more readily bioavailable form of Sn. In the same species, unexpectedly high tissue-Cu concentrations were characteristic of very anoxic sediments and tissue As and Pb concentrations were suppressed in sediments having high concentrations of Fe oxides.
   Under field conditions, examples of deleterious effects on benthic organisms that can be attributed to specific metallic pollutants are comparatively rare. Effects of tributyltins from antifouling paints on oysters and neogastropods have been documented and their toxicity has undoubtedly led to environmental degradation in many UK estuaries and coastal areas. In estuaries contaminated with metal-mining wastes, the effects of Cu and Zn on species distribution can be observed, but they are generally less obvious than would be predicted from experimental data. Effects are ameliorated by the induction of metal tolerance mechanisms in some species and in others by the appearance of tolerant strains. The induction of metal detoxification systems involving the formation of granules or metal-binding proteins leads in some species to tissue concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than normal. For example, high concentrations of Cd and Ag have been found in some species from the Severn Estuary, although there is no unequivocal evidence that either metal has caused deleterious effects on benthic populations. On the other hand, experimental studies with Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg and Zn show that they are toxic to some species at environmentally realistic levels. Since pollutants rarely occur singly, it is likely that in many moderately contaminated estuaries metals contribute to the stress to organisms caused by substances requiring detoxification. There has been much speculation over the years concerning the biomagnification of metals with increasing trophic levels along food chains. Whilst animals having higher metal concentrations than their prey are sometimes found, the only consistent evidence of biomagnification concerns methylmercury.
   When estuarine birds are considered, there are relatively few instances in which deleterious effects can unequivocally be attributed to metals or their compounds. However, the Mersey bird kill was attributable to alkyllead pollution from industry. Among other organometals, methylmercury has proved toxic to birds but, so far, no evidence for the toxicity of tributyltin has been reported. However, the compound may have affected bird populations through its effects on the abundance of prey organisms, particularly estuarine molluscs. Of the inorganic forms of metals, Pb in the form of shot has caused problems in many areas and Cd, Hg and Se are suspected of causing toxic effects. There is little field evidence that birds have been affected by Ag, As, Cr, Cu or Zn individually. On the other hand, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that, additively, these metals may produce a significant effect. In part, the lack of evidence reflects the fact that relatively little research has been done. There is scope for more work on metals and organometals in estuarine birds, particularly with regard to their metabolism and their effects on juveniles and individuals subjected to stresses such as starvation.

AB  - The Nithsdale surveys over a ten year period have examined a community of schizophrenic patients.  Although almost three-quarters of patients were living outside hospital, social and psychiatric disability was considerable, with flattening of affect and social withdrawal most prominent.  The majority probably cause little disturbance to most people in the community.  Only 13 % of the total Nithsdale schizophrenic population were living in a high contact/high Expressed Emotion family, the family structure believed to be most conducive to schizophrenic relapse.  An attempt at family intervention found it difficult to engage relatives in treatment; however, where such intervention did take place, there was a fall in the total number of relapses.  Reassessment found that the level of EE was stable in most relatives over a five year period.  Patients who lived in a high or fluctuating EE home, and who relapsed, did so more often than those who lived in a low EE home.  Assessment of the prevalence of motor disorders secondary to antipsychotic medication found a point prevalence of parkinsonism of 27 %, of tardive dyskinesia (TD) 29 %, and of akathisia or pseudoakathisia 23 %.  Only 44 % had no movement disorder.  Eight percent had persistent TD.  Parkinsonism was associated with a history of obstetric complications and TD with left-handedness.  An obstetric history obtained from mothers of schizophrenic patients found there was no difference in the proportion of schizophrenic patients and their sibs who had at least one definite obstetric complication.

AB  - One of the most difficult problems within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AT) is that of processing language by computer, or natural-language processing. A major problem in natural-language processing is to build theories and models of how individual utterances cling together into a coherent discourse. The problem is important because, to properly understand natural language, a computer should have some sense of what it means for a discourse to be coherent and rational. Theories, models and implementations of natural-language processing argue for a measure of coherence based on three themes: meaning, structure, and intention. Most approaches stress one theme over all the others. Their future lies in the integration of components of all approaches. A theory of intention analysis solves, in part, the problem of natural-language dialogue processing. A central principle of the theory is that coherence of natural-language dialogue can be modelled by analysing sequences of intention. The theory of intention analysis has been incorporated within a computational model, called Operating System CONsultant (OSCON), implemented in Quintus Prolog, which understands, and answers in English, English questions about computer operating systems. Theories and implementations of discourse processing will not only enable people to communicate better with computers, but also enable computers to better communicate with people.

AB  - In this article, research on the natural course of illness among first-admission schizophrenic patients is reviewed from an epidemiological perspective. Three types of studies are considered: statistical reports dating primarily from the preneuroleptic era; long-term followback studies; and more recent prospectively designed cohort studies. Although relatively more first-admission patients have a positive course than do multiple admissions patients, the findings confirm the substantial heterogeneity in course and outcome. Methodological improvements in first-admission research are suggested, including separating the analyses of first-episode patients from those with past psychotic experiences; employing longitudinal methods for deriving diagnosis; including patients with drug and alcohol problems where appropriate; enlarging the samples either by multisite or multicenter collaborations or by pooling data across studies; and obtaining better data on treatment experiences in naturalistic research.

Knowledge of the genetic basis of mental functioning, psychopathology, and neuropsychology is being furthered by this recently recognised condition. The disorder has considerable significance for psychiatrists, particularly, but by no means exclusively, those working in the field of mental handicap and with children. This review outlines the slow clarification of this complex and important behavioural phenotype and the implications of these advances for identification, diagnosis, genetic counselling and a wide range of management interventions.

AB  - The retrosplenial cortex is situated at the crossroads between the hippocampal formation and many areas of the neocortex, but few studies have examined the connections between the hippocampal formation and the retrosplenial cortex in detail. Each subdivision of the retrosplenial cortex projects to a discrete terminal field in the hippocampal formation. The retrosplenial dysgranular cortex (Rdg) projects to the postsubiculum, caudal parts of parasubiculum, caudal and lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex, and the perirhinal cortex. The retrosplenial granular b cortex (Rgb) projects only to the postsubiculum, but the retrosplenial granular a cortex (Rga) projects to the postsubiculum, rostral presubiculum, parasubiculum, and caudal medial entorhinal cortex. Reciprocating projections from the hippocampal formation to Rdg originate in septal parts of CA1, postsubiculum, and caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex, but these are only sparse projections. In contrast, Rgb and Rga receive dense projections from the hippocampal formation. The hippocampal projection to Rgb originates in area CA1, dorsal (septal) subiculum, and postsubiculum. Conversely, Rga is innervated by ventral (temporal) subiculum and postsubiculum. Further, the connections between the retrosplenial cortex and the hippocampal formation are topographically organized. Rostral retrosplenial cortex is connected primarily to the septal (rostrodorsal) hippocampal formation, while caudal parts of the retrosplenial cortex are connected with temporal (caudoventral) areas of the hippocampal formation. Together, the elaborate connections between the retrosplenial cortex and the hippocampal formation suggest that this projection provides an important pathway by which the hippocampus affects learning, memory, and emotional behavior.

Various receptor/transmitter theories of depressive disorders are discussed in this section. Specifically, data supporting noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and peptidergic theories, as well as interactions between noradrenergic and serotonergic, or cholinergic and catecholaminergic systems are presented. Problems with the data and future directions for research are also discussed. A previous publication, Part I of this review, dealt with the classification of depressive disorders and research techniques for studying the biochemical mechanisms of these disorders. A future publication, Part III of this review, discusses treatments for depression and some of the controversies in this field.

AB  - Insects as a group have been especially successful in adapting to subzero temperatures. Typically, an integration of behavioral and developmental adaptations, as well as physiological and biochemical ones, are required to achieve overwintering success. In keeping with the tremendous adaptive radiation of the group, individual species often exhibit considerable variation in the particular set of adaptations by which they achieve the ability to survive subzero temperatures. Two fundamental physiological mechanisms are (1) freeze tolerance, adaptations that confer the ability to survive extracellular ice formation, and (2) freeze avoidance (freeze resistance), adaptations that prevent freezing. Different populations of the same species, however, may exhibit different mechanisms, and even the same population may vary its overwintering mechanism from year to year.
   Freeze-avoidance adaptations usually involve production of antifreezes. These may be antifreeze proteins or colligative-type antifreezes, such as glycerol, which are often produced in molar concentrations. Antifreezes function not only to depress the freezing point, but also to extend the ability to supercool, an important factor since most species are protected by the cuticle from inoculation by external ice. Supercooling may also be extended by the removal of ice nucleators from the body fluids, either on an evolutionary-time scale or on a seasonal basis.
   Freeze-tolerance adaptations are likewise quite diverse. Most freeze-tolerant insects accumulate high levels of cryoprotectants, usually polyols (i.e., glycerol and sorbitol) and sugars (i.e., trehalose). The potential role of less traditional cryoprotectants, such as amino acids and methylamines, has not been properly investigated. Many freeze-tolerant species produce extracellular ice nucleators, typically hemolymph proteins, which induce nucleation at fairly high subzero temperatures and thereby inhibit lethal intracellular ice formation. Some freeze-tolerant insects, however, have removed ice nucleators completely and supercool to -50 to -60-degrees-C, while other species require inoculative freezing by external ice at temperatures only a few degrees below zero. Other adaptations may involve an increase in unfreezeable water, recrystallization inhibition by antifreeze proteins, or vitrification (glass formation) of certain pools of body water.
   In spite of considerable progress in understanding subzero temperature adaptations in insects, it is certain that crucial adaptations remain unidentified, and a primary goal of future studies must be to elucidate these mechanisms. Emphasis should also be placed on providing an integrated understanding of the overall complement of adaptations used by particular species and how these adaptations impact, and are impacted by, the ecology of the organism. The great diversity of adaptations exhibited by different species should also be further investigated.

AB  - The pathogenesis of a variety of neurological and mental disorders has been attributed to the malfunctioning of central dopaminergic systems. Twenty years of investigation concerning the way that dopamine systems function in the brain has yielded a great deal of information about the control and behavior of these systems. This collection of seemingly disparate facts is reviewed. A hypothesis is then presented that attempts to synthesize from these facts a view of the electrophysiological functioning of midbrain dopamine systems that may be helpful in understanding brain mechanisms underlying the pathology of such disorders as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

AB  - The basal ganglia were manipulated pharmacologically by using GABA antagonists and also 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in rats, cats and monkeys, and neuronal activities were recorded from the basal ganglia. It was concluded that: (1) in parkinsonism, neuronal activities of the caudate nucleus decreased, those of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the internal segment of the globus pallidus increased, and those of the ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus were depressed markedly; (2) in dyskinesia, periodical discharges of the caudate-putamen complex were the primary event in rodents, resulting in activation of the thalamus; and (3) the caudate nucleus was involved in the manifestation or driving of locomotion, while the putamen was related to regulation of tonus in contralateral muscles with proximal dominancy.

AB  - Depression is the major psychiatric complication of Parkinson's disease, and it occurs in approximately one-third of all cases.  Diagnosis of depression is complicated by the overlap of depressive and parkinsonian symptoms.  Its etiology is not fully understood but involves changes in dopamine and serotonin.  Depression has significant clinical impact; depressed patients are more disabled (less independent).  The depressive symptoms respond to treatment with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy.

AB  - Progress has been made over the last 10 years in determining the neural mechanisms of sensitization induced by amphetamine-like psychostimulants, opioids and stressors. Changes in dopamine transmission in axon terminal fields such as the nucleus accumbens appear to underlie the expression of sensitization, but the actions of drugs and stressors in the somatodendritic regions of the A10/A9 dopamine neurons seem critical for the initiation of sensitization. Manipulations that increase somatodendritic dopamine release and permit the stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors in this region induce changes in the dopamine system that lead to the development of long-term sensitization. However, it is not known exactly how the changes in the A10/A9 region are encoded to permit augmented dopamine transmission in the terminal field. One possibility is that the dopamine neurons of sensitized animals have become increasingly sensitive to excitatory pharmacological and environmental stimuli or desensitized to inhibitory regulation. Alternatively, changes in cellular activity or protein synthesis may result in a change in the presynaptic regulation of axon terminal dopamine release.

AB  - Anxiety is a complex state that includes a broad range of classified symptoms. Anxiolytic treatment has been dominated by the use of benzodiazepine drugs (BZs), which is often prolonged. However, the multiplicity of anxiety states and the lack of BZ specificity preclude the potent targeting of the drugs to different states, and point to the problem of drug dependence. Furthermore, animal models of anxiety give different results when challenged with apparently similar drugs. The search for alternative drugs with a higher specificity has led to 5-HT receptor subtypes. In this review, Simon Green describes how recent research might have dual benefits: in improving drug therapy of anxiety in humans, and in analysing and categorizing more clearly the concept of anxiety itself.

AB  - Molluscicides are crucial for the control of schistosomiasis. The need to use plant molluscicides has received increased interest as an inexpensive technology because of the high cost of synthetic compounds for snail control in the endemic areas of poor nations of the world. Laboratory screening of Nigerian medicinal plants has shown that some of these contain chemicals which are among the most potent natural molluscicides available today. Field trials have been carried out on Tetrapleura tetraptera, locally known as Aridan, which is widely distributed in West Africa and can be collected and processed locally for the control of schistosomiasis. Research efforts in identifying botanical molluscicides, such as Aridan, should be encouraged by strong support, both from the Government and the private sector, in a current period of economic depression.

AB  - Based upon current evolutionary theory and recent laboratory and field data, this paper introduces a behavioral-ecology view of human facial displays that contrasts with previous views of faces as innate, prototypic, "iconic" expressions of fundamental emotions. First, I detail the criteria for establishing genetic and epigenetic contributions to facial behavior. Under these criteria, cross-cultural communality in canonical facial displays implies neither their genetic control nor their fundamental relation to emotion. New findings reestablish phylogenetic continuity by showing that human facial displays and vigilance for them, like their nonhuman counterparts, coevolve in the service of social motives; faces issued in solitude typically reflect imaginary or implicit interaction. Two evolutionary trends are probably involved in shaping facial actions - emancipation of reflexes, and automatization of instrumental acts. Modern conceptions of genetic and cultural evolution, and knowledge about animal signaling, suggest new hypotheses regarding the origins and functions of facial displays. In so doing, they clarify how facial displays relate to reflexion, motive and intention, emotion and psychophysiology, and language and paralanguage.

AB  - Prices of new antimalarial drugs are targeted at the "travellers' market" in developed countries, which makes them unaffordable in malaria-endemic countries where the per capita annual drug expenditures are US$ 5 or less.  Antimalarials are distributed through a variety of channels in both public and private sectors, the official malaria control programmes accounting for 25-30% of chloroquine distribution.  The unofficial drug sellers in markets, streets, and village shops account for as much as half of antimalarials distributed in many developing countries.  Use of antimalarials through the health services is often poor; drug shortages are common and overprescription and overuse of injections are significant problems.  Anxiety over drug costs may prevent patients from getting the necessary treatment for malaria, especially because of the seasonal appearance of this disease when people's cash reserves are very low.  The high costs may lead them to unofficial sources, which will sell a single tablet instead of a complete course of treatment, and subsequently to increased, often irrational demand for more drugs and more injections.  Increasingly people are resorting to self-medication for malaria, which may cause delays in seeking proper treatment in cases of failure, especially in areas where chloroquine resistance has increased rapidly.  Self-medication is now widespread, and measures to restrict the illicit sale of drugs have been unsuccessful.  The "unofficial" channels thus represent an unacknowledged extension of the health services in many countries; suggestions are advanced to encourage better self-medication by increasing the knowledge base among the population at large (mothers, schoolchildren, market sellers, and shopkeepers), with an emphasis on correct dosing and on the importance of seeking further treatment without delay, if necessary.

AB  - Recently, it has been noted that fish in acidified lakes may contain elevated levels of mercury. While there is correlation among lakes between depressed pH and high mercury concentrations in fish, the cause of this problem is unknown. A number of hypotheses have been advanced in explanation, including increased mercury deposition, changes in mercury mobility due to acidification, pH dependent changes in mercury uptake by biota, and alterations in population size and/or structure which result in increased bioaccumulation in fish. Because fish accumulate mercury mainly in an organic form, methylmercury, changes in the biogeochemical cycling of this compound might account for elevated bioaccumulation. Mercury methylation is predominantly a microbial process which occurs in situ in lakes. This review focuses on microbiological and biogeochemical changes that may lead to increased levels of methylmercury in fresh waters impacted by acid-deposition. In particular, we focus on the hypothesis that sulfate-reducing bacteria are important mediators of metal methylation in aquatic systems and, moreover, that sulfate-deposition may stimulate methylmercury production by enhancing the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in sediments.

AB  - The advantages and disadvantages, benefits and limitations, of a number of published mathematical models representing the effects of ozone on crops and native vegetation are described.  Several levels of modeling are addressed:  word models, graphic models, mathematical models, and computer simulation implementation.  Special attention is given to evaluating:  (1) how the interaction between ozone exposure and vegetation effects is quantified, (2) the status of field testing of the model, and (3) the adequacy of information for enabling other investigators to replicate the model for further testing.  Original contributions, not previously published, are made in this evaluation in the form of:  (1) graphic model flow charts for published models, (2) clarification of mathematical equations for existing models, (3) graphic forms of functional relations comprising portions of models, and (4) graphic displays of model output performance versus observed data.  The models that are evaluated cover acute exposure-response models, statistical and mechanistic-process models, including a partial model of ambient exposure versus ozone flux, and uptake.  They also cover chronic exposure statistical approaches, including time-series modeling, mechanistic-process models, 'disintegrated' models of forest system simulations, chronic flux density-uptake-response, and models for regional effects assessment in forests and agricultural lands.

AB  - In this review article an insight has been made into the strong possibility of the role of vasopressin (VP) in the control of circadian rhythms which has emerged from the results of the recent experiments in this field.  A role for VP, which is identified in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals, as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central nervous system has been postulated for some time now.  The presence of certain abnormalities in the circadian rhythms in VP deficient Brattleboro rats has suggested that this neuropeptide is a likely candidate in controlling circadian rhythms.  The coexistence of VP and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), their interrelation with reference to their role in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical glucocorticoid axis not only in states of stress but also in day-to-day life has also been discussed.  The possible role of dynorphin, which is co-synthesized with VP in the hypothalamic neurons, and other opioids in the control of circadian rhythms has been highlighted.  The pineal, SCN relation in the process of development of circadian rhythms has also been reviewed briefly.

AB  - Some 5-15% of children aged 3 to 15 years in both developing and developed countries suffer from mental handicaps.  There may be as many as 10-30 million severely and about 60-80 million mildly or moderately mentally retarded children in the world.  The conditions causing mental handicaps are largely preventable through primary health care measures in developing countries.
   Birth asphyxia and birth trauma are the leading causes of mental handicaps in developing countries where over 1.2 million newborns die each year from moderate or severe asphyxia and an equal number survive with severe morbidity due to brain damage.  The other preventable or manageable conditions are:  infections such as tuberculous and pyogenic meningitides and encephalopathies associated with measles and whooping cough; severe malnutrition in infancy; hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn; iodine deficiency; and iron deficiency anaemia in infancy and early childhood.  In addition, recent demographic and socioeconomic changes and an increase in the number of working mothers tend to deprive both infants and young children of stimulation for normal development.
   To improve this situation, the primary health care approach involving families and communities and instilling the spirit of self-care and self-help is indispensable.  Mothers and other family members, traditional birth attendants, community health workers, as well as nurse midwives and physicians should be involved in prevention and intervention activities, for which they should be trained and given knowledge and skills about appropriate technologies such as the risk approach, home-based maternal record, partograph, mobilogram (kick count), home-risk card, icterometer, and mouth-to-mask or bag and mask resuscitation of the newborn.  Most of these have been field-tested by WHO and can be used in the home, the health centre or day care centres to detect and prevent the above-mentioned conditions which can cause mental handicap.

AB  - The mechanisms that link sensory inputs in spatially separated regions of cortex can be elucidated by analyzing the mechanisms that generate receptive field properties in cortical neurons under conditions that mimic the waking state; a state when learning, memory and the modification of synaptic strength can be most readily demonstrated. Important advances in understanding receptive field mechanisms in sensory cortex have arisen from studying the precise relationship between the mystacial vibrissae or "whiskers" and their neural representation in separate cortical domains or "barrels". The anatomical precision of whisker projections to barrels permits a unique delineation of thalamocortical and intracortical components of cortical cell responses based on latency and security of response to peripheral receptor stimulation. When recorded in awake animals or even under very light anesthesia, cortical neurons show two components to their response to whisker movement. Neurons in layer IV of a whisker's primary projection zone respond with short latency (7-10 msec) and a high response magnitude (two or more action potentials (spikes) per stimulus). This "Center Receptive Field" (CRF) for layer IV cells is generated in large part by sensory fiber inputs from the thalamus. The CRF is restricted to 1.4 whiskers on average and is the only response detectable when cortical responses are depressed by deep anesthesia. In the "waking state" the same neuron often will respond to deflection of 4-6 surrounding whiskers, but only at longer latency (15-40 msec) and with fewer spikes per stimulus. These more labile responses form an excitatory surround receptive field (SRF). Sensory information that is transduced by individual whiskers and that generates the SRF of a cortical neuron achieves this added response complexity through intracortical mechanisms. The control of the mechanisms that determine the dissemination of sensory information within cortex include: (1) regulating the level of GABAergic inhibition; and (2) potentiation or depression of the response level generated by repeated sensory experience. State-dependent "modulatory" inputs to cortex, such as the noradrenergic and cholinergic fiber systems, could regulate the degree of horizontal spread of a sensory input, in part through global changes in the level of inhibition and/or regulating the amplitude of cortical responses, thereby determining the level of associative interactions between sensory inputs.
